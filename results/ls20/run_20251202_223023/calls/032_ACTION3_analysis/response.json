  "interpretation": "When ACTION3 was taken, two specific rectangular blocks, a color 12 (teal) block and a color 9 (purple) block, moved one unit to the left. The color 12 block moved from (40, 48) to (40, 47), and the color 9 block moved from (42, 48) to (42, 47). Additionally, one red 'move counter' dot in the top UI changed, likely becoming inactive (green), indicating one successful move was consumed.",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION3 moves the 'Block Stack 1' (composed of the color 12 and color 9 blocks) one unit to the left if the path is clear. It consumes one 'move' from the UI counter upon successful execution.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": true,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The presence of the color 12 rectangular block at (40, 48) and the color 9 rectangular block at (42, 48), directly to the right of the intended movement path, and the absence of any obstructions (like other blocks or the implicit left boundary) one unit to their left, allowed them to be moved by one unit in the leftward direction. The action successfully moved the designated blocks and consumed a move.",

There is open space directly to the left of these objects, allowing leftward movement. The top UI contains red and green dots, which act as a move counter.",
