  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been observed yet, making it the highest priority to test. Given that ACTION3 moved the blocks to the left, it's reasonable to expect ACTION4 to move them to the right. The current position allows for movement to the right without immediate obstruction from the environment (no walls directly to the right).",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe the effect of ACTION4, specifically if it moves the interactive blocks to the right, and if it consumes a move. This will help us validate its movement behavior and contribute to its verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state is good for testing ACTION4, as the main interactive blocks are not against any right-hand boundary, appearing to have space to move to the right."
