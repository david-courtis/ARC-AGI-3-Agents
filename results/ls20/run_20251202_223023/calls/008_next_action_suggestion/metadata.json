  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) upwards by one row, and consumes one move.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the stack of color 12 and color 9 rectangular blocks down by one row, assuming no obstructions.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 3 (green)\n\nBORDER: Yes (null)\n  Description: The play area appears to be bounded on the top, left, and right by the edge of the visible green background, which is bordered by a different shade of green (Color 6). The bottom border is marked by a line of smaller, light green (Color 6) rectangular blocks. There is also a distinct border at the top, which houses UI elements.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  The game appears to be played on a grid, indicated by the pixelated nature of all objects and the distinct rows and columns. The play area is largely open space defined by a primary background color (Color 3), bounded at the top by a distinct UI section, and at the bottom by a row of light green blocks (Color 6). The boundaries also include implicit walls at the left and right edges due to the change in background color (Color 6 on the very edges).\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a clear top UI section with move counters (red/green dots) and potentially a score/progress indicator (orange squares).\n  - Discovered a bottom boundary marked by a line of light green (Color 6) rectangular blocks.\n  - The background consists of at least two shades of green: Color 3 (main play area) and Color 6 (outer edges and bottom boundary). This suggests Color 6 serves as a wall/boundary color.\n  - The change in the UI (1 pixel change) at the top strongly suggests one of the red dots has changed, confirming its role as a move/turn indicator. A red dot turned green, indicating a used move or current turn.\n  - Confirmed specific objects (color 12 and color 9 blocks) are movable.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Objects can move upwards, as demonstrated by ACTION1.\n  - Objects are likely constrained by the implicit side walls (Color 6) and the explicit bottom wall (Color 6 blocks).\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - Move Counter Dot (Active): Color 8 (red) small square dot (Role: Move/Turn indicator)\n  - Move Counter Dot (Inactive): Color 13 (green) small square dot (Role: Move/Turn indicator)\n  - UI Score/Progress Indicator (Orange): Color 10 (orange) two small squares (Role: Score or progress display)\n  - Block stack 1: Color 12 (teal) and Color 9 (purple) rectangular blocks, stacked (Role: Interactive game pieces/player)\n  - Block 2 (Gold and Black): Color 11 (gold) and Color 0 (black) complex L-shaped block composed of multiple colors (Role: Obstacle or another interactive game piece)\n  - Block 3 (Black and Purple): Color 0 (black) and Color 9 (purple) small L-shaped block composed of multiple colors (Role: Obstacle or another interactive game piece)\n  - Bottom Boundary/Grid Indicator: Color 6 (light green) series of horizontal rectangular blocks (Role: Play area boundary or grid alignment guide)\n  - Block 4 (Black and Purple, bottom left): Color 0 (black) and Color 9 (purple) L-shaped block (Role: Obstacle or integral part of the environment, possibly a start/end point)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact function of the orange squares in the top-right UI? Score, level, or something else?\n  - Do the black/purple/gold blocks (Block 2, Block 3, Block 4) move or interact with other objects? Are they obstacles or goals?\n  - What happens when objects try to move downwards or horizontally? Are they blocked by the bottom boundary or other objects?\n  - What is the significance of the light green Color 6 background at the extreme edges? Does it act as an impassable wall?\n  - What does it mean for a red move counter dot to turn to a green dot? Is it consumed or activated?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION3 moves the color 12 and color 9 stacked blocks one unit to the left.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration.
