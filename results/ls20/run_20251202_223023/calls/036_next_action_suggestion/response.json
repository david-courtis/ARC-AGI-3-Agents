  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 6 consecutive 'no effect' attempts, with 3 recent ones. According to the rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying it. Since ACTION4 is the least tested of the movement actions (1/3 consistent), and we want to vary our position, moving right twice will provide a new context. This also allows us to move away from the current position where ACTION5 has proven to be ineffective. After moving, we can re-test ACTION5 in the new state, aiming to discover if it requires a specific context or interaction point.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 in a new position, we hope to start gathering consistent observations about its function. Specifically, we want to determine if it requires proximity to a different object (e.g., Block 2, Block 3, or Block 4) or a specific type of environment to have an effect. We will also observe if it now consumes a 'move', indicating a successful interaction. If it still has no effect, it will further confirm its context-dependent nature.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows 'Block Stack 1' (color 12 and 9) in a relatively central position, with other blocks (Block 2, Block 3, Block 4) scattered around. The previous attempts of ACTION5 resulted in no effect in this general area. The current position has not proven fruitful for ACTION5. Therefore, a change in position is crucial before re-evaluating ACTION5's behavior."
