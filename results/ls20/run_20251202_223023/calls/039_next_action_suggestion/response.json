  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 7 consecutive 'no-effect' attempts, and we have established that a 'no-effect' action should not be re-attempted in the same state. Therefore, we need to move 'Block Stack 1' to a new position. ACTION1 is partially verified and moves 'Block Stack 1' upwards. We will test ACTION5 after this movement to see if a change in position or proximity to other objects will trigger an effect. This strategic movement allows us to explore ACTION5's context-dependency.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We want to determine if ACTION5 has a contextual role, such as interacting with specific objects when 'Block Stack 1' is adjacent to them, or if it requires a different state than those previously tested. Moving 'Block Stack 1' to a new position (by using ACTION1) before re-testing ACTION5 might reveal its intended functionality. We also expect to get more validation for ACTION1 following its definition.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows 'Block Stack 1' (color 12 and 9) in a lower right section of the main play area. There is another L-shaped block (color 0 and 9) to the bottom-left and a larger L-shaped block (color 11 and 0) further up and to the right. ACTION5's repeated 'no-effect' suggests it's either an invalid action in current contexts or highly context-dependent. Moving 'Block Stack 1' is crucial to find a new context for ACTION5."
