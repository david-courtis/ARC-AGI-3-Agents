  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 5 consecutive 'no-effects' and therefore needs a setup sequence before re-testing. However, ACTION3 has only been attempted once and is currently 0/3 consistent, making it the least validated movement action. Testing an unverified movement action is a higher priority than attempting to find a context for ACTION5. We need to verify what ACTION3 does. Currently, Block Stack 1 is in an open area, which is a good state for testing basic movement actions. While we could use a setup sequence to move Block Stack 1, there's no immediate reason not to test ACTION3 from its current position, as it hasn't shown 'no-effect' from this specific spot.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify the effect of ACTION3 on Block Stack 1 (Color 12 and Color 9). Determine if it moves the stack LEFT, is blocked, or has another unforeseen effect. This will help us confirm its basic movement behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Block Stack 1' (Color 12 and Color 9) is positioned in an open segment of the play area, away from known obstacles or boundaries, providing a clear path for movement in multiple directions. This is an ideal state for testing movement actions. The other objects (Block 2, Block 3, Block 4) are static and appear to be environmental features or other puzzle elements."
