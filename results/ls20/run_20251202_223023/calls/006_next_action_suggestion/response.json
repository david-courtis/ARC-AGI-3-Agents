  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 and ACTION4 have not been observed at all, making them the highest priority for initial testing. Since there's no evidence yet that they are context-dependent, testing them from the current state is efficient. There's currently no specific obstacle to moving left from the current position of the main movable blocks (Color 12 and Color 9). We need to understand how horizontal movement works.",
  "expected_information_gain": "This will tell us if ACTION3 causes the blocks to move left, if they are blocked by the game's boundaries or other objects (like Block 4 in the bottom left), and if the move counter changes. This is crucial for understanding basic navigation.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is good for testing horizontal movement as the main movable blocks (Color 12 and Color 9) are in a relatively central position horizontally. We can observe if they interact with the left boundary or other blocks like Block 4 if they move far enough left."
