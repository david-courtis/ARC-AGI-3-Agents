  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect and has been tested multiple times in the current state or similar states. According to the rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before testing it again. However, since ACTION2 is largely unverified (0/3 consistent), and its last attempt involved moving the block stack downwards, which could be obstructed by the bottom boundary or another object, it is a priority to validate it further. Testing ACTION2 without a setup sequence directly addresses its validation status.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to either confirm the effect of ACTION2 (moving the block stack downwards) or learn about new movement constraints. If it moves the blocks downwards, we will gain more consistency for its definition. If it has no effect, it will tell us about a downward obstruction (likely the bottom boundary or another block) which will further refine our understanding of movement mechanics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows Block Stack 1 (Color 12 and Color 9) at a position where downward movement might be possible, but also close to other objects and the bottom boundary. ACTION5 has repeatedly shown no effect, so it needs a state change. ACTION2 needs more validation."
