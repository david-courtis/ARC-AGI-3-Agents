  "reasoning": "ACTION2 (Move DOWN) has never been observed, making it the highest priority for testing. We have one observation for ACTION1 moving blocks up, but nothing for moving down or horizontally. Testing ACTION2 will provide fundamental information about downward movement mechanics. The current state is suitable as there is space below the main stack of blocks (color 12 and 9) to potentially move them down, and there are no known obstacles immediately below them. Trying to move down will either succeed, fail, or interact with the bottom boundary, all of which are valuable observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "- Does ACTION2 move blocks downwards?\n- Does ACTION2 move the same blocks as ACTION1 (color 12 and 9)?\n- What happens if blocks try to move onto the bottom boundary (Color 6 blocks)?\n- What is the spatial granularity of movement (one row/column per action)?\n- Any associated cost (e.g., move counter change)?",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board has open space below the primary block stack (color 12 and 9), which means downward movement is a plausible action to test without immediate obstruction from other dynamic objects. The bottom border of Color 6 blocks is visible, providing a clear boundary to observe interactions with if objects move downwards."
