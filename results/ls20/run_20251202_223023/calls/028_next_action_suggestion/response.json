  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced 'no effect' results in its recent attempts. The critical rule states that if an action had no effect recently, we must use a setup sequence to move first. We need to test ACTION5 from a new position to see if context changes its behavior. Since ACTION4 has shown to move the block stack to the right, it is a suitable verified action to change the position for subsequent testing of ACTION5. We'll try just one step right to keep it simple, as we don't have many verified moves.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe if ACTION5 now produces an effect in a new spatial context, or if it continues to be a no-op regardless of the `Block Stack 1` position. This will help us understand if ACTION5 requires interaction with a specific object or boundary, or if it has a global effect. This will also provide another data point for ACTION4 to move, helping to verify it.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows 'Block Stack 1' (color 12 and 9) in the bottom-right quadrant of the main play area. There are other blocks 'Block 2' (color 11/0) and 'Block 3' (color 0/9) and 'Block 4' (color 0/9) on the board in other quadrants. The crucial aspect is that ACTION5 has failed multiple times in the current/similar positions. We need to change the position of 'Block Stack 1' to further test ACTION5."
