  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been observed and therefore has the highest priority for testing. Since the other actions have had effects, there is no need for a setup sequence to change the position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the function of ACTION5. It could be an 'interact' action, a 'select' action, or trigger a rotation of the blocks.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game state is currently open in the central area, with the movable blocks (Color 12 and 9) positioned near the center-right. There are other static blocks (gold/black L-shape, black/purple L-shape) in the vicinity. The current state is suitable for testing a new action like ACTION5 without immediate obstruction."
