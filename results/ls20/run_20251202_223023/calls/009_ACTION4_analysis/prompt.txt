Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

This is the FIRST time observing this action.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 3 (green)

BORDER: Yes (null)
  Description: The play area appears to be bounded on the top, left, and right by the edge of the visible green background, which is bordered by a different shade of green (Color 6). The bottom border is marked by a line of smaller, light green (Color 6) rectangular blocks. There is also a distinct border at the top, which houses UI elements.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  The game appears to be played on a grid, indicated by the pixelated nature of all objects and the distinct rows and columns. The play area is largely open space defined by a primary background color (Color 3), bounded at the top by a distinct UI section, and at the bottom by a row of light green blocks (Color 6). The boundaries also include implicit walls at the left and right edges due to the change in background color (Color 6 on the very edges).

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a clear top UI section with move counters (red/green dots) and potentially a score/progress indicator (orange squares).
  - Discovered a bottom boundary marked by a line of light green (Color 6) rectangular blocks.
  - The background consists of at least two shades of green: Color 3 (main play area) and Color 6 (outer edges and bottom boundary). This suggests Color 6 serves as a wall/boundary color.
  - The change in the UI (1 pixel change) at the top strongly suggests one of the red dots has changed, confirming its role as a move/turn indicator. A red dot turned green, indicating a used move or current turn.
  - Confirmed specific objects (color 12 and color 9 blocks) are movable.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Objects can move upwards, as demonstrated by ACTION1.
  - Objects are likely constrained by the implicit side walls (Color 6) and the explicit bottom wall (Color 6 blocks).

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - Move Counter Dot (Active): Color 8 (red) small square dot (Role: Move/Turn indicator)
  - Move Counter Dot (Inactive): Color 13 (green) small square dot (Role: Move/Turn indicator)
  - UI Score/Progress Indicator (Orange): Color 10 (orange) two small squares (Role: Score or progress display)
  - Block stack 1: Color 12 (teal) and Color 9 (purple) rectangular blocks, stacked (Role: Interactive game pieces/player)
  - Block 2 (Gold and Black): Color 11 (gold) and Color 0 (black) complex L-shaped block composed of multiple colors (Role: Obstacle or another interactive game piece)
  - Block 3 (Black and Purple): Color 0 (black) and Color 9 (purple) small L-shaped block composed of multiple colors (Role: Obstacle or another interactive game piece)
  - Bottom Boundary/Grid Indicator: Color 6 (light green) series of horizontal rectangular blocks (Role: Play area boundary or grid alignment guide)
  - Block 4 (Black and Purple, bottom left): Color 0 (black) and Color 9 (purple) L-shaped block (Role: Obstacle or integral part of the environment, possibly a start/end point)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What is the exact function of the orange squares in the top-right UI? Score, level, or something else?
  - Do the black/purple/gold blocks (Block 2, Block 3, Block 4) move or interact with other objects? Are they obstacles or goals?
  - What happens when objects try to move downwards or horizontally? Are they blocked by the bottom boundary or other objects?
  - What is the significance of the light green Color 6 background at the extreme edges? Does it act as an impassable wall?
  - What does it mean for a red move counter dot to turn to a green dot? Is it consumed or activated?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION3 moves the color 12 and color 9 stacked blocks one unit to the left.
