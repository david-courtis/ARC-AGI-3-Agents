  "interpretation": "When ACTION4 was taken, two specific rectangular blocks, a color 12 (teal) block and a color 9 (purple) block, moved one unit to the right. The color 12 block moved from (32, 40) to (32, 41), and the color 9 block moved from (34, 40) to (34, 41). Additionally, one red 'move counter' dot in the top UI changed, likely becoming inactive (green), indicating one successful move was consumed.",
