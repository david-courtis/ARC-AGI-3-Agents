  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 3 consecutive 'no effect' attempts. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence of verified movement actions to move the 'player' (Block Stack 1) to a different position before retrying ACTION5. Since we do not have any verified actions yet, we need to continue exploring the basic movement actions. ACTION1 has only been attempted once and is not yet consistent. It's important to gather more observations for ACTION1 to either verify it or identify its full effect. As the current state allows for upward movement (there's space above Block Stack 1), this is a good opportunity to test ACTION1 again.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further observation of ACTION1's effect on Block Stack 1, specifically if it consistently moves the blocks up and consumes a move. This will help us get closer to verifying ACTION1.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player' (Block Stack 1: color 12 and color 9 blocks) is positioned in a central-right area of the main play grid. There is ample space above, below, to the left, and to the right for movement. The top UI elements (move counter, score) are visible and distinct. The other block objects (Block 2, Block 3, Block 4) are static and serve as potential obstacles or interaction points. The current state is suitable for testing any of the basic movement actions without immediate obstruction."
