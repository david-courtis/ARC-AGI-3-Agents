  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has 0/3 consistent observations and recently had a 'no effect' attempt. To strategically learn its behavior, we need to move the 'Block Stack 1' to a new, unobstructed position before re-testing. Since we already know ACTION1 moves the block stack upwards, we will use it as a setup. The goal is to move the stack away from any potential right-side obstructions visible in the current state to properly evaluate ACTION4. Moving it up will help clear the way for horizontal movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving 'Block Stack 1' to a new position (further up, potentially away from right-side obstacles), we aim to get a successful execution of ACTION4. This will help us verify its definition and confirm if it consistently moves the object to the right. If it still has no effect, it provides more context about potential hidden obstacles or specific movement rules for ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Block Stack 1' (color 12 and 9) is positioned such that its right side is near or adjacent to the larger purple and cyan block. This might be causing the 'no effect' result for ACTION4. Moving it upwards using ACTION1 should clear this potential obstruction and allow for better testing of ACTION4."
