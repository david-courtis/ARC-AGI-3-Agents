  "reasoning": "ACTION4 is a pending action that needs more validation (currently 1/3 consistent). We have only observed one instance of its effect, and it was the first action in the recent history. While ACTION5 is exhausted, we cannot retest it in the same state due to its recent no-effects. The current position appears suitable for testing rightward movement, as 'Block Stack 1' is not at the extreme right edge of the visible play area. All other pending actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3) have also only been observed once and need further validation, but ACTION4 was the most recent successful action for movement. Prioritizing re-validating a recently successful action is a good strategy to build confidence for future setup sequences.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Confirming the effect of ACTION4 (moving Block Stack 1 right by one unit) for the second time. This will bring us closer to verifying ACTION4 and making it available for reliable use in setup sequences. We expect to see specific color blocks (12 and 9) move to the right by one unit, and the 'move counter' to diminish by one active dot.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Block Stack 1' (color 12 and 9) is positioned in the upper-middle right area of the main play space. It does not appear to be immediately adjacent to the right boundary (Color 6), suggesting unhindered movement to the right is possible. The play area is largely open around the stack, making it a good state to test basic movement actions. ACTION5 has had repeated no-effects, but this does not impact the current test of ACTION4 as they are distinct actions. The environment is clear for a right movement."
