  "reasoning": "ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 all have one consistent observation, but none are fully verified. Given the current position of the 'Block Stack 1' (color 12 and color 9 blocks) to the right side of the main play area, trying ACTION1 again from this new position will help confirm its behavior. ACTION4 was recently observed to have effect, confirming it moves the block right, but it also had a recent no-effect attempt, so we should move to a different position before trying it again to get further validation. ACTION5 is exhausted and does not seem to have any effect in the current context hence should be avoided. The current game state is suitable for testing upward movement as there are no obvious obstructions immediately above the block stack.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get a second consistent observation for ACTION1, moving 'Block Stack 1' upwards. This will bring us closer to verifying ACTION1 and ensure its behavior is consistent regardless of horizontal positioning.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Block Stack 1' (color 12 and color 9 blocks) is currently located on the right side of the main play area. There appear to be no immediate obstructions above it, making it a good state to test upward movement (ACTION1). The previous movement attempts (ACTION4, ACTION3, ACTION2, ACTION1) have moved this block stack to this position."
