  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the current state and should not be re-tested without a position change. ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 have all had one successful test. ACTION4 also only has one successful test. To continue gathering data and attempting to verify the movement actions, it's best to rotate through the remaining movement actions. We have one observation for each movement action, so picking one of them to test again is a good next step. Since we last observed ACTION3, testing ACTION4 next will help confirm its behavior and gather more data for its verification. Also, we haven't seen an action with 'NO EFFECT' for ACTION4. We need two more observations for ACTION4 to verify it. Since we rotated after ACTION3 and ACTION4, it is a good idea to continue cycling between the movement actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe ACTION4 moving the stack of blocks to the right by one unit and consuming a move. This will provide another observation towards verifying ACTION4's behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state is suitable for testing a movement action (ACTION4) as the stack of blocks is in a central position and not immediately adjacent to any known boundaries on its right side. Testing another movement action will allow us to gather more data for verification and get closer to confirming the behavior of ACTION4."
