  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has only 1/3 consistent observations and needs more validation. It previously moved the block stack down. Since ACTION1 recently moved the block stack up, the current position should be good for testing downward movement, as it's not against the bottom boundary. This allows for validation in a different position than previous tests.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To gather another consistent observation for ACTION2, verifying its ability to move the block stack downwards, its interaction with boundaries, and confirmation of move consumption. This will help us determine if it has 3 consistent observations.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Block Stack 1' (color 12 and 9) is currently located in a free-moving space, probably higher than its previous position due to the last ACTION1. This provides an opportunity to test downward movement without immediate obstruction, allowing for a clearer observation of ACTION2's effect."
