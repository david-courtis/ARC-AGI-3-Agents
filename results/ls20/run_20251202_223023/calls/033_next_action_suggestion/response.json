  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced no effect in the current contexts, indicating that its functionality is context-dependent. To properly test ACTION5 and hopefully trigger an effect, we need to move the player controlled Block Stack 1 to a different position. Since all movement actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) have partial consistency and we have not yet verified any of them, we rely on the observed effect of ACTION4 to move the block. A single ACTION4 should move the block one unit to the right, changing its relative position to other objects or boundaries and potentially enabling ACTION5. The goal is to move the player object away from the previous 'no-effect' positions for ACTION5. ACTION4 has been observed to move the block right, so it's a good candidate for a setup move.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION5 after moving Block Stack 1 with ACTION4, we aim to discover if ACTION5's effect is triggered by proximity to another object or a specific spatial context. We want to see if ACTION5 can now 'interact' or 'select' something in this new position, potentially revealing its true purpose. If it still has no effect, it further strengthens the hypothesis that ACTION5 requires a very specific context or target.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows Block Stack 1 (Color 12 and Color 9) in the center-right part of the main play area. There are other objects (Block 2, Block 3, Block 4) present, but we haven't determined interaction mechanics. ACTION5 has had no effect in previous attempts. We need to strategically move Block Stack 1 to different locations to see if ACTION5 becomes active. Moving to the right using ACTION4 will change the position relative to Block 2, which is currently above and slightly to the right of Block Stack 1, and also relative to the right boundary."
