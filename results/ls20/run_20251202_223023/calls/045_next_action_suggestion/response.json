  "reasoning": "ACTION4 recently had no effect, so it cannot be tested again in the same state. We need to move the 'Block Stack 1' to a different position. Since no actions are fully verified, we will use a sequence of partially understood actions to move the blocks. ACTION3 moves left, ACTION1 moves up, and ACTION2 moves down. This sequence should result in a changed position for Block Stack 1, allowing us to re-test ACTION4. This also helps to validate the partially understood actions by observing their effects in more contexts.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By re-testing ACTION4 after moving 'Block Stack 1', we hope to observe its effect and gain more consistent observations towards its verification. We also hope to gather more consistent observations for ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 by using them in the setup sequence.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Block Stack 1' is in a relatively central position. ACTION4 previously had no effect from this position. ACTION5 is exhausted and should not be tested. Other actions are partially understood but not verified."
