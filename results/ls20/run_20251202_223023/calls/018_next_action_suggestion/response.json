  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had two recent consecutive 'no effect' attempts. The rule states that if an action had no effect, we MUST move first. Additionally, the description of ACTION5 suggests it might be for 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position'. To test its 'INTERACT' capability, it's crucial to be near another object that it could potentially interact with. Currently, the main interactive block stack is relatively isolated. Moving it significantly to the right (using the somewhat verified ACTION4) would place it closer to the gold and black L-shaped block (Block 2) and the black and purple L-shaped block (Block 3). This setup will allow us to test ACTION5 effectively in a new context, specifically for interaction with other objects, which seems to be its most probable function given its generic description and previous 'no effect' attempts when not near anything specific. If it still has no effect, it's important to try it in different positions to learn its context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to gain information about ACTION5's behavior. By moving the primary interactive blocks near other objects, we can test if ACTION5 enables interaction, selection, or rotation of those objects or the moved blocks themselves. This will help us determine if ACTION5 is context-dependent for interaction, or if its previous 'no effect' attempts were simply due to a lack of valid targets in its immediate vicinity. It will also help us validate the consistency of ACTION4's movement.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the interactive block stack (Color 12 and Color 9) in a relatively central but isolated position. There are other distinct objects (Block 2, Block 3, and Block 4) in the environment, but the main interactive stack is not adjacent to them. The previous attempts of ACTION5 resulted in no effect, which is likely due to the lack of an interactable object or an invalid position for its intended function. Moving closer to another object, particularly Block 2 or Block 3, is a strategic move to properly test the 'INTERACT' aspect of ACTION5. ACTION4 is a good candidate for movement in the setup, as it has had 1 consistent observation out of 2 attempts, making it somewhat reliable for simply changing position."
