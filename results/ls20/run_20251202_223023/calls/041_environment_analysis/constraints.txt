- Objects can move upwards, as demonstrated by ACTION1.
- Objects are constrained by the implicit side walls (Color 6) and the explicit bottom wall (Color 6 blocks).
- Objects are constrained by the implicit side walls (Color 6) in the outermost perimeter.
- Objects are constrained by the explicit bottom wall (Color 6 blocks).
- Movement was blocked when ACTION5 was taken, indicating an impassable barrier or occupied space where the intended movement would have gone.
- Movement is constrained by the play area's implicit top boundary just below the UI, where actionable objects cannot pass into the UI section.
- Blocked movements do not consume a turn, as evidenced by ACTION5 having no effect on the move counter.
- Movement was blocked in the direction attempted by ACTION5. This could be due to a boundary or another object.
- Movement was blocked in the direction attempted by ACTION5.
- The area where Block Stack 1 (Color 12 and Color 9) is located is currently empty space available for movement, based on its previous upward movement in ACTION1.
- Objects can move upwards.
- Objects are constrained by the implicit side walls (Color 6).
- ACTION5 attempting movement was blocked by an obstacle or boundary, as there were no UI changes (e.g., move consumption).
- Objects are constrained from moving into or beyond Color 6 boundaries (implicit side walls, explicit bottom wall).
- Objects are constrained from moving into the UI section at the top of the screen.
- Any space occupied by Color 6 prevents movement, whether it's an explicit block or the background.
