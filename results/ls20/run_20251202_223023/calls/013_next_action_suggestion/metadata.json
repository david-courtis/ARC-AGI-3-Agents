  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) upwards by one row, and consumes one move.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the stack of color 12 and color 9 rectangular blocks down by one row, assuming no obstructions.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 3 (green)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 6 (light green))\n  Description: The play area is bounded on the top, left, and right by the edge of the visible green background, which is bordered by a different shade of green (Color 6). The bottom border is marked by a line of smaller, light green (Color 6) rectangular blocks. There is also a distinct border at the top, which houses UI elements.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  The game appears to be played on a grid, indicated by the pixelated nature of all objects and the distinct rows and columns. The play area is largely open space defined by a primary background color (Color 3), bounded at the top by a distinct UI section, and at the bottom by a row of light green blocks (Color 6). The boundaries also include implicit walls at the left and right edges due to the change in background color (Color 6 on the very edges).\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a clear top UI section with move counters (red/green dots) and potentially a score/progress indicator (orange squares).\n  - Discovered a bottom boundary marked by a line of light green (Color 6) rectangular blocks.\n  - The background consists of at least two shades of green: Color 3 (main play area) and Color 6 (outer edges and bottom boundary). This suggests Color 6 serves as a wall/boundary color.\n  - The change in the UI (1 pixel change) at the top strongly suggests one of the red dots has changed, confirming its role as a move/turn indicator. A red dot turned green, indicating a used move or current turn.\n  - Confirmed specific objects (color 12 and color 9 blocks) are movable.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION5's lack of effect implies a movement constraint. Specifically, attempting to move in the direction of ACTION5 was blocked by an obstacle or boundary, as there were no UI changes (e.g., move consumption). This suggests that movement attempts into blocked spaces do not consume a move.\n  - The absence of a move counter change when ACTION5 had no effect indicates that only successful or meaningful actions consume a move. Failed actions (blocked movements) do not cost a turn.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Objects can move upwards, as demonstrated by ACTION1.\n  - Objects are likely constrained by the implicit side walls (Color 6) and the explicit bottom wall (Color 6 blocks).\n  - Objects are likely constrained by the implicit side walls (Color 6) in the outermost perimeter.\n  - Objects are likely constrained by the explicit bottom wall (Color 6 blocks).\n  - Movement was blocked when ACTION5 was taken, indicating an impassable barrier or occupied space where the intended movement would have gone.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - Move Counter Dot (Active): Color 8 (red) small square dot (Role: Move/Turn indicator)\n  - Move Counter Dot (Inactive): Color 13 (green) small square dot (Role: Move/Turn indicator)\n  - UI Score/Progress Indicator (Orange): Color 10 (orange) two small squares (Role: Score or progress display)\n  - Block stack 1: Color 12 (teal) and Color 9 (purple) rectangular blocks, stacked (Role: Interactive game pieces/player)\n  - Block 2 (Gold and Black): Color 11 (gold) and Color 0 (black) complex L-shaped block composed of multiple colors (Role: Obstacle or another interactive game piece)\n  - Block 3 (Black and Purple): Color 0 (black) and Color 9 (purple) small L-shaped block composed of multiple colors (Role: Obstacle or another interactive game piece)\n  - Bottom Boundary/Grid Indicator: Color 6 (light green) series of horizontal rectangular blocks (Role: Play area boundary or grid alignment guide)\n  - Block 4 (Black and Purple, bottom left): Color 0 (black) and Color 9 (purple) L-shaped block (Role: Obstacle or integral part of the environment, possibly a start/end point)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact function of the orange squares in the top-right UI? Score, level, or something else?\n  - Do the black/purple/gold blocks (Block 2, Block 3, Block 4) move or interact with other objects? Are they obstacles or goals?\n  - What happens when objects try to move downwards or horizontally? Are they blocked by the bottom boundary or other objects?\n  - What is the significance of the light green Color 6 background at the extreme edges? Does it act as an impassable wall?\n  - Which object caused ACTION5 to have no effect? Was it a boundary or another object?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION3 moves the color 12 and color 9 stacked blocks one unit to the left.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect on the objects currently observed in the play area or the UI.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt from the last position. According to the critical rule, we must first change the position of the movable blocks. Since none of the movement actions are verified, we will use ACTION1 as it has caused a clear effect previously, confirming it moves the blocks upwards. We want to test ACTION5 again in a new state to try and understand its functionality. Moving the blocks up might place them in a different context where ACTION5 could have an effect, for instance, if ACTION5 is an interaction with something above the blocks or a rotation that is only possible when not at the bottom border.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By moving the blocks to a new vertical position and re-testing ACTION5, we either discover its effect in the new context, or we gather more information that it's context-dependent on horizontal or a specific vertical position, or it simply does nothing under these current conditions. This will help us narrow down what ACTION5 actually does.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The movable blocks are currently near the bottom of the play area. ACTION5 previously had no effect. The current position might be hindering the intended effect of ACTION5. Moving them up will change their spatial relation to other objects and boundaries, providing a different context for testing ACTION5."
