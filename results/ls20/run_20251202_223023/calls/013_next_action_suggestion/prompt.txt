CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) upwards by one row, and consumes one move.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the stack of color 12 and color 9 rectangular blocks down by one row, assuming no obstructions.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 3 (green)

BORDER: Yes (Color 6 (light green))
  Description: The play area is bounded on the top, left, and right by the edge of the visible green background, which is bordered by a different shade of green (Color 6). The bottom border is marked by a line of smaller, light green (Color 6) rectangular blocks. There is also a distinct border at the top, which houses UI elements.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  The game appears to be played on a grid, indicated by the pixelated nature of all objects and the distinct rows and columns. The play area is largely open space defined by a primary background color (Color 3), bounded at the top by a distinct UI section, and at the bottom by a row of light green blocks (Color 6). The boundaries also include implicit walls at the left and right edges due to the change in background color (Color 6 on the very edges).

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a clear top UI section with move counters (red/green dots) and potentially a score/progress indicator (orange squares).
  - Discovered a bottom boundary marked by a line of light green (Color 6) rectangular blocks.
  - The background consists of at least two shades of green: Color 3 (main play area) and Color 6 (outer edges and bottom boundary). This suggests Color 6 serves as a wall/boundary color.
  - The change in the UI (1 pixel change) at the top strongly suggests one of the red dots has changed, confirming its role as a move/turn indicator. A red dot turned green, indicating a used move or current turn.
  - Confirmed specific objects (color 12 and color 9 blocks) are movable.
  - Confirmed that ACTION5's lack of effect implies a movement constraint. Specifically, attempting to move in the direction of ACTION5 was blocked by an obstacle or boundary, as there were no UI changes (e.g., move consumption). This suggests that movement attempts into blocked spaces do not consume a move.
  - The absence of a move counter change when ACTION5 had no effect indicates that only successful or meaningful actions consume a move. Failed actions (blocked movements) do not cost a turn.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Objects can move upwards, as demonstrated by ACTION1.
  - Objects are likely constrained by the implicit side walls (Color 6) and the explicit bottom wall (Color 6 blocks).
  - Objects are likely constrained by the implicit side walls (Color 6) in the outermost perimeter.
  - Objects are likely constrained by the explicit bottom wall (Color 6 blocks).
  - Movement was blocked when ACTION5 was taken, indicating an impassable barrier or occupied space where the intended movement would have gone.

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - Move Counter Dot (Active): Color 8 (red) small square dot (Role: Move/Turn indicator)
  - Move Counter Dot (Inactive): Color 13 (green) small square dot (Role: Move/Turn indicator)
  - UI Score/Progress Indicator (Orange): Color 10 (orange) two small squares (Role: Score or progress display)
  - Block stack 1: Color 12 (teal) and Color 9 (purple) rectangular blocks, stacked (Role: Interactive game pieces/player)
  - Block 2 (Gold and Black): Color 11 (gold) and Color 0 (black) complex L-shaped block composed of multiple colors (Role: Obstacle or another interactive game piece)
  - Block 3 (Black and Purple): Color 0 (black) and Color 9 (purple) small L-shaped block composed of multiple colors (Role: Obstacle or another interactive game piece)
  - Bottom Boundary/Grid Indicator: Color 6 (light green) series of horizontal rectangular blocks (Role: Play area boundary or grid alignment guide)
  - Block 4 (Black and Purple, bottom left): Color 0 (black) and Color 9 (purple) L-shaped block (Role: Obstacle or integral part of the environment, possibly a start/end point)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What is the exact function of the orange squares in the top-right UI? Score, level, or something else?
  - Do the black/purple/gold blocks (Block 2, Block 3, Block 4) move or interact with other objects? Are they obstacles or goals?
  - What happens when objects try to move downwards or horizontally? Are they blocked by the bottom boundary or other objects?
  - What is the significance of the light green Color 6 background at the extreme edges? Does it act as an impassable wall?
  - Which object caused ACTION5 to have no effect? Was it a boundary or another object?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION3 moves the color 12 and color 9 stacked blocks one unit to the left.
  - ACTION5 had no effect on the objects currently observed in the play area or the UI.
