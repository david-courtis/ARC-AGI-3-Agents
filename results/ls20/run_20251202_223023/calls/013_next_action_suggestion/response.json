  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt from the last position. According to the critical rule, we must first change the position of the movable blocks. Since none of the movement actions are verified, we will use ACTION1 as it has caused a clear effect previously, confirming it moves the blocks upwards. We want to test ACTION5 again in a new state to try and understand its functionality. Moving the blocks up might place them in a different context where ACTION5 could have an effect, for instance, if ACTION5 is an interaction with something above the blocks or a rotation that is only possible when not at the bottom border.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the blocks to a new vertical position and re-testing ACTION5, we either discover its effect in the new context, or we gather more information that it's context-dependent on horizontal or a specific vertical position, or it simply does nothing under these current conditions. This will help us narrow down what ACTION5 actually does.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable blocks are currently near the bottom of the play area. ACTION5 previously had no effect. The current position might be hindering the intended effect of ACTION5. Moving them up will change their spatial relation to other objects and boundaries, providing a different context for testing ACTION5."
