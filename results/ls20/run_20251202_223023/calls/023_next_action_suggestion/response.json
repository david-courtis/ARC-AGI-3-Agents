  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 3 consecutive 'no-effect' outcomes in recent history. The critical rule states that if an action had no effect, it must not be repeated in the same state. Therefore, it is necessary to move the actionable object (Block Stack 1) to a new position before re-testing ACTION5. Since we want to understand what ACTION5 does, we need to try it in a different context. Moving the block stack to the right away from its current position gives a new scenario. ACTION4 is chosen because it has shown to move the block successfully to the right, and we still need to verify its consistency to reach 3/3 observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing 'ACTION4' twice, we aim to confirm its consistent behavior of moving Block Stack 1 to the right and accumulate more observations towards its verification. After moving, re-testing ACTION5 will help us determine if it functions as an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action and whether a change in position or proximity to other objects will trigger an effect. This will help us understand the context-dependency of ACTION5.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows Block Stack 1 (color 12 and 9) located in a relatively open area. There are other static blocks (Block 2, Block 3, Block 4) in the environment. Having ACTION5 fail repeatedly suggests it's either context-sensitive or simply not an active action without a specific target. Moving to a new location allows us to test if proximity to another object or a different spatial position enables ACTION5 to have an effect. The current position has not yielded any effect for ACTION5, so a change of position is critical."
