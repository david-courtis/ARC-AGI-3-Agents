Describe what happened when the action was taken\n2. Build/update a definition of what this action does\n3. Note any objects or environment features involved\n4. Track whether the action had any visible effect\n\nIMPORTANT - UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS:\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that count SUCCESSFUL moves\n- When an action HAS EFFECT (moves something), the move counter typically decreases\n- Changes in UI elements (e.g., red dots disappearing) indicate move consumption, NOT action effects\n- Focus on what happened in the PLAY AREA, not just UI changes\n- Running out of moves (counter reaches zero) causes game failure and reset\n\nBe precise and evidence-based. If you're uncertain, say so."

Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-55], cols [2-47]\n\nOBJECT-LEVEL ANALYSIS (grouped by visual proximity/similarity):\nMOVED: 2 objects\n  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved up\n  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved up\n\nOBJECTS BEFORE ACTION:\nDetected 20 objects:\n\nColor 3: 9 objects\n  - 48x48 shape at row 8, col 8\n  - 4x1 block at row 62, col 12\n  - 4x1 block at row 62, col 17\n  - 4x1 block at row 62, col 22\n  - 4x1 block at row 62, col 27\n  - 4x1 block at row 62, col 32\n  - 4x1 block at row 62, col 37\n  - 4x1 block at row 62, col 42\n  - 4x1 block at row 62, col 47\n\nColor 4: 2 objects\n  - 64x64 shape at row 0, col 0\n  - 8x16 block at row 16, col 16\n\nColor 5: 1 objects\n  - 8x8 shape at row 16, col 32\n\nColor 8: 3 objects\n  - 2x2 block at row 1, col 52\n  - 2x2 block at row 1, col 56\n  - 2x2 block at row 1, col 60\n\nColor 9: 4 objects\n  - 2x2 block at row 18, col 34\n  - 2x2 block at row 32, col 32\n  - 8x6 block at row 50, col 40\n  - 3x3 block at row 54, col 1\n\nColor 12: 1 objects\n  - 8x2 block at row 48, col 40\n\nI'm showing you:\n1. The frame BEFORE the action (first image)\n2. The frame AFTER the action (second image)\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!\n2. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context\n3. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)\n4. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect\n5. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.\n\nAnalyze what happened and provide your structured analysis."
