  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been attempted, making it a high priority for initial observation. All other actions have at least one attempt, but none are verified. Addressing the completely unobserved action first is efficient. The current state does not appear to be detrimental to observing ACTION5's effect (or lack thereof).",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a first observation of what ACTION5 does (or confirms it does nothing), which will move it from 0/3 consistent observations. This is a critical first step for any action.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows various blocks and UI elements. There are no obvious conditions that would prevent a general action test. Pixel (42,40) is currently color 12 and (40,40) is color 9. The top_ui pixel is color 3. The lower-right playarea block has various colors, including 3 and 12. We have not identified any specific 'good' or 'bad' states for testing most actions yet, so a neutral state is fine for a first attempt of an unobserved action."
