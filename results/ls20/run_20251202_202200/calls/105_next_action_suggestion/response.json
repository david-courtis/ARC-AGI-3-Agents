  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted even once (0/8 attempts). Prioritizing the testing of unseen actions is crucial for initial exploration to gather fundamental understanding.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We will learn if ACTION5 truly has no effect, or if its effect is conditional, subtle, or only apparent after a certain state or sequence of actions. This will allow us to move it from 'unattempted' status.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and doesn't seem to preclude testing ACTION5, as its prior definition suggests it might have no visible effect regardless of state. Therefore, no specific setup is needed."
