  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been attempted yet, which makes it the top priority for testing to gather initial observations. All other actions have at least one attempt, so starting with the completely unexplored action is the most efficient way to broaden our knowledge base.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We anticipate gaining initial observations about ACTION5. This could confirm if it has no effect, or if it produces a novel change that was not previously observed due to insufficient testing. Specifically, we want to know if it changes any pixels or UI elements. Each previous attempt defined 'no visible change' based on one trial, so we need to see what it does on current state.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state appears to be a generic game state. There are no obvious features or conditions that would directly interfere with testing ACTION5, which is currently theorized to have no visible effect or a subtle one. Therefore, no setup sequence is required."
