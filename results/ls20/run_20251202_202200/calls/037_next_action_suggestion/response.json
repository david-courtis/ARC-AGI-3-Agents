  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has zero attempts, making it the highest priority for initial testing. All other actions have at least one attempt, meaning they have provided some initial information. Since there are no verified actions yet, a setup sequence is not possible. The current board state appears to be a neutral starting point, suitable for testing an action with no known effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To establish a baseline understanding of ACTION5. We aim to confirm if it truly has no visible effect, or if its effect is subtle, conditional, or requires a different game state for manifestation. This will bring it to 1/3 consistent observations.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board is in a standard, un-modified state. There is a prominent green background with various small, colored blocks and pixels, including UI elements. This state is generally suitable for initial testing of any action where specific preconditions are not yet known."
