  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been attempted, making it the highest priority for initial testing. Successfully verifying it as 'no visible change' or discovering a subtle effect is crucial for a complete understanding of available actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to either confirm that ACTION5 has no observable effect or to detect a subtle, previously unobserved interaction. This will move us closer to verifying its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state is general and not specifically tailored to any known action. Since ACTION5 is hypothesized to have no visible effect, the current state is as good as any to test it initially."
