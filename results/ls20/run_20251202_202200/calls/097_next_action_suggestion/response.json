  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been attempted at all yet (0/8 attempts). Prioritizing untested actions is the most efficient way to progress exploration. While previous attempts have suggested 'no visible change', this is a hypothesis that needs further validation across multiple states.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to definitively confirm if ACTION5 truly has no effect, or if its effect is conditional or very subtle. Observing it in the current state might reveal something previously missed or, at the very least, add another data point to the 'no effect' hypothesis, moving it closer to verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state appears neutral and doesn't seem to favor or hinder the testing of any particular action, especially one thought to have no effect. There's no obvious critical state that needs to be preserved or altered before attempting to test ACTION5."
