  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been attempted even once. It's the highest priority to get initial observations for actions we know nothing about. Since its current definition suggests 'no visible change', any state is as good as any other for initial testing.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get the first observation for ACTION5. This could confirm if it truly has no effect or if its effect is conditional or subtle, helping us begin its validation process. This is critical for understanding what this action does.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely irrelevant for testing ACTION5, as its prior description suggests no visual change. This makes it an ideal state for an initial, untargeted test."
