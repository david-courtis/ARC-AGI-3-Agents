    "interpretation": "The primary change appears to be in the lower-right area of the play area. A block of pixels that were previously a mix of colors 12 (blue-green) and 9 (dark purple) have been largely replaced by color 3 (green), while a block of pixels that were color 3 (green) have been replaced by color 12 (blue-green). There was also a single pixel change in the top-left UI area, where color 15 (purple) became color 3 (green). There are numerous other small pixel changes across the frame, including many pixels changing from color 3 to 12. It looks like colors 3 and 12 are swapping in many places, particularly in the lower-right.",
    "action_definition": "ACTION3 causes specific color swaps. Notably, it changes blocks of color 3 to color 12 and blocks of color 12 (and possibly 9) to color 3, especially in the lower-right area. It also seems to affect a UI element, changing color 15 to color 3.",
