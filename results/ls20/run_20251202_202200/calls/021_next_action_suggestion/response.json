  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted even once. It is a high priority to get at least one observation for every action to determine its initial effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get a first observation for ACTION5 and see if it causes any discernible changes or if it truly is a 'no-op' action as initially hypothesized.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing any action, as no specific conditions are currently known to be required or detrimental for any pending action. Given that ACTION5 has never been tried, the current state is as good as any."
