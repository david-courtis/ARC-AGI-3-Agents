  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has zero attempts, making it the highest priority for initial testing. All other actions have had at least one attempt, so we should prioritize discovering the initial effects of ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe any changes, no matter how subtle, caused by ACTION5. This would allow us to formulate an initial hypothesis for its effect, moving it from 'no visible change' to a more concrete description. If it still shows no change, we would log this as a second attempt at observing no effect, pushing it closer to verification of having no effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing any unobserved action as we are in the early stages of exploration and not testing for specific contextual effects. There are no clear 'bad' states for an unobserved action at this point."
