  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted even once. It is a high priority to get initial observations for all actions. The current board state doesn't seem to be particularly good or bad for testing ACTION5, as its effect definition states it might have no visible change or a very subtle one. Given no specific state is needed or hindered for ACTION5's initial test, it's best to test it now to get an initial observation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "An initial observation of ACTION5. This will tell us if it truly has no effect, or if we can start to define a subtle effect, or perhaps find conditions under which it does have an effect. This is crucial for completing our understanding of all available actions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is a typical game state without any particularly unusual features that would obstruct or specifically enable testing any of the unknown actions. The UI elements and play area elements are present as described in previous observations."
