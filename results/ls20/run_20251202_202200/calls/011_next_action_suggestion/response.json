  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been attempted (0/8 attempts), making it the highest priority for initial exploration. All other actions have at least one attempt, meaning we have some preliminary, albeit inconsistent, data for them. Prioritizing actions with zero observations ensures we cast a wide net in the initial exploration phase.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the initial effect of ACTION5. Since its current definition states 'no visible change', verifying or refuting this initial hypothesis is crucial. We will either confirm it truly has no effect, or discover a subtle effect missed previously.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is neutral and suitable for testing any unobserved action. There are no specific conditions or objects that ACTION5's placeholder definition suggests it might interact with, so no setup is required."
