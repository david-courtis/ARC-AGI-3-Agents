  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet (0/8 attempts). To efficiently explore the game, we prioritize actions that have never been observed to gather initial data.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe any potential visible effects of ACTION5, which currently has no observed effect. This will allow us to start forming a hypothesis about its function or confirm its lack of visible impact.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic, without any specific features that would uniquely aid or hinder the testing of ACTION5, which is currently hypothesized to have no visible effect. Therefore, no setup sequence is necessary."
