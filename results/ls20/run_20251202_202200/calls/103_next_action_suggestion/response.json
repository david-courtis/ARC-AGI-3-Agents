  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been attempted at all yet (0/8 attempts). This makes it a high priority to test to begin gathering initial observations. All other actions have at least one attempt.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get the first observation for ACTION5, which will help us understand if it has any observable effect or if it truly does nothing (or its effect is conditional). This is crucial for systematically eliminating actions or understanding their impact.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing any action that does not require specific environmental conditions (like movement against a wall). Since we have no information on ACTION5, there's no reason to believe the current state is bad for testing it."
