  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been observed even once (0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts). It is the highest priority simply because we have no initial data for it. The current game state doesn't seem to actively hinder testing any action, and since we don't know what ACTION5 does, no specific setup is needed or even possible with unverified actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "An initial observation of whether ACTION5 has any visible effect, and if so, what that effect is. This will move it from 0 attempts to 1, providing the first piece of information for its definition.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board shows a general green background with some colored blocks and UI elements. There are no immediate features that suggest a specific setup is required for any of the unverified actions, especially for ACTION5 which has an unknown effect. Testing it now will establish a baseline observation."
