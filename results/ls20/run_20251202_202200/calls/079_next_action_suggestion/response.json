  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has zero attempts, making it the highest priority for initial testing. Although currently defined as having no visible change, it's crucial to confirm this with further tests. All other actions have had an initial attempt, but are not yet consistent or verified. Prioritizing ACTION5 aligns with the strategy of exploring untested actions first.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To gain initial observations for ACTION5 and see if it truly has no effect, or if an effect becomes visible with multiple attempts or in this specific game state.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state is neutral and does not seem to present any specific conditions that would hinder or specifically aid in testing ACTION5 based on its current 'no visible change' definition."
