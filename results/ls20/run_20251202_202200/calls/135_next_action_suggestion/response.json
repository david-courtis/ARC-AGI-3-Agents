  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been attempted yet. It has a '0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts' status. Testing this action is the highest priority to gather initial observations. The current game state does not seem to present any obvious blockers for testing any action, so no setup sequence is necessary.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get an initial observation for ACTION5, which will allow us to start defining its behavior or confirm if it has no observable effect. This will move it from '0/8 attempts' to '1/8 attempts'.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game board is in a neutral state, with various colored blocks and UI elements present. There are no critical conditions that inhibit the testing of any action at this moment."
