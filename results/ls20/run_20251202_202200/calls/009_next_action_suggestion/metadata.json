  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes color changes in specific blocks at (42,40) -> 3 to 9, and at (40,40) -> 3 to 12. It also causes a change in a top_ui pixel, likely a score or status indicator (15 to 3).\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to affect the display of pixels, specifically changing their color to a lighter green/black (color 3). The nature of the pattern created or removed is not yet clear, but it covers a significant area in the lower-right quadrant of the play area. It also changed a pixel in the top-left UI area.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 causes specific color swaps. Notably, it changes blocks of color 3 to color 12 and blocks of color 12 (and possibly 9) to color 3, especially in the lower-right area. It also seems to affect a UI element, changing color 15 to color 3.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 appears to cause a cyclical color swap for some pixels within the 'lower_right_playarea_block' (12 -> 3 and 3 -> 12), and it changes the color of the 'top_left_UI_pixel' from 15 to 3.\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - lower_right_playarea_block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - top_left_UI_pixel: Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - A single pixel of color 15 in the top-left of the UI area is replaced by color 3.\n  - A block of pixels in the lower-right playarea, previously colors 12 and 9, are now color 3.\n  - A block of pixels in the lower-right playarea, previously color 3, are now color 12.\n  - A single pixel in the top-left of the UI area, previously color 15, is now color 3.\n  - A block of pixels in the lower-right playarea, previously certain colors, undergo a color transformation. Some pixels that were color 12 are now color 3, and some pixels that were color 3 are now color 12.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely generic, with various colored blocks in the play area and a UI bar at the top. There's no specific indication that this state would be detrimental to testing ACTION5, as we have no prior knowledge of ACTION5's effects or prerequisites."
