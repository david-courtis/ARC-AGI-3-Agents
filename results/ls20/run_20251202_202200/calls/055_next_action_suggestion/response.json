  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet. It has 0/3 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts. Prioritizing actions with zero observations is crucial for systematic exploration.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We hope to get the first observation of ACTION5. This will tell us if it has a discernible effect, or if it indeed causes no visible change, which itself is important information.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic enough for testing ACTION5, as its prior definition suggests it might have no visible effect or be highly conditional. A clear board state is best for initial observations."
