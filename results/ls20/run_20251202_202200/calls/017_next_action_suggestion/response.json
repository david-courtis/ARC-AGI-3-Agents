  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been attempted yet. It has the highest priority because no observations have been made for it. Since it appears to cause no visible change, there is no specific state required to test it. We need to attempt it to confirm this hypothesis or discover any subtle changes.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm that ACTION5 causes no visible changes, or to identify any subtle changes that were previously missed due to 0 attempts. This will move us closer to verifying its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state is suitable for testing any action, as there are no specific conditions identified that would benefit or hinder the testing of any pending action. There are no verified actions to create a specific setup."
