  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been observed yet (0/8 attempts). Prioritizing actions with no observations is crucial for systematic exploration. All other actions have at least one observation, making ACTION5 the top priority for initial testing.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to gain the first observation of ACTION5's effect. This will allow us to form an initial hypothesis about what ACTION5 does, or confirm if it truly has no visible effect, as previously suspected.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and suitable for testing any action that doesn't have specific state dependencies identified yet. Since ACTION5 is unknown, this state is as good as any to get a first observation."
