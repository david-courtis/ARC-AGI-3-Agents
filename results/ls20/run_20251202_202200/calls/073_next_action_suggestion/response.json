  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet (0/8 attempts). It is a priority to observe every action at least once to ensure no effects are missed. The current game state doesn't impose any obvious restrictions for testing ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get an initial observation of what ACTION5 does, or confirm that it indeed has no observable effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and doesn't seem to present any specific conditions that would hinder or specifically aid the testing of ACTION5. There are no critical elements near boundaries, specific colors are present, and the UI elements are in a common state."
