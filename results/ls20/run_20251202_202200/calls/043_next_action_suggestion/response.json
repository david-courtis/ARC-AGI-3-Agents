  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been attempted at all yet (0/8 attempts). Prioritizing actions with zero observations is crucial for systematic exploration. While other actions have one attempt, focusing on a completely unexplored action first is the most efficient use of the next step.",
  "expected_information_gain": "This attempt will provide the first observation for ACTION5. It will help us understand if it has any effect at all, or if its effect is subtle or conditional.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state is generic and doesn't seem to present any specific obstacles or advantages for testing ACTION5, as its basic effect is unknown. This is a good neutral state for an initial test of a previously untried action."
