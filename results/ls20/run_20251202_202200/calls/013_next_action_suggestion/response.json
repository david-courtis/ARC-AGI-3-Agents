  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted even once. It is a high priority to get at least one observation for every action to begin understanding its potential effects. No setup is needed as the description suggests it currently causes no visible change, so any state is suitable for an initial test.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We will get a first observation for ACTION5, which will either confirm its 'no visible change' property or reveal an unknown effect. This is crucial for verifying or disproving the current understanding of ACTION5.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely symmetrical in the play area with a central structure and some elements in the corners. The UI at the top-left has a recurring color, and a score indicator is also present. This state has no obvious elements that would hinder the testing of an action described as having 'no visible change'."
