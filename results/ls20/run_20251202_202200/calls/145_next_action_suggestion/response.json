  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted at all. Testing it now will provide an initial observation, which is the highest priority for exploration. While the current board state might not be ideal for all actions, there's no clear indication that ACTION5 is state-dependent given its current definition as 'no visible change'. If it has no effect, then the current state doesn't matter. If it does, we'll get our first clue.",
  "expected_information_gain": "An initial observation of ACTION5's effect. This will allow us to form a preliminary hypothesis about its function (or lack thereof) and determine if it's truly a no-op, or if its effects are conditional or subtle.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows a mix of colors and shapes, with some UI elements. There are no obvious 'blockers' or specific features that would make any action untestable. Given the 'no visible change' description of ACTION5, the current board state is as good as any to get a baseline observation."
