  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been observed/attempted, and therefore has the highest priority for testing. All other actions have had at least one attempt. We need to attempt it to gather initial observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to gain initial observations for ACTION5, to determine if it has any visible effect, or if its effect is subtle/conditional. This will provide a baseline for understanding its functionality.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic, showing the default green background with some active elements. There is no specific state required or detrimental to testing ACTION5 at this point, as its effects are unknown."
