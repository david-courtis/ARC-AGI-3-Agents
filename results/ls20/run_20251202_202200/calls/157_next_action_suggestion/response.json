  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet. My primary goal is to observe every action at least once. Since no setup sequence is available or needed, my next step is to test this unobserved action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Observing the initial effect (or lack thereof) of ACTION5 will allow me to generate its first description and begin the process of understanding its function. This will help confirm or refute the hypothesis that ACTION5 causes no visible change.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state is generic and not specifically bad for testing any of the pending actions, especially since ACTION5's effect (or lack of effect) has yet to be observed in any context."
