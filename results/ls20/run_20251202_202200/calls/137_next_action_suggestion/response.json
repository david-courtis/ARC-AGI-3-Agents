  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet (0/8 attempts). To efficiently explore the game, we prioritize actions that have never been observed to gather initial data.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe any potential effect ACTION5 might have on the game state. This will provide the first observation for this action, helping us form an initial hypothesis of its effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and doesn't seem to bias towards or against any particular action given our current understanding. Therefore, no specific setup is needed for testing ACTION5."
