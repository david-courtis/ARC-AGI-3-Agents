  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet (0/8 attempts). Prioritizing unobserved actions is key to systematic exploration. Since there are no verified actions, a setup sequence is not possible.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get a first observation of what ACTION5 does, or to confirm if it has no observable effect under current conditions. This will help us determine if it's truly a 'no-op' or if its effects are conditional or subtle.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely green with a few colored sprites/blocks. The UI elements show some activity. There's nothing in the current state that would inherently prevent testing ACTION5, as its prior definition suggests it had 'no visible change', implying it might not be sensitive to specific board configurations in an obvious way yet."
