  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been attempted yet (0/8 attempts). Prioritizing actions with no prior observations is the most efficient way to gain new information. All other actions have at least one attempt.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the effects of ACTION5, which currently has no known impact. This test could reveal a subtle effect, confirm it has no effect, or begin to show a conditional effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely green, with a few colored pixels. Since ACTION5 is currently described as having 'no visible change' or being 'conditional', the current state is as good as any to test its initial functionality."
