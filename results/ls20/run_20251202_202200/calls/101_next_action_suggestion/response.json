  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has zero attempts, making it the highest priority for initial exploration. Trying it now will give us at least one observation to start building its knowledge base.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe any visible effect of ACTION5 on the game state. Since its current definition suggests no visible change, even a consistent 'no change' observation is valuable. This first attempt will either confirm its subtlety or reveal a new, previously unobserved effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and doesn't seem to favor or hinder the testing of any particular action, especially one whose effects are still largely unknown. Therefore, no setup is necessary."
