  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet (0/8 attempts). Prioritizing untested actions is crucial for comprehensive exploration. All other actions have had at least one attempt.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to gain initial observational data on ACTION5 to begin understanding its effects, or to confirm it has no immediate visible effect. This will allow us to start forming a hypothesis about its function.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state appears to be a typical game state without any specific conditions that would hinder testing ACTION5, as its previous definition suggested no visible changes or conditional effects."
