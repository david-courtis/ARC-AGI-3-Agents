  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been attempted yet. Actions with zero attempts have the highest priority for testing as per the exploration strategy. While previous attempts for other actions showed some effect, we need to gather initial data for ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe any visible effects of ACTION5 for the first time. This will help us begin to define its behavior and determine if it has any immediate, obvious impact on the game state or UI elements.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is neutral and seems suitable for testing any action. There are no specific conditions that would hinder or aid the observation of ACTION5's effect based on its current undefined state."
