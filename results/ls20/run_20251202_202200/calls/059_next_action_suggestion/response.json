  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet (0/8 attempts). It is critical to attempt unobserved actions to gather initial data points before making further decisions on actions that already have some observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We will gain the first observation of ACTION5. This will help us to determine if it has any observable effects or if its effect is conditional on other factors. This is a foundational step in understanding its function.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and does not present any obvious obstacles or advantages for testing ACTION5, as its effects are entirely unknown. Therefore, no setup sequence is required."
