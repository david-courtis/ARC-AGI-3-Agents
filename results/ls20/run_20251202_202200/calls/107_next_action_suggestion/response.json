  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet. Testing untested actions has the highest priority to gain initial observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get an initial observation of what ACTION5 does, or confirm that it indeed has no visible effect, as previously hypothesized in the 'ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS'. This will move it from 0/8 attempts to 1/8 attempts and provide the first step towards verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing any action, as no specific environmental conditions have been identified as necessary or detrimental for any of the pending actions. Additionally, the existing descriptions of the other actions indicate they cause changes across various parts of the screen, so a neutral starting state is perfectly fine for observing a new action."
