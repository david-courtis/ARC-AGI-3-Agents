  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet. It has 0/3 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts. It is a high priority to gather initial data on this action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe any visible effect of ACTION5 on the game state. This will provide the first data point for its definition and help determine if it truly causes no visible change, or if its effect is subtle or conditional.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and does not seem to present any specific conditions that would hinder or facilitate the testing of ACTION5, especially since its effect is currently undefined."
