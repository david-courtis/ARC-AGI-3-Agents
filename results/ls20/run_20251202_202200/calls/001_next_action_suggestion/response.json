  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "All actions are unknown, so we should start by testing the first available action, ACTION1. There is no need for a setup sequence as no actions have been verified yet, and there's no indication that the current state is bad for testing any initial action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the direct effect of ACTION1 on the game state, likely involving movement, interaction with an object, or a change in the environment.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game board shows a primary agent (yellow and black 'L' shape near the top center), possibly a target or interactive element (blue and purple square near the bottom right), and some smaller purple and black 'L' shapes (one near the bottom left, one smaller one above the blue/purple square). There are also some red dots at the top and green/orange squares at the top right, which could be indicators or score. The agent is in an open area, so an initial action won't be immediately blocked."
