  "interpretation": "The color of two blocks changed. Specifically, the block at (42,40) which was previously color 3 (green) and is now color 9 (dark gray/black) was affected and the block at (40,40) which was previously color 3 (green) and is now color 12 (yellow) was affected. There was also a single pixel changed in the top_ui which changed from color 15 to color 3.",
  "action_definition": "ACTION1 causes color changes in specific blocks at (42,40) -> 3 to 9, and at (40,40) -> 3 to 12. It also causes a change in a top_ui pixel, likely a score or status indicator (15 to 3).",
