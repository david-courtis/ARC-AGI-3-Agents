  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been attempted at all, making it the highest priority for initial testing. All other actions have had at least one attempt, so prioritizing the completely untested action is the most efficient exploration strategy.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION5 has any visible effect, or if it indeed causes no observable change as previously speculated. This will help us start to characterize its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and not particularly advantageous or disadvantageous for testing ACTION5, as its effects are unknown. No special setup is deemed necessary."
