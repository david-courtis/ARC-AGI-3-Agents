  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been observed even once, making it the highest priority for initial testing. All other actions have at least one observation, even if inconsistent. Getting the first observation for ACTION5 will help us determine if it has any effect at all or if it's truly a 'no-op'. None of the other actions have been verified, so a setup sequence is not possible.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get the first observation for ACTION5, which will allow us to start understanding its effects (or lack thereof). This is crucial for systematically validating all actions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely a green background with some scattered pixels and blocks. Given that ACTION5 is completely unobserved, any state is suitable for its initial test as we are simply trying to identify if it causes *any* change."
