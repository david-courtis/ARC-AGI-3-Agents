It also causes a change in a top_ui pixel, likely a score or status indicator (15 to 3).\n  ACTION2: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nNo environment knowledge yet.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

Since ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5 have no observations, picking any of them is a valid first step. We pick ACTION2 to begin exploring its effects. There is no specific setup required as we are just trying to observe its immediate impact.",
