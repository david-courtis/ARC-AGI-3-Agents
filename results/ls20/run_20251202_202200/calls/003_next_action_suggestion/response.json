  "reasoning": "New actions (those with no observations) have the highest priority for initial testing. Since ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5 have no observations, picking any of them is a valid first step. We pick ACTION2 to begin exploring its effects. There is no specific setup required as we are just trying to observe its immediate impact.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the initial effects of ACTION2, potentially identifying changes in pixel values, object movement, or score updates.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state appears to be a neutral starting point for testing a new action. There are no obvious obstructions or critical states that would prevent us from directly testing an action."
