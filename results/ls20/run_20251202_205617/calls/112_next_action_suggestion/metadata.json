  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: VERIFIED - ACTION1 causes a specific color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a specific color 9 rectangular block (8x6) to move upwards by 8 pixels. Additionally, it removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area at (1,52). This action may have no visible effect if the specific color 12 and color 9 blocks are not present at a specific coordinate or if the 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) is not present.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities. Reports of 'moves' are not reflected in actual coordinate changes upon closer inspection, indicating a lack of visible effect.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. It also moves certain elements of the `top_ui` one unit to the left. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, or it has no visible effect. The specific conditions for each outcome are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements. However, it only triggers in specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts, and otherwise has no visible effect.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3: 10 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5: 1 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9: 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 object: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 blocks: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 shapes: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 shapes: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 blocks in the top UI: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 blocks: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 block: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.\n  - ACTION1 can sometimes resolve in no visible changes to the game state.\n  - ACTION4 can sometimes have no visible effect.\n  - ACTION3 does not always affect `top_ui` elements, even when other affected blocks are present.\n  - The 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) in the top_ui is a consistent target for removal by ACTION1 whenever ACTION1 has a visible effect on the other blocks.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 is the least validated action (0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts). It also had a 'NO EFFECT' observation recently, but since the environment is a new state (due to other actions being taken), it's worth re-testing directly. There are also two color 12 8x2 blocks at (48,40) and (48,32) and two color 9 8x6 blocks at (50,40) and (50,32) which correlate with the objects mentioned in the definition of ACTION2, suggesting a potentially good test state. There are other color 12 and color 9 blocks specified in its definition as well, and there's a strong likelihood one or more of these are present and could be moved by the action.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Verify if ACTION2 truly has 'no effect' or if there's a subtle effect not yet observed. Potentially achieve the first consistent observation for ACTION2.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The board appears to have several blocks that are mentioned in the definitions of the pending actions, making it a good state for testing. Specifically, the presence of multiple color 12 and color 9 rectangular blocks makes it suitable for testing ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 related movements. However, since the last attempt of ACTION2 with no effect was not in the immediate preceding action, and the environment has changed, we don't necessarily need a setup sequence if we are prioritizing testing the least validated action first."
