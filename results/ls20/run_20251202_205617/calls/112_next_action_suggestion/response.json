  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 is the least validated action (0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts). It also had a 'NO EFFECT' observation recently, but since the environment is a new state (due to other actions being taken), it's worth re-testing directly. There are also two color 12 8x2 blocks at (48,40) and (48,32) and two color 9 8x6 blocks at (50,40) and (50,32) which correlate with the objects mentioned in the definition of ACTION2, suggesting a potentially good test state. There are other color 12 and color 9 blocks specified in its definition as well, and there's a strong likelihood one or more of these are present and could be moved by the action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify if ACTION2 truly has 'no effect' or if there's a subtle effect not yet observed. Potentially achieve the first consistent observation for ACTION2.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board appears to have several blocks that are mentioned in the definitions of the pending actions, making it a good state for testing. Specifically, the presence of multiple color 12 and color 9 rectangular blocks makes it suitable for testing ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 related movements. However, since the last attempt of ACTION2 with no effect was not in the immediate preceding action, and the environment has changed, we don't necessarily need a setup sequence if we are prioritizing testing the least validated action first."
