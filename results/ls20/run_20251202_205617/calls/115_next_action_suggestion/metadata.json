  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: VERIFIED - ACTION1 causes a specific color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a specific color 9 rectangular block (8x6) to move upwards by 8 pixels. Additionally, it removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area at (1,52). This action may have no visible effect if the specific color 12 and color 9 blocks are not present at a specific coordinate or if the 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) is not present.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level or automated object-level movement reports, no consistent, verifiable changes in object position, color, or presence are observed. Reports of 'moves' are not reflected in actual coordinate changes upon closer inspection, indicating a lack of visible effect.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. It also moves certain elements of the `top_ui` one unit to the left. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, or it has no visible effect. The specific conditions for each outcome are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements. However, it only triggers in specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts, and otherwise has no visible effect.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3: 10 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5: 1 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9: 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 object: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 blocks: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 shapes: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 shapes: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 blocks in the top UI: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 blocks: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 block: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.\n  - ACTION1 can sometimes resolve in no visible changes to the game state.\n  - ACTION4 can sometimes have no visible effect.\n  - ACTION3 does not always affect `top_ui` elements, even when other affected blocks are present.\n  - The 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) in the top_ui is a consistent target for removal by ACTION1 whenever ACTION1 has a visible effect on the other blocks.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 has only 1/3 consistent observations and 4/8 attempts, making it a priority for validation. It also had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, we need to move to a new state before retesting. ACTION1 is a verified action that causes specific blocks to move upwards and removes a `top_ui` element. Applying ACTION1 twice, moving the involved blocks upwards by 16 pixels, is a sufficient change in the game state to re-test ACTION4. The definition of ACTION4 involves blocks at specific coordinates (48, 32) and (50, 32) or (40, 32) and (42, 32) or (40, 40) and (42, 40) which are close to the current objects. By moving the existing (48,40) and (50,40) blocks, we increase the chances of hitting a context where ACTION4 might exhibit one of its right-moving or reset effects, especially since there are also objects at (48,32) and (50,32) which are possibly involved in this action.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By applying ACTION4 in a new state after moving the main blocks, we aim to get an effect rather than 'no effect'. This will help us understand the conditions under which ACTION4 causes the blocks to move right or triggers a full game state reset, moving us closer to its verification.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains two main blocks (Color 12 8x2 at (48, 40) and Color 9 8x6 at (50, 40)) and a 2x2 color 8 block in the top_ui at (1, 52). There are also objects mentioned in the definition of ACTION4 at specific coordinates like (48, 32) and (50, 32). This state is suitable for using ACTION1 as a setup and then re-evaluating ACTION4."
