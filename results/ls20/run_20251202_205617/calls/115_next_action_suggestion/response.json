  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has only 1/3 consistent observations and 4/8 attempts, making it a priority for validation. It also had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, we need to move to a new state before retesting. ACTION1 is a verified action that causes specific blocks to move upwards and removes a `top_ui` element. Applying ACTION1 twice, moving the involved blocks upwards by 16 pixels, is a sufficient change in the game state to re-test ACTION4. The definition of ACTION4 involves blocks at specific coordinates (48, 32) and (50, 32) or (40, 32) and (42, 32) or (40, 40) and (42, 40) which are close to the current objects. By moving the existing (48,40) and (50,40) blocks, we increase the chances of hitting a context where ACTION4 might exhibit one of its right-moving or reset effects, especially since there are also objects at (48,32) and (50,32) which are possibly involved in this action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By applying ACTION4 in a new state after moving the main blocks, we aim to get an effect rather than 'no effect'. This will help us understand the conditions under which ACTION4 causes the blocks to move right or triggers a full game state reset, moving us closer to its verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains two main blocks (Color 12 8x2 at (48, 40) and Color 9 8x6 at (50, 40)) and a 2x2 color 8 block in the top_ui at (1, 52). There are also objects mentioned in the definition of ACTION4 at specific coordinates like (48, 32) and (50, 32). This state is suitable for using ACTION1 as a setup and then re-evaluating ACTION4."
