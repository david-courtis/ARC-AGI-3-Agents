Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. It also removes one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The current game state includes various blocks of different colors and sizes, with two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) located towards the bottom right of the main play area.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one of color 12 and one of color 9, both located around (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively, moved upwards. There was also a single pixel change in the top UI bar, which is subtle and might indicate a score or timer update.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The current game state includes various blocks of different colors and sizes. Two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) are located towards the bottom right of the main play area. There are also three 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one of color 12 (8x2) and one of color 9 (8x6), both moved upwards by 8 pixels. The color 12 block moved from (48, 40) to (48, 32), and the color 9 block moved from (50, 40) to (50, 32). Additionally, a UI element in the top bar changed, specifically the color 8 2x2 block at (1, 52) disappeared.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, which decrements with this action (one block is removed).
  - The 'top_ui' element, represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, does not appear to decrement with this action, contradicting previous observations.
  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.
  - The 'top_ui' element does not consistently decrement with ACTION3.
  - The primary effect of ACTION3 is the leftward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks.
