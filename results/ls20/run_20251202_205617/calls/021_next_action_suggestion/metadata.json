  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. It also removes one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the observed Color 12 rectangular block and the Color 9 rectangular block one unit to the left, and decrements a counter in the `top_ui` by 1.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' element is a counter that decrements with this action.\n  - ACTION4 appears to move specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) to the right.\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, which decrements with this action (one block is removed).\n  - The 'top_ui' element, represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, does not appear to decrement with this action, contradicting previous observations.\n  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 has had two recent no-effect attempts. We must move to a new position before retesting it. Since no actions are yet verified for movement, we must use an action that has shown a consistent effect, even if not fully verified, to change the state. ACTION1 has shown a consistent effect in moving blocks, so we will use it as a setup. Then we will test ACTION2 again to see if its effect is context-dependent.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to determine if ACTION2's effect (or lack thereof) is dependent on the position of the blocks, or if it truly has no effect under any circumstances. This will help us clarify its definition and potentially verify its behavior.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is the same as when ACTION2 showed no effect recently, making it unsuitable for direct re-testing. Changing the position of the blocks using ACTION1 is necessary to get a different context for testing ACTION2."
