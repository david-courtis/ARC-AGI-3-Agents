  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has had two recent no-effect attempts. We must move to a new position before retesting it. Since no actions are yet verified for movement, we must use an action that has shown a consistent effect, even if not fully verified, to change the state. ACTION1 has shown a consistent effect in moving blocks, so we will use it as a setup. Then we will test ACTION2 again to see if its effect is context-dependent.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to determine if ACTION2's effect (or lack thereof) is dependent on the position of the blocks, or if it truly has no effect under any circumstances. This will help us clarify its definition and potentially verify its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is the same as when ACTION2 showed no effect recently, making it unsuitable for direct re-testing. Changing the position of the blocks using ACTION1 is necessary to get a different context for testing ACTION2."
