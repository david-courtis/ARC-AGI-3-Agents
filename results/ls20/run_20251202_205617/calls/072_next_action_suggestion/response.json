  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has only 2 attempts and needs to be tested further. The description states it moves Color 12 and Color 9 blocks to the left, and these blocks are present in the current state. ACTION2 and ACTION4 recently had 'no effect' and require a setup sequence. ACTION1 has had more attempts and is closer to verification. ACTION5 is a reset and less of a priority for incremental learning of specific block movements. Since ACTION3 did not have an effect in observation 4, but the description says it only works if the blocks are present, it implies the blocks were not present at that time. Given the blocks required for ACTION3 are currently visible at (48,40) and (50,40), this is a good state to test it.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further clarify the effect of ACTION3, ideally leading to its verification if it consistently moves the specified blocks to the left.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game state contains the 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' which are relevant for ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4. The top_ui elements are also present. This state seems suitable for testing actions that interact with these blocks."
