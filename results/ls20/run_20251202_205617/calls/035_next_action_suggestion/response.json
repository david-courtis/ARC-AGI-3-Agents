  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been attempted and thus has the highest priority for initial testing. However, it recently caused 'NO EFFECT'. To adhere to the critical rule of not re-testing a no-effect action in the same state, a setup sequence is required. ACTION3 is chosen as it reliably causes movement of the Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks (objects noted in the environment understanding), thereby changing the game state and making it a 'different position' for testing ACTION5. While ACTION3 is not 'verified', its effect on block movement is consistent across recent observations, making it suitable for a setup sequence aimed at state change. After executing ACTION3, ACTION5 will be tested to try and observe its effect from a new position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get the first observation for ACTION5, specifically understanding if it has any visual effects on the game environment when tested in a different position. This will move ACTION5 past its current '0/3 consistent' status.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various movable blocks. Several actions still need to be thoroughly tested and their effects verified. Specifically, the 'NO EFFECT' for ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION5 in recent attempts means they cannot be re-tested immediately without a state change. Current movable objects include the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively, which are affected by ACTION3 and ACTION4."
