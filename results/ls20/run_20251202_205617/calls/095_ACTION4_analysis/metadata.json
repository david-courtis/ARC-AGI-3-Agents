  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:\n\"ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, while clearing all previous objects.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (6 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: The game state contained a green background, a 'top_ui' counter, and numerous colored blocks of varying sizes and locations. After the action, the background was orange, and only two new blocks were present.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, the entire screen changed. The background color changed from green to orange. Almost all previous objects disappeared, including the 'top_ui' counter. Two new objects appeared: a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32). This is a dramatic change compared to previous observations for ACTION4.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: The game state contained a variety of objects, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40), as well as a 'top_ui' line of objects and blocks of various colors and shapes. The background was green.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, two specific blocks moved one unit to the right. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) previously at (40, 40) moved to (41, 40), and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) previously at (42, 40) moved to (43, 40). No other visible changes, such as 'top_ui' counter decrementing or a full state refresh, were observed. This is a new observed effect for ACTION4, which previously showed no effect or a full state refresh.\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The game state contained a variety of objects, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40), as well as a 'top_ui' line of objects and blocks of various colors and shapes. The background was green.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, two specific blocks moved one unit to the right. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) previously at (40, 40) moved to (41, 40), and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) previously at (42, 40) moved to (43, 40). No other visible changes, such as 'top_ui' counter decrementing or a full state refresh, were observed.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3: 10 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5: 1 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9: 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 object: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.\n  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.\n  - ACTION3 can also affect `top_ui` elements, specifically moving 2x2 color 8 blocks within it one unit to the left.\n  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.\n  - ACTION1 can sometimes resolve in no visible changes to the game state.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
