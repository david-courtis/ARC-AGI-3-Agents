Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, while clearing all previous objects."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (6 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game state contained a green background, a 'top_ui' counter, and numerous colored blocks of varying sizes and locations. After the action, the background was orange, and only two new blocks were present.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, the entire screen changed. The background color changed from green to orange. Almost all previous objects disappeared, including the 'top_ui' counter. Two new objects appeared: a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32). This is a dramatic change compared to previous observations for ACTION4.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game state contained a variety of objects, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40), as well as a 'top_ui' line of objects and blocks of various colors and shapes. The background was green.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, two specific blocks moved one unit to the right. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) previously at (40, 40) moved to (41, 40), and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) previously at (42, 40) moved to (43, 40). No other visible changes, such as 'top_ui' counter decrementing or a full state refresh, were observed. This is a new observed effect for ACTION4, which previously showed no effect or a full state refresh.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game state contained a variety of objects, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40), as well as a 'top_ui' line of objects and blocks of various colors and shapes. The background was green.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, two specific blocks moved one unit to the right. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) previously at (40, 40) moved to (41, 40), and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) previously at (42, 40) moved to (43, 40). No other visible changes, such as 'top_ui' counter decrementing or a full state refresh, were observed.

Recent Observations:
  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.
  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.
  - ACTION3 can also affect `top_ui` elements, specifically moving 2x2 color 8 blocks within it one unit to the left.
  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.
  - ACTION1 can sometimes resolve in no visible changes to the game state.
