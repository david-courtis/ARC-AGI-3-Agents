Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:
"ACTION3 moves the observed Color 12 rectangular block and the Color 9 rectangular block one unit to the left, and decrements a counter in the `top_ui` by 1."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: Two rectangular blocks were positioned near the bottom right of the play area. A UI element was present at the top.
      Interpretation: ACTION3 caused the Color 12 rectangular block and the Color 9 rectangular block to move one unit to the left. The `top_ui`, which appears to be a score or counter, decreased by 1.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - The 'top_ui' element is a counter that decrements with this action.
  - ACTION4 appears to move specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) to the right.
  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, which decrements with this action (one block is removed).
  - The 'top_ui' element, represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, does not appear to decrement with this action, contradicting previous observations.
  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.
