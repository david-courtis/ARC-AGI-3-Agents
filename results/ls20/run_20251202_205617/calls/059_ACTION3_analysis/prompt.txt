Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:
"ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. However, in this instance, no visible changes occurred."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: Two rectangular blocks were positioned near the bottom right of the play area. A UI element was present at the top.
      Interpretation: ACTION3 caused the Color 12 rectangular block and the Color 9 rectangular block to move one unit to the left. The `top_ui`, which appears to be a score or counter, decreased by 1.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: Two rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) were present in the play area. A `top_ui` element, made of 2x2 color 8 blocks, was also present.
      Interpretation: ACTION3 caused the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) to move one unit to the left. The `top_ui` element, composed of 2x2 color 8 blocks, did not change.
  [3] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: Multiple colored blocks and UI elements were present in the play area.
      Interpretation: ACTION3 caused no visible changes to any objects or the environment.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification. This observation is strongly reinforced by this instance.
  - The conditions for ACTION1's effect on the 'top_ui' are not yet understood.
  - ACTION4 does not always cause the specified effects. The conditions that determine whether it has an effect are still to be determined.
  - ACTION1 can cause a 2x2 color 8 block in the top_ui at (1,52) to disappear.
  - The movement of the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks is consistently upwards by 8 pixels when the action has an effect.
