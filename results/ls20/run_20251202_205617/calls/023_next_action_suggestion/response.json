  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 currently has 0/3 consistent observations and 1/8 attempts. It needs more validation. It did have an effect last time, so it's a good candidate to re-test in the current state to confirm its behavior. There are no verified actions to use for a setup sequence anyway. ACTION2 and ACTION5 had 'NO EFFECT' recently, so they must be preceded by a setup sequence. ACTION1 and ACTION4 have 1/3 consistent observations, but ACTION3 has fewer attempts, so it's a higher priority due to less data.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get a second consistent observation for ACTION3 regarding its effect on the Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks (moving one unit to the left) and the decrementing of the 'top_ui' counter.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state appears to be adequate for testing ACTION3, as there are no obvious impediments or context changes required based on its known effect. The relevant blocks and the 'top_ui' are present."
