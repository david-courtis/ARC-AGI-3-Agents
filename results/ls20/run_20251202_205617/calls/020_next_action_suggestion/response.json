  "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 had no effect in recent attempts and thus cannot be tested again without a change in the game state. Since we have no VERIFIED actions to move, we must use a PENDING action. ACTION3 has one consistent observation and has not been used in a setup sequence yet. Using ACTION3 will move the relevant blocks (Color 12 and Color 9) to a new position, allowing us to re-test ACTION5. ACTION1 has 1/3 consistent observations, and ACTION4 also has 1/3, but ACTION3's observed effect of moving blocks to the left seems like a good way to create a 'different' state. Randomly choosing to re-test the no-effect actions, ACTION5 is chosen over ACTION2. We want to validate what ACTION3 does and then check if ACTION5 works in the new state, as its effect may be context-dependent.",
  "expected_information_gain": "This will provide another data point for ACTION3 toward verification. It will also allow us to test ACTION5 again in a modified state, hopefully revealing its effect or further confirming it has no effect in this new context.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is unsuitable for re-testing ACTION2 or ACTION5 as they recently had 'no effect'. We need to move the relevant objects into a new position to see if their effects are context dependent. There are identifiable blocks (Color 12, Color 9) that are affected by ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4. ACTION3 moves these blocks to the left and decrements a counter in 'top_ui'."
