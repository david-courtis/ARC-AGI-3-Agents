  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. It also removes one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the observed Color 12 rectangular block and the Color 9 rectangular block one unit to the left, and decrements a counter in the `top_ui` by 1.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' element is a counter that decrements with this action.\n  - ACTION4 appears to move specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) to the right.\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, which decrements with this action (one block is removed).\n  - The 'top_ui' element, represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, does not appear to decrement with this action, contradicting previous observations.\n  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 had no effect in recent attempts and thus cannot be tested again without a change in the game state. Since we have no VERIFIED actions to move, we must use a PENDING action. ACTION3 has one consistent observation and has not been used in a setup sequence yet. Using ACTION3 will move the relevant blocks (Color 12 and Color 9) to a new position, allowing us to re-test ACTION5. ACTION1 has 1/3 consistent observations, and ACTION4 also has 1/3, but ACTION3's observed effect of moving blocks to the left seems like a good way to create a 'different' state. Randomly choosing to re-test the no-effect actions, ACTION5 is chosen over ACTION2. We want to validate what ACTION3 does and then check if ACTION5 works in the new state, as its effect may be context-dependent.",
    "expected_information_gain": "This will provide another data point for ACTION3 toward verification. It will also allow us to test ACTION5 again in a modified state, hopefully revealing its effect or further confirming it has no effect in this new context.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is unsuitable for re-testing ACTION2 or ACTION5 as they recently had 'no effect'. We need to move the relevant objects into a new position to see if their effects are context dependent. There are identifiable blocks (Color 12, Color 9) that are affected by ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4. ACTION3 moves these blocks to the left and decrements a counter in 'top_ui'."
