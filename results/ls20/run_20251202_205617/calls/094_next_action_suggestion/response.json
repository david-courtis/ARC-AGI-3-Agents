  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has 1/3 consistent observations and 4/8 attempts. It still needs more validation. One recent attempt of ACTION4 had an effect, thus it doesn't strictly need a setup sequence based on the 'no effect' rule. The current state contains the Color 12 and Color 9 blocks that ACTION4 is known to interact with, specifically at (40, 40) and (42, 40) for one variation and (48, 32) and (50, 32) for another. Testing ACTION4 again now could help to confirm its behavior regarding moving these blocks or trigger the state-refreshing effect, which is still inconsistent.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We want to gain more consistent observations for ACTION4 to verify if it either moves specific blocks or triggers a complete game state refresh. Consistent observations will help to understand the conditions under which each effect occurs.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains the relevant blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) at various positions that ACTION4 has been observed to interact with (e.g., (48, 32), (50, 32) and (40, 40), (42, 40)). There are also many other objects, including `top_ui` elements. There is no immediate reason to believe the current state is bad for testing ACTION4, as it has previously shown effects in similar states."
