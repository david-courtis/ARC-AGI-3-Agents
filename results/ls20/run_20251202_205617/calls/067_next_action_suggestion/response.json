  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has varying effects, including a complete game state refresh, which can lead to new environments or object configurations. It also has an effect of moving blocks to the right. Given its inconsistency with only 2/8 attempts, more validation is required. Since it has failed often, attempting it in this state may trigger one of its 'no effect' outcomes where it has cleared the screen before, or it can advance our understanding. Its 'no effect' attempts have not been consecutive (last observed effect in the recent history was an effect). There is no specific indication that the current state is bad for testing ACTION4, and it is a good candidate for further validation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe if ACTION4 causes a game state refresh again, or if it moves the blocks, or if it has no effect in this specific configuration. This will help us clarify the conditions under which its different outcomes occur and get closer to its verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state includes several objects on a green background. There is a top_ui element present. There are multiple rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) which are mentioned in ACTION4's definition. This state seems suitable to test ACTION4 without a setup sequence."
