  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:\n\"ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The game state includes a 'top_ui' element acting as a counter and various colored blocks in the play area. Two specific blocks, a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block, were positioned at (48, 32) and (50, 32) respectively, within the play area.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, the 'top_ui' element, which appears to be a counter, decremented by one. This is consistent with previous observations. In the play area, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32) both moved one unit to the right.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The primary effect of ACTION3 is the leftward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks.\n  - ACTION1 does not consistently cause the defined changes.\n  - The 'top_ui' elements are not always affected by ACTION1.\n  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification.\n  - ACTION2 consistently results in no visible changes to any game objects.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",

However, this observation suggests that these effects are conditional, or the action may fail to trigger under certain circumstances.
