Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game state includes a 'top_ui' element acting as a counter and various colored blocks in the play area. Two specific blocks, a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block, were positioned at (48, 32) and (50, 32) respectively, within the play area.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, the 'top_ui' element, which appears to be a counter, decremented by one. This is consistent with previous observations. In the play area, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32) both moved one unit to the right.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - The primary effect of ACTION3 is the leftward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks.
  - ACTION1 does not consistently cause the defined changes.
  - The 'top_ui' elements are not always affected by ACTION1.
  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification.
  - ACTION2 consistently results in no visible changes to any game objects.
