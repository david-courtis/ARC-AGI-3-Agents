It may also update a UI element.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the observed Color 12 rectangular block and the Color 9 rectangular block one unit to the left, and decrements a counter in the `top_ui` by 1.\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter that decrements with this action.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 and ACTION5 have no observations yet, making them the highest priority for initial exploration. We prioritize ACTION4 over ACTION5 arbitrarily. No setup sequence is needed as there's no indication the current state is bad for testing ACTION4, and we have no verified movements to use anyway.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of a completely new action (ACTION4) on the game state, objects, or UI.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows several objects, but none are directly blocking or influencing the execution of a new, unknown action. The blocks moved by ACTION1 and ACTION3 are in their current positions, and there's no immediate context that would make testing an arbitrary action problematic."
