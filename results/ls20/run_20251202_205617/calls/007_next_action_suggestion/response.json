  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 and ACTION5 have no observations yet, making them the highest priority for initial exploration. We prioritize ACTION4 over ACTION5 arbitrarily. No setup sequence is needed as there's no indication the current state is bad for testing ACTION4, and we have no verified movements to use anyway.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of a completely new action (ACTION4) on the game state, objects, or UI.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows several objects, but none are directly blocking or influencing the execution of a new, unknown action. The blocks moved by ACTION1 and ACTION3 are in their current positions, and there's no immediate context that would make testing an arbitrary action problematic."
