Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 is intended to cause two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels and to remove one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element. However, this action does not consistently produce these effects, and can sometimes result in no visible change."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The current game state includes various blocks of different colors and sizes, with two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) located towards the bottom right of the main play area.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one of color 12 and one of color 9, both located around (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively, moved upwards. There was also a single pixel change in the top UI bar, which is subtle and might indicate a score or timer update.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The current game state includes various blocks of different colors and sizes. Two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) are located towards the bottom right of the main play area. There are also three 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one of color 12 (8x2) and one of color 9 (8x6), both moved upwards by 8 pixels. The color 12 block moved from (48, 40) to (48, 32), and the color 9 block moved from (50, 40) to (50, 32). Additionally, a UI element in the top bar changed, specifically the color 8 2x2 block at (1, 52) disappeared.
  [3] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The current game state features various blocks including a color 12 8x2 block at (8,16), a color 9 8x6 block at (10,16), and three 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area (1,52), (1,56), and (1,60).
      Interpretation: No observable changes occurred at the pixel or object level when ACTION1 was taken in this instance. The game state remained identical before and after the action. The previous definition of ACTION1 states that it causes specific blocks to move and removes a UI element. This observation contradicts that definition.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION2 consistently results in no visible changes to any game objects.
  - ACTION4 does not always cause the 'top_ui' counter to decrement or the specified blocks to move. The conditions for its effect are not yet fully known.
  - ACTION3 does not always cause the specified blocks to move, nor does it consistently affect the `top_ui`.
  - The conditions under which ACTION3 has an effect are not yet fully understood.
  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification. This observation is strongly reinforced by this instance.

FRAME CHANGES:
Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-31], cols [8-40]
