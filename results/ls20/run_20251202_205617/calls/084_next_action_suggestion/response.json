  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has only been attempted once and led to a complete environmental reset. While it's not a 'movement' action in the traditional sense, it dramatically changes the state. Given its low attempt count and significant effect, it is a high priority to validate its behavior. The definition suggests it is a 'level change' action, and there's no indication it requires specific pre-conditions to have an effect beyond the initial state (which it clearly changed last time). There are no verified actions to create a 'better' state for testing ACTION5 specifically, as its effect seems to be a global reset.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get more consistent observations about ACTION5's behavior, particularly if it consistently leads to a complete environmental reset or if there are variations in the new environment it generates. This will help us verify its definition.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and doesn't seem to favor or hinder the testing of ACTION5, which appears to be a global state-changing action. We have several objects on the screen, which ACTION5 should remove if its definition holds true."
