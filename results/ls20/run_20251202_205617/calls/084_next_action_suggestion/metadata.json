  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 6/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2 color 12 and 8x6 color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area at (1,52). The initial coordinates of the moving blocks can vary. The removal of the 'top_ui' element occurs when the main blocks move.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities. This observation further confirms its lack of visible effect, as reported 'moves' are not reflected in actual coordinate changes.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. It also moves certain elements of the `top_ui` one unit to the left. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, while clearing all previous objects.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3: 10 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5: 1 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9: 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 object: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The background color is not static and can change as a result of actions.\n  - New types of geometric shapes (irregular shapes like Color 4 64x64 and Color 3 48x48) can appear.\n  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.\n  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.\n  - ACTION3 can also affect `top_ui` elements, specifically moving 2x2 color 8 blocks within it one unit to the left.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has only been attempted once and led to a complete environmental reset. While it's not a 'movement' action in the traditional sense, it dramatically changes the state. Given its low attempt count and significant effect, it is a high priority to validate its behavior. The definition suggests it is a 'level change' action, and there's no indication it requires specific pre-conditions to have an effect beyond the initial state (which it clearly changed last time). There are no verified actions to create a 'better' state for testing ACTION5 specifically, as its effect seems to be a global reset.",
    "expected_information_gain": "To get more consistent observations about ACTION5's behavior, particularly if it consistently leads to a complete environmental reset or if there are variations in the new environment it generates. This will help us verify its definition.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and doesn't seem to favor or hinder the testing of ACTION5, which appears to be a global state-changing action. We have several objects on the screen, which ACTION5 should remove if its definition holds true."
