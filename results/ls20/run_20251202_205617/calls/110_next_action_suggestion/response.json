  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has 0/3 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts, making it the highest priority for testing. However, it had no effect in the previous state. Therefore, a setup sequence is required. ACTION1 is a verified action that causes blocks to move upwards and removes a UI element, which will change the game state for testing ACTION2. The current board shows the specific color 12 and color 9 blocks present at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively, and the 2x2 color 8 block is at (1,52) in the top_ui. Therefore, ACTION1 is expected to have an effect and change the state for the retry of ACTION2.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get the first consistent observation for ACTION2, understanding its actual effect or confirming its null operation in a new state. This will move it closer to being verified or definitively classified as a null action.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state contains the blocks needed for ACTION1 to be effective (Color 12 at (48,40), Color 9 at (50,40), and 2x2 color 8 at (1,52)). The state is different enough to re-test the 'no-effect' actions after a successful ACTION1."
