Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards, typically by 8 pixels. The effect on the 'top_ui' element (removal of a 2x2 color 8 block) is inconsistent and may not occur every time ACTION1 is taken. The identified blocks for movement are not always at the same initial coordinates in each instance where the action occurs. The action also sometimes has no visible effect whatsoever.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes and 'moved' object alerts, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. However, in this instance, no visible changes occurred.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement by one and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect. The conditions under which it succeeds or fails are still unknown.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION3 does not always cause the specified blocks to move, nor does it consistently affect the `top_ui`.
  - The conditions under which ACTION3 has an effect are not yet fully understood.
  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification. This observation is strongly reinforced by this instance.
  - The conditions for ACTION1's effect on the 'top_ui' are not yet understood.
  - ACTION4 does not always cause the specified effects. The conditions that determine whether it has an effect are still to be determined.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
