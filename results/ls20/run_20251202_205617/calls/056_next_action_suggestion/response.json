  "target_action": "ACTION1",

  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has shown some effect in the past, and its last attempt had an effect, so we are not in a 'no effect' state for this action. We need to gather more data to understand the conditions under which it acts on the 'top_ui' and the specific blocks it moves. Since no actions are currently verified, we cannot use a setup sequence of verified actions. We prioritize actions that have shown some effect over those that have consistently shown no effect. The current state seems as good as any other to test ACTION1, especially since there are no verified setup actions available to change the state meaningfully.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe another instance of ACTION1's effect on the blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) and hopefully gain more insight into the conditions affecting the 'top_ui' element. Specifically, we want to see if the top_ui is affected and how the block's coordinates change.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state includes the objects known to be involved with ACTION1 (Color 12 8x2 block at (48, 40) and Color 9 8x6 block at (50, 40), and the top_ui). We are not against any walls or in a state that inherently prevents ACTION1 from having an effect based on current knowledge."
