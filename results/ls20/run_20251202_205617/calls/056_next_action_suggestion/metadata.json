  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards, typically by 8 pixels. The effect on the 'top_ui' element (removal of a 2x2 color 8 block) is inconsistent and may not occur every time ACTION1 is taken. The identified blocks for movement are not always at the same initial coordinates in each instance where the action occurs. The action also sometimes has no visible effect whatsoever.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes and 'moved' object alerts, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. However, in this instance, no visible changes occurred.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement by one and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect. The conditions under which it succeeds or fails are still unknown.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION3 does not always cause the specified blocks to move, nor does it consistently affect the `top_ui`.\n  - The conditions under which ACTION3 has an effect are not yet fully understood.\n  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification. This observation is strongly reinforced by this instance.\n  - The conditions for ACTION1's effect on the 'top_ui' are not yet understood.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause the specified effects. The conditions that determine whether it has an effect are still to be determined.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION1 has shown some effect in the past, and its last attempt had an effect, so we are not in a 'no effect' state for this action. We need to gather more data to understand the conditions under which it acts on the 'top_ui' and the specific blocks it moves. Since no actions are currently verified, we cannot use a setup sequence of verified actions. We prioritize actions that have shown some effect over those that have consistently shown no effect. The current state seems as good as any other to test ACTION1, especially since there are no verified setup actions available to change the state meaningfully.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe another instance of ACTION1's effect on the blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) and hopefully gain more insight into the conditions affecting the 'top_ui' element. Specifically, we want to see if the top_ui is affected and how the block's coordinates change.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state includes the objects known to be involved with ACTION1 (Color 12 8x2 block at (48, 40) and Color 9 8x6 block at (50, 40), and the top_ui). We are not against any walls or in a state that inherently prevents ACTION1 from having an effect based on current knowledge."
