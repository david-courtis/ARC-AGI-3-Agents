  "interpretation": "When ACTION2 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the game state. Although the frame changes highlight activity and 'MOVED' objects are reported, the 'before' and 'after' coordinates for these objects, specifically the 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)', are identical. This confirms that visually, no movement or change took place.",
  "action_definition": "ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes and 'moved' object alerts, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.",
