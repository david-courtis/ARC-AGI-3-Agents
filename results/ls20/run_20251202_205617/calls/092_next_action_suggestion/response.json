  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has only been attempted once and recently resulted in 'NO EFFECT'. However, its description mentions it 'only triggers in specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts'. The current state has no verified movement actions, so we cannot perform a setup sequence to change the position before retrying a NO EFFECT action. As we have no verified actions, the highest priority is to try an action that needs more validation and has the potential for a significant discovery like 'environmental reset or level change'. Since ACTION5 is the only one not tried more than once that had a NO EFFECT in the recent past, we will attempt it again directly as we have no other means to change state. If it fails again, then we must prioritize getting a setup action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe if the 'significant environmental reset or level change' described in ACTION5's definition occurs, or if the conditions for its execution become clearer. We want to understand the 'specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts' for its effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows various blocks and UI elements. The background is green. There are several blocks (Color 12 8x2, Color 9 8x6) which are common to many action definitions. The current state is dynamic, as demonstrated by the 'moves' of blocks in other actions. The current state has many objects, which are relevant to a potential 'environmental reset' of ACTION5."
