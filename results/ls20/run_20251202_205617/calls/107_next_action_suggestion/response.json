  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has 0/3 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts, making it the highest priority for exploration. It has also had 3 recent 'NO EFFECT' attempts, so we must move to a new state first. ACTION1 is the only fully VERIFIED action and causes an upward movement of the main blocks. Executing ACTION1 twice will ensure a significant change in the position of the blocks to prevent ACTION2 from having no effect again due to being in the same state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Testing ACTION2 in a new state, particularly after an upward movement, might reveal its true effect if it's dependent on block position or interaction with the edges of the playing field. We hope to get the first consistent observation for ACTION2.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state contains the primary blocks involved in most actions. Given the recent no-effect of ACTION2, it's crucial to change the block's position before retesting it. Moving them upwards using ACTION1 for setup will create a sufficiently different state."
