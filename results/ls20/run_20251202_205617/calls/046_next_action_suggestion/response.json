  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has 2/8 attempts and 0/3 consistent observations. It also had a consistent effect in the recent history (entry 6), which suggests it's a good candidate to get to 3 consistent observations. This action has not had a recent NO EFFECT result, so it can be tested directly without a setup sequence. It's crucial to verify its effect as it's the closest to being understood.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a consistent observation for ACTION3, moving it closer to being a verified action. This will help confirm its described effect of moving blocks one unit to the left and clarify the inconsistent effect on `top_ui`.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing ACTION3. There are no immediate obstacles blocking the action, or special conditions that must be met to apply it."
