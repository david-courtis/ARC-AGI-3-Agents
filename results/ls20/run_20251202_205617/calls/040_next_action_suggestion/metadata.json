  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 is intended to cause two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels and to remove one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element. However, this action does not consistently produce these effects, and can sometimes result in no visible change.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.\n  - The 'top_ui' element does not consistently decrement with ACTION3.\n  - The primary effect of ACTION3 is the leftward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks.\n  - ACTION1 does not consistently cause the defined changes.\n  - The 'top_ui' elements are not always affected by ACTION1.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "setup_sequence": [],
    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never shown an effect and has zero consistent observations. It also had a recent 'NO EFFECT' attempt, but since there are NO VERIFIED ACTIONS yet, a setup sequence to move to a new position is not possible. Therefore, the highest priority is to gather more observations for ACTION5 in its current context, hoping to uncover a subtle effect or condition that makes it work. Since it has only been attempted 0 times, it has the highest potential for new information.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get the first observation for ACTION5, potentially revealing its intended effect or confirming that it consistently has no visible effect, which would help us classify it as a null operation.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is neutral for testing ACTION5, as its effects are entirely unknown. There are no specific conditions that would make the current state particularly good or bad for this action given the lack of knowledge."
