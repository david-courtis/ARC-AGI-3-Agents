  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never shown an effect and has zero consistent observations. It also had a recent 'NO EFFECT' attempt, but since there are NO VERIFIED ACTIONS yet, a setup sequence to move to a new position is not possible. Therefore, the highest priority is to gather more observations for ACTION5 in its current context, hoping to uncover a subtle effect or condition that makes it work. Since it has only been attempted 0 times, it has the highest potential for new information.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get the first observation for ACTION5, potentially revealing its intended effect or confirming that it consistently has no visible effect, which would help us classify it as a null operation.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is neutral for testing ACTION5, as its effects are entirely unknown. There are no specific conditions that would make the current state particularly good or bad for this action given the lack of knowledge."
