  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has the fewest consistent observations (0/3) and the fewest attempts (1/8), making it the highest priority for exploration. While it had no effect recently, the 'no effect' definition for ACTION5 states that it 'only triggers in specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts, and otherwise has no visible effect.' This implies that a previous 'no effect' result does not mean the current state is bad for testing it again, as we are still trying to understand its trigger conditions. Testing it again without a setup sequence is a direct attempt to discover a new context. Additionally, there are no currently verified movement actions to use for a setup sequence, so we can't force a state change using verified actions. Therefore, directly attempting ACTION5 is the most efficient way to gather more data on its conditions, even with a recent 'no effect' outcome.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe ACTION5's significant environmental reset effect, or if it has 'no effect' again, gather more data points to help deduce the conditions under which it triggers. Specifically, we want to see if the current game state (presence and position of specific objects) is one of the 'yet-to-be-identified contexts' that allows ACTION5 to trigger.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains various blocks and UI elements. There are no obvious conditions that either suggest or prevent ACTION5 from triggering based on current knowledge. The presence of 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40)' among the objects, along with others, might be relevant for ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4, and potentially ACTION5's trigger. However, without a better understanding of ACTION5's trigger conditions, we assume any state could potentially be the correct context for it to trigger."
