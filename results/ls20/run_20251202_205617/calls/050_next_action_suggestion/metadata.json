  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 is intended to cause two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels and to remove one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element. However, this action does not consistently produce these effects, and can sometimes result in no visible change.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes and 'moved' object alerts, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. However, in this instance, no visible changes occurred.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 previously caused the 'top_ui' counter to decrement and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. However, this observation suggests that these effects are conditional, or the action may fail to trigger under certain circumstances. We need more data to understand the conditions under which it succeeds or fails.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 consistently results in no visible changes to any game objects.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause the 'top_ui' counter to decrement or the specified blocks to move. The conditions for its effect are not yet fully known.\n  - ACTION3 does not always cause the specified blocks to move, nor does it consistently affect the `top_ui`.\n  - The conditions under which ACTION3 has an effect are not yet fully understood.\n  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification. This observation is strongly reinforced by this instance.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never had an effect, and we need to validate it. Since it has consistently had 'NO EFFECT', we need to keep testing it in different contexts. However, according to the game rules, if an action had 'NO EFFECT' in the current state, we MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first. There are currently no 'VERIFIED ACTIONS' available, so we cannot construct a meaningful setup sequence. Therefore, the strategy is to test ACTION5 again, as it has the least amount of attempts among the unverified actions and no action can be consistently counted on to achieve an 'effect' and allow a setup sequence. It's the least explored action.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Further data on ACTION5's behavior, potentially revealing conditions under which it might have an effect or solidify its 'null operation' status. We are primarily looking for its first successful effect.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is somewhat static in terms of known active elements. All current actions, when they do have an effect, seem to target the same set of blocks. This state provides an opportunity to continue testing actions that have not yet been fully validated, specifically ACTION5, as it has not been explored at all."
