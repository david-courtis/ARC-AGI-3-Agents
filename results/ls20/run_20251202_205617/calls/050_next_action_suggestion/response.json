  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never had an effect, and we need to validate it. Since it has consistently had 'NO EFFECT', we need to keep testing it in different contexts. However, according to the game rules, if an action had 'NO EFFECT' in the current state, we MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first. There are currently no 'VERIFIED ACTIONS' available, so we cannot construct a meaningful setup sequence. Therefore, the strategy is to test ACTION5 again, as it has the least amount of attempts among the unverified actions and no action can be consistently counted on to achieve an 'effect' and allow a setup sequence. It's the least explored action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further data on ACTION5's behavior, potentially revealing conditions under which it might have an effect or solidify its 'null operation' status. We are primarily looking for its first successful effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is somewhat static in terms of known active elements. All current actions, when they do have an effect, seem to target the same set of blocks. This state provides an opportunity to continue testing actions that have not yet been fully validated, specifically ACTION5, as it has not been explored at all."
