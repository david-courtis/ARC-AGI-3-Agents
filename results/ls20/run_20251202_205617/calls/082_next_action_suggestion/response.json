  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not been observed with any consistent effect yet (0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts) and has three recent 'no effect' attempts. While the rule states to move to a new position after a 'no effect', it also prioritizes actions that have never been observed. The primary goal is to determine if ACTION2 ever has an effect. Since the current description suggests it's a null operation, we need to continue testing it in various contexts. There are no verified actions to use for a setup sequence. Given no verified movement actions, the most strategic choice is to test ACTION2 again to gather more data on its potential null effect or trigger a hidden effect. If it again has no effect, then the next step will be to prioritize establishing verified movement actions to escape a 'no effect' state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To determine if ACTION2 truly is a 'null' operation or if there are specific conditions under which it produces a visible effect. We need to reach 3 consistent observations to verify its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board currently has multiple objects present that are typically involved in other actions, specifically the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) as well as the 'top_ui' elements. This state is suitable for testing if ACTION2 interacts with these common game elements. The current state is sufficient to test ACTION2, especially given it is reported as having no effect. There's no specific 'bad' context for it because its effect (or lack thereof) is what we are trying to characterize."
