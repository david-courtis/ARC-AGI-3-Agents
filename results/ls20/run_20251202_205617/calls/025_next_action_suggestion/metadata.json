  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. It also removes one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, which decrements with this action (one block is removed).\n  - The 'top_ui' element, represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, does not appear to decrement with this action, contradicting previous observations.\n  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.\n  - The 'top_ui' element does not consistently decrement with ACTION3.\n  - The primary effect of ACTION3 is the leftward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 both had no effect in recent attempts from the current position. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to reach a different position before retesting them. Since none of the actions are fully 'verified' yet to be used freely in a setup sequence, we prioritize re-validating actions that are closest to full verification. ACTION1 has 1/3 consistent observations and has been recently successful, making it the most reliable choice for a setup move to change the state. After using ACTION1 to change the position, we will test ACTION2 first, as it has had more 'no effect' attempts recently and is therefore more urgent to re-evaluate in a fresh state.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION1, we expect to see the specific blocks move upwards and one of the 'top_ui' blocks removed as per previous observations. This will change the game state. After this, we will test ACTION2 again. We hope to either observe an effect from ACTION2 in this new state, or gather another 'no effect' observation which, in a different state, helps us understand if ACTION2 truly has no effect or if its effect is highly context-dependent. This will help us move ACTION2 towards verification.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current game state includes the blocks that are affected by ACTION1 and ACTION4, and the 'top_ui' element. There are also objects involved in ACTION3. The current state is not 'bad' for testing any specific action in terms of obvious conflicts, but given the recent 'no effect' outcomes for ACTION2 and ACTION5, it's critical to change the state before re-attempting them. ACTION1 is a reasonable choice to change the state meaningfully without excessive risk of an unknown outcome."
