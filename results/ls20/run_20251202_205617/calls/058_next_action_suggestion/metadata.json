  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui at (1,52). The action does not always have a visible effect, and the initial coordinates of the moving blocks can vary. The removal of the 'top_ui' element might not occur every time the other effects happen.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes and 'moved' object alerts, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. However, in this instance, no visible changes occurred.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement by one and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect. The conditions under which it succeeds or fails are still unknown.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification. This observation is strongly reinforced by this instance.\n  - The conditions for ACTION1's effect on the 'top_ui' are not yet understood.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause the specified effects. The conditions that determine whether it has an effect are still to be determined.\n  - ACTION1 can cause a 2x2 color 8 block in the top_ui at (1,52) to disappear.\n  - The movement of the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks is consistently upwards by 8 pixels when the action has an effect.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION3 has had no effect in 2 recent attempts. According to the rules, if an action had no effect, we MUST move first. However, no verified actions exist yet to use in a setup sequence. Therefore, before we can move, we must first verify other actions. ACTION3 currently has 0/3 consistent observations and 2/8 attempts, meaning it is still a high priority. Since there are no verified actions to move with, we cannot follow the 'move first' rule literally, so we must prioritize validating an action that we know *should* move something. The information about ACTION3 suggests it moves the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks to the left. Since no verified movement sequence is known, the best approach is to re-test the actions that are *expected* to cause movement in the current state to hopefully verify them. Since ACTION3 has seen no effect recently, and it's a movement action, it's a good candidate to retry in the current state to see if it finally *does* cause movement, which would then allow us to use it for setup sequences in the future. We're prioritizing validating a movement action to enable future state changes.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Further understand the conditions under which ACTION3 causes the blocks to move, and hopefully get a positive observation to contribute to its verification. Verifying ACTION3 as a movement action would provide a critical tool for future setup sequences.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks that are stated to be involved in ACTION3, and they are in a position where they can move left without immediately hitting a barrier."
