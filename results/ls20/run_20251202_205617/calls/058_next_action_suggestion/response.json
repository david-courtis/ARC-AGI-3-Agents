  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has had no effect in 2 recent attempts. According to the rules, if an action had no effect, we MUST move first. However, no verified actions exist yet to use in a setup sequence. Therefore, before we can move, we must first verify other actions. ACTION3 currently has 0/3 consistent observations and 2/8 attempts, meaning it is still a high priority. Since there are no verified actions to move with, we cannot follow the 'move first' rule literally, so we must prioritize validating an action that we know *should* move something. The information about ACTION3 suggests it moves the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks to the left. Since no verified movement sequence is known, the best approach is to re-test the actions that are *expected* to cause movement in the current state to hopefully verify them. Since ACTION3 has seen no effect recently, and it's a movement action, it's a good candidate to retry in the current state to see if it finally *does* cause movement, which would then allow us to use it for setup sequences in the future. We're prioritizing validating a movement action to enable future state changes.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further understand the conditions under which ACTION3 causes the blocks to move, and hopefully get a positive observation to contribute to its verification. Verifying ACTION3 as a movement action would provide a critical tool for future setup sequences.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks that are stated to be involved in ACTION3, and they are in a position where they can move left without immediately hitting a barrier."
