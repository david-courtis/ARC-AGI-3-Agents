  "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 both had no effect in recent attempts in the same state. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence of verified movement actions to reach a different position before re-testing. There are no verified actions yet, but ACTION1 has shown consistent effects twice. Therefore, ACTION1 is currently the best candidate for a 'setup' action to change the state. I'm choosing to try ACTION5 next in a new state because it has had fewer attempts than ACTION2. Using ACTION1 twice should sufficiently change the position of the movable blocks.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the game state with ACTION1 and then testing ACTION5, we hope to either observe an effect for ACTION5, or confirm that its lack of effect is not dependent on the previous state. This will help us determine if ACTION5 is truly a null operation or if its effects are conditional to specific game states not yet encountered.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, after two no-effect attempts with ACTION2 and one with ACTION5, is not ideal for re-testing these actions. We need to induce a significant change in object positions to rule out context-dependency for their observed lack of effect. ACTION1 reliably moves specified blocks, making it suitable for a setup sequence."
