Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2 color 12 and 8x6 color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area at (1,52) when the main blocks move. It's possible for ACTION1 to sometimes have no visible effect if the conditions for movement or removal are not met, or if the target objects are not present."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (9 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The current game state includes a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48,40), a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50,40), and 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area at (1,52) and (1,56).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) moved from (48,40) to (48,32), and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) moved from (50,40) to (50,32). A 2x2 color 8 block located at (1,52) in the top_ui disappeared.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The current game state includes a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,48), a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,48), and 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area at (1,52) and (1,56).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) moved from (24,48) to (24,40), and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) moved from (26,48) to (26,40). A 2x2 color 8 block located at (1,52) in the top_ui also disappeared.
  [3] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game state includes several color 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12 objects. Specifically, a color 12 8x2 block at (16,48), a color 9 8x6 block at (18,48), and 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area at (1,52) and (1,56).
      Interpretation: No visible changes occurred when ACTION1 was taken. The objects remain in their original positions and no objects appeared or disappeared.

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION3 can also affect `top_ui` elements, specifically moving 2x2 color 8 blocks within it one unit to the left.
  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.
  - ACTION1 can sometimes resolve in no visible changes to the game state.
  - ACTION4 can sometimes have no visible effect.
  - ACTION3 does not always affect `top_ui` elements, even when other affected blocks are present.
