  "reasoning": "ACTION4 recently caused a full-screen refresh and introduced new blocks. The current state has new blocks that fit the descriptions for other actions, but these are not 'verified' actions. ACTION5 has never had any effect and urgently needs testing. Though it has not been verified to move anything, trying it now in the new state is critical. There is no verified SETUP SEQUENCE at all, so we can't move to a 'different position' effectively. Therefore, we prioritize testing an unverified action (ACTION5) directly in this new state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We want to finally observe an effect for ACTION5, or get more consistent 'no effect' observations to verify it as a null operation. Even if it is a null operation, this is valuable information.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game state has been reset to a new configuration with a changed background color (orange) and two new objects (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32)). This new configuration might be favorable for actions that had no effect earlier, as the conditions might have changed."
