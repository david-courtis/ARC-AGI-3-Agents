Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui at (1,52). The action does not always have a visible effect, and the initial coordinates of the moving blocks can vary. The removal of the 'top_ui' element might not occur every time the other effects happen.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes and 'moved' object alerts, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement by one and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, while clearing all previous objects.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - The presence of the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appears to be a precondition for ACTION3 to have an effect.
  - ACTION4 can cause a complete reset or level transition, indicated by a screen clear and new objects appearing.
  - The 'top_ui' and previously observed moving blocks (Color 12 8x2 block at (48, 32) and Color 9 8x6 block at (50, 32)) are not involved in this new type of effect, as they were not present after the action in their previous form or location.
  - The game can undergo a significant state change, including background color and object population, triggered by an action.
  - New instances of 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' appeared, which might be related to the previously observed blocks in other effects, but at different locations and in a new context.
