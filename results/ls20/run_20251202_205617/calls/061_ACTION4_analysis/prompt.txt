Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 either causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement by one and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect. The conditions under which it succeeds or fails are still unknown."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game state includes a 'top_ui' element acting as a counter and various colored blocks in the play area. Two specific blocks, a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block, were positioned at (48, 32) and (50, 32) respectively, within the play area.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, the 'top_ui' element, which appears to be a counter, decremented by one. This is consistent with previous observations. In the play area, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32) both moved one unit to the right.
  [2] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game state contained various objects, including a 'top_ui' counter and several colored blocks. No specific blocks or counter were observed to change in this instance.
      Interpretation: ACTION4 was taken, but no visible changes were detected at the pixel or object level. This means the 'top_ui' counter did not decrement, and no blocks moved.
  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game state contained various objects, including a 'top_ui' counter and several colored blocks. No specific blocks or counter were observed to change in this instance.
      Interpretation: ACTION4 was taken, but no visible changes were detected at the pixel or object level. Neither the 'top_ui' counter decremented, nor did any blocks move. This is consistent with previous observations where ACTION4 sometimes has no effect.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - The conditions for ACTION1's effect on the 'top_ui' are not yet understood.
  - ACTION4 does not always cause the specified effects. The conditions that determine whether it has an effect are still to be determined.
  - ACTION1 can cause a 2x2 color 8 block in the top_ui at (1,52) to disappear.
  - The movement of the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks is consistently upwards by 8 pixels when the action has an effect.
  - The presence of the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appears to be a precondition for ACTION3 to have an effect.

FRAME CHANGES:
Total: 4084 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (784), upper_right_playarea (784), lower_left_playarea (784), lower_right_playarea (784), bottom_ui (256), top_ui (244), left_edge (224), right_edge (224) Changes in both play area and UI elements.
