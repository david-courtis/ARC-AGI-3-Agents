  "interpretation": "When ACTION4 was taken, the entire screen changed. The background color changed from green to orange. Almost all previous objects disappeared, including the 'top_ui' counter. Two new objects appeared: a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32). This is a dramatic change compared to previous observations for ACTION4.",
  "action_definition": "ACTION4 either causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement by one and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, while clearing all previous objects.",

    "New instances of 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' appeared, which might be related to the previously observed blocks in other effects, but at different locations and in a new context."
