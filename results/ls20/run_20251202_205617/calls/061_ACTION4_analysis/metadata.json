  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:\n\"ACTION4 either causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement by one and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect. The conditions under which it succeeds or fails are still unknown.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The game state includes a 'top_ui' element acting as a counter and various colored blocks in the play area. Two specific blocks, a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block, were positioned at (48, 32) and (50, 32) respectively, within the play area.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, the 'top_ui' element, which appears to be a counter, decremented by one. This is consistent with previous observations. In the play area, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32) both moved one unit to the right.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: The game state contained various objects, including a 'top_ui' counter and several colored blocks. No specific blocks or counter were observed to change in this instance.\n      Interpretation: ACTION4 was taken, but no visible changes were detected at the pixel or object level. This means the 'top_ui' counter did not decrement, and no blocks moved.\n  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The game state contained various objects, including a 'top_ui' counter and several colored blocks. No specific blocks or counter were observed to change in this instance.\n      Interpretation: ACTION4 was taken, but no visible changes were detected at the pixel or object level. Neither the 'top_ui' counter decremented, nor did any blocks move. This is consistent with previous observations where ACTION4 sometimes has no effect.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The conditions for ACTION1's effect on the 'top_ui' are not yet understood.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause the specified effects. The conditions that determine whether it has an effect are still to be determined.\n  - ACTION1 can cause a 2x2 color 8 block in the top_ui at (1,52) to disappear.\n  - The movement of the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks is consistently upwards by 8 pixels when the action has an effect.\n  - The presence of the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appears to be a precondition for ACTION3 to have an effect.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 4084 pixels changed.
