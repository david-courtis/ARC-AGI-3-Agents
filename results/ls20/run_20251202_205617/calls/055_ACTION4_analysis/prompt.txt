Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 previously caused the 'top_ui' counter to decrement and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. However, this observation suggests that these effects are conditional, or the action may fail to trigger under certain circumstances. We need more data to understand the conditions under which it succeeds or fails."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game state includes a 'top_ui' element acting as a counter and various colored blocks in the play area. Two specific blocks, a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block, were positioned at (48, 32) and (50, 32) respectively, within the play area.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, the 'top_ui' element, which appears to be a counter, decremented by one. This is consistent with previous observations. In the play area, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32) both moved one unit to the right.
  [2] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game state contained various objects, including a 'top_ui' counter and several colored blocks. No specific blocks or counter were observed to change in this instance.
      Interpretation: ACTION4 was taken, but no visible changes were detected at the pixel or object level. This means the 'top_ui' counter did not decrement, and no blocks moved.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION4 does not always cause the 'top_ui' counter to decrement or the specified blocks to move. The conditions for its effect are not yet fully known.
  - ACTION3 does not always cause the specified blocks to move, nor does it consistently affect the `top_ui`.
  - The conditions under which ACTION3 has an effect are not yet fully understood.
  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification. This observation is strongly reinforced by this instance.
  - The conditions for ACTION1's effect on the 'top_ui' are not yet understood.
