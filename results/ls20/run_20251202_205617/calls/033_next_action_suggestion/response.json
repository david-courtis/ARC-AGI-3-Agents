  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has 1 out of 3 consistent observations, meaning it's partially understood but not yet verified. It has not been observed as a 'no effect' action in recent history, making it a good candidate to test directly. The current state contains the objects that ACTION1 is known to affect, so it is a good state to test it in.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get another observation for ACTION1 to move towards its verification. Specifically, we want to confirm the consistent upward movement of the color 12 and color 9 blocks and the removal of one 2x2 color 8 block from 'top_ui'.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing ACTION1 as the relevant objects (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks, and 'top_ui') are present and in positions where their movement can be observed."
