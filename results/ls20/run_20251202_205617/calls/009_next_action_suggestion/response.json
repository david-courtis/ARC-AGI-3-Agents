  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has no observations yet, making it the highest priority for initial testing. Since no action is verified, we cannot use any actions for a setup sequence. The current state is as good as any to get an initial observation for ACTION5.",

  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is neutral for testing an unknown action, as there are no specific obstacles or interactable elements that would obviously block or enhance a general action."
