  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:\n\"ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards. It may also update a UI element.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT\n      Context: The current game state includes various blocks of different colors and sizes, with two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) located towards the bottom right of the main play area.\n      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one of color 12 and one of color 9, both located around (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively, moved upwards. There was also a single pixel change in the top UI bar, which is subtle and might indicate a score or timer update.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter that decrements with this action.\n  - The 'top_ui' element is a counter that decrements with this action.\n  - ACTION4 appears to move specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) to the right.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-55], cols [10-47]\n\nChanged pixels: (2,10): 15->3, (40,40): 3->12, (40,41): 3->12, (40,42): 3->12, (40,43): 3->12, (40,44): 3->12, (40,45): 3->12, (40,46): 3->12, (40,47): 3->12, (41,40): 3->12, (41,41): 3->12, (41,42): 3->12, (41,43): 3->12, (41,44): 3->12, (41,45): 3->12, (41,46): 3->12, (41,47): 3->12, (42,40): 3->9, (42,41): 3->9, (42,42): 3->9, (42,43): 3->9, (42,44): 3->9, (42,45): 3->9, (42,46): 3->9, (42,47): 3->9, (43,40): 3->9, (43,41): 3->9, (43,42): 3->9, (43,43): 3->9, (43,44): 3->9 ... and 99 more\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
