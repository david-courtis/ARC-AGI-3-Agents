  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, according to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before trying ACTION5 again. Since no actions are currently verified, we must choose an action that has shown some effect and is pending verification. ACTION1 has 2 consistent observations and is available. Executing ACTION1 will move the relevant blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) upwards, thus changing the game state. After this state change, we can re-attempt ACTION5 to see if its effect is context-dependent.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to determine if ACTION5 has a context-dependent effect. By testing it after a state change caused by ACTION1, we might observe an effect not seen previously, or confirm it truly has no visible effect across different states, bringing it closer to verification. We will also get another observation for ACTION1.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has the main moving blocks (Color 12 8x2 at (48, 40) and Color 9 8x6 at (50, 40)) in their initial positions. The 'top_ui' elements are present. This state has resulted in 'no effect' for ACTION2 and ACTION5 recently, indicating that those actions might be context-dependent or truly null operations. A state change is needed to further investigate these actions."
