  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has not been observed to have any effect in its previous attempt. However, since we have no verified actions, we cannot use a setup sequence to move to a new position. Therefore, we should try ACTION5 again as it is among the least tested actions. There is no information that the current state is bad for testing ACTION5. We need to distinguish if the action truly has no effect or if the effect is simply not visible in this game state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get a second observation for ACTION5, to further deduce if it is a null action or if its effects are not easily visible.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is neutral for testing ACTION5 as we have no information about its context-dependency."
