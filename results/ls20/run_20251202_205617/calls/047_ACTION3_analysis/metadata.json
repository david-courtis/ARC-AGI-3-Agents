  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:\n\"ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT\n      Context: Two rectangular blocks were positioned near the bottom right of the play area. A UI element was present at the top.\n      Interpretation: ACTION3 caused the Color 12 rectangular block and the Color 9 rectangular block to move one unit to the left. The `top_ui`, which appears to be a score or counter, decreased by 1.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: Two rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) were present in the play area. A `top_ui` element, made of 2x2 color 8 blocks, was also present.\n      Interpretation: ACTION3 caused the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) to move one unit to the left. The `top_ui` element, composed of 2x2 color 8 blocks, did not change.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION1 does not consistently cause the defined changes.\n  - The 'top_ui' elements are not always affected by ACTION1.\n  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification.\n  - ACTION2 consistently results in no visible changes to any game objects.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause the 'top_ui' counter to decrement or the specified blocks to move. The conditions for its effect are not yet fully known.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
