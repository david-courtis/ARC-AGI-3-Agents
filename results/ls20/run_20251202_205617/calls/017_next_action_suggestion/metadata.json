  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. It also removes one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the observed Color 12 rectangular block and the Color 9 rectangular block one unit to the left, and decrements a counter in the `top_ui` by 1.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' element is a counter that decrements with this action.\n  - ACTION4 appears to move specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) to the right.\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, which decrements with this action (one block is removed).\n  - The 'top_ui' element, represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, does not appear to decrement with this action, contradicting previous observations.\n  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 both had recent 'no effect' attempts. Since there are no currently verified actions, I must use pending actions that have shown a positive effect to create a setup sequence. ACTION1 and ACTION4 have both shown effects and moved objects. I will use ACTION1 and ACTION4 to create a new state, then test ACTION5, as it has had fewer no-effect attempts recently than ACTION2, making it a slightly higher priority to re-evaluate. By using a setup sequence of ACTION1 then ACTION4, I aim to significantly change the position of the movable blocks and hopefully, the object associated with ACTION5. This strategy aims to validate if the lack of effect was context-dependent.",
    "expected_information_gain": "To determine if ACTION5 has an effect when executed from a different game state, confirming if its previous 'no effect' was state-dependent or if it consistently has no visible effect. If an effect is observed, we can start forming a definition.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is not ideal for testing actions that previously had no effect. The movable blocks are in a known position where ACTION2 and ACTION5 didn't work. Applying new actions to change this state is necessary."
