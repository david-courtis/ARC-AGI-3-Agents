  "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 both had recent 'no effect' attempts. Since there are no currently verified actions, I must use pending actions that have shown a positive effect to create a setup sequence. ACTION1 and ACTION4 have both shown effects and moved objects. I will use ACTION1 and ACTION4 to create a new state, then test ACTION5, as it has had fewer no-effect attempts recently than ACTION2, making it a slightly higher priority to re-evaluate. By using a setup sequence of ACTION1 then ACTION4, I aim to significantly change the position of the movable blocks and hopefully, the object associated with ACTION5. This strategy aims to validate if the lack of effect was context-dependent.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To determine if ACTION5 has an effect when executed from a different game state, confirming if its previous 'no effect' was state-dependent or if it consistently has no visible effect. If an effect is observed, we can start forming a definition.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is not ideal for testing actions that previously had no effect. The movable blocks are in a known position where ACTION2 and ACTION5 didn't work. Applying new actions to change this state is necessary."
