  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 2/3 consistent, 7/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2 color 12 and 8x6 color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area at (1,52) when the main blocks move. It's possible for ACTION1 to sometimes have no visible effect if the conditions for movement or removal are not met, or if the target objects are not present.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities. This observation further confirms its lack of visible effect, as reported 'moves' are not reflected in actual coordinate changes.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. It also moves certain elements of the `top_ui` one unit to the left. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, or it has no visible effect. The specific conditions for each outcome are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements. However, it only triggers in specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts, and otherwise has no visible effect.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3: 10 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5: 1 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9: 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 object: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 blocks: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 shapes: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 shapes: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 blocks in the top UI: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 blocks: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 block: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.\n  - ACTION3 can also affect `top_ui` elements, specifically moving 2x2 color 8 blocks within it one unit to the left.\n  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.\n  - ACTION1 can sometimes resolve in no visible changes to the game state.\n  - ACTION4 can sometimes have no visible effect.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION3 has 0/3 consistent observations and 3/8 attempts. It has not had a no-effect attempt recently (last 10 actions), and one of its effects is to move objects to the left. The current state has multiple objects that could be affected by ACTION3. By testing ACTION3 in the current state, we aim to get more observations towards verifying its function.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe ACTION3's effect on the blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) and potentially on the top_ui elements, allowing us to get closer to 3 consistent observations and verify its behavior. Given its definition, it's a good candidate to test without much setup.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state contains several blocks (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)) and top_ui elements, which are all described as target objects for ACTION3. This makes the current state suitable for testing ACTION3 directly."
