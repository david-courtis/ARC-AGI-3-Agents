  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 is intended to cause two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels and to remove one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element. However, this action does not consistently produce these effects, and can sometimes result in no visible change.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.\n  - The 'top_ui' element does not consistently decrement with ACTION3.\n  - The primary effect of ACTION3 is the leftward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks.\n  - ACTION1 does not consistently cause the defined changes.\n  - The 'top_ui' elements are not always affected by ACTION1.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 has never produced any effect and still has 0/3 consistent observations. It needs to be tested in the current state, as we haven't seen it do anything yet, and cannot move since there are no verified movement actions. Repeated no-effect for ACTION1 and ACTION5 means we cannot test them in this exact state, and ACTION3/ACTION4 have already had some effects.",

    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing an action that has had no effects, as we cannot move to a 'better' state since no actions are verified."
