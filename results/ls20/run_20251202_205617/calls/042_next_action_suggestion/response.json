  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has never produced any effect and still has 0/3 consistent observations. It needs to be tested in the current state, as we haven't seen it do anything yet, and cannot move since there are no verified movement actions. Repeated no-effect for ACTION1 and ACTION5 means we cannot test them in this exact state, and ACTION3/ACTION4 have already had some effects.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To gather the first observation for ACTION2, and ideally gain some understanding of what it does, or at least confirm its 'no-effect' nature for future reference.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing an action that has had no effects, as we cannot move to a 'better' state since no actions are verified."
