  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been verified and has only had one consistent observation out of 4 successful attempts. While it had no effect in the last attempt, there are new objects that might trigger its other described effect (game state refresh with new blocks). Specifically, the two block types moved by ACTION1 are present at (48, 40) and (50, 40), which could be relevant to ACTION4 since its definition mentions those types of blocks moving to the right. Testing ACTION4 directly in this state allows us to see if the presence of these blocks at this position enables one of the described effects, especially the movement to the right, or if it triggers a complete game state refresh with new objects, which is another described outcome. Since ACTION4 has complex, context-dependent effects, it's crucial to test it under various conditions, including different object positions. There's no immediately obvious 'bad' state for testing ACTION4, as its effects can range from movement to a full reset.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to gain more insight into the conditions under which ACTION4 causes blocks to move right, or when it triggers a complete game state refresh. We are looking for another consistent observation of its effects, helping us clarify its conditions and move it towards verification. The presence of the specific 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' in the current state might illuminate its movement behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains instances of the 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' at (48, 40) and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' at (50, 40), which are relevant to ACTION1 and ACTION3, and also mentioned in the defintion for ACTION4 (either moving existing blocks or generating new ones). The 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) in the top_ui is also present. This state is suitable for testing ACTION4 to investigate if these objects influence its behavior, especially its block movement aspect, or if it continues to have no effect or triggers a game reset."
