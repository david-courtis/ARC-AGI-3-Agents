  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: VERIFIED - ACTION1 causes a specific color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a specific color 9 rectangular block (8x6) to move upwards by 8 pixels. Additionally, it removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area at (1,52). This action may have no visible effect if the specific color 12 and color 9 blocks are not present at a specific coordinate or if the 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) is not present.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level or automated object-level movement reports, no consistent, verifiable changes in object position, color, or presence are observed. Reports of 'moves' are not reflected in actual coordinate changes upon closer inspection, indicating a lack of visible effect.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. It also moves certain elements of the `top_ui` one unit to the left. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, or it has no visible effect. The specific conditions for each outcome are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements. However, it only triggers in specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts, and otherwise has no visible effect.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3: 10 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5: 1 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9: 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 object: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 blocks: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 shapes: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 shapes: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 blocks in the top UI: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 blocks: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 block: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.\n  - ACTION1 can sometimes resolve in no visible changes to the game state.\n  - ACTION4 can sometimes have no visible effect.\n  - ACTION3 does not always affect `top_ui` elements, even when other affected blocks are present.\n  - The 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) in the top_ui is a consistent target for removal by ACTION1 whenever ACTION1 has a visible effect on the other blocks.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been verified and has only had one consistent observation out of 4 successful attempts. While it had no effect in the last attempt, there are new objects that might trigger its other described effect (game state refresh with new blocks). Specifically, the two block types moved by ACTION1 are present at (48, 40) and (50, 40), which could be relevant to ACTION4 since its definition mentions those types of blocks moving to the right. Testing ACTION4 directly in this state allows us to see if the presence of these blocks at this position enables one of the described effects, especially the movement to the right, or if it triggers a complete game state refresh with new objects, which is another described outcome. Since ACTION4 has complex, context-dependent effects, it's crucial to test it under various conditions, including different object positions. There's no immediately obvious 'bad' state for testing ACTION4, as its effects can range from movement to a full reset.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to gain more insight into the conditions under which ACTION4 causes blocks to move right, or when it triggers a complete game state refresh. We are looking for another consistent observation of its effects, helping us clarify its conditions and move it towards verification. The presence of the specific 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' in the current state might illuminate its movement behavior.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains instances of the 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' at (48, 40) and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' at (50, 40), which are relevant to ACTION1 and ACTION3, and also mentioned in the defintion for ACTION4 (either moving existing blocks or generating new ones). The 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) in the top_ui is also present. This state is suitable for testing ACTION4 to investigate if these objects influence its behavior, especially its block movement aspect, or if it continues to have no effect or triggers a game reset."
