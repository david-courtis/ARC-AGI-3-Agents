Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: VERIFIED - ACTION1 causes a specific color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a specific color 9 rectangular block (8x6) to move upwards by 8 pixels. Additionally, it removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area at (1,52). This action may have no visible effect if the specific color 12 and color 9 blocks are not present at a specific coordinate or if the 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) is not present.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level or automated object-level movement reports, no consistent, verifiable changes in object position, color, or presence are observed. Reports of 'moves' are not reflected in actual coordinate changes upon closer inspection, indicating a lack of visible effect.
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. It also moves certain elements of the `top_ui` one unit to the left. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, or it has no visible effect. The specific conditions for each outcome are not yet fully understood.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements. However, it only triggers in specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts, and otherwise has no visible effect.

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.
  - ACTION1 can sometimes resolve in no visible changes to the game state.
  - ACTION4 can sometimes have no visible effect.
  - ACTION3 does not always affect `top_ui` elements, even when other affected blocks are present.
  - The 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) in the top_ui is a consistent target for removal by ACTION1 whenever ACTION1 has a visible effect on the other blocks.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5
