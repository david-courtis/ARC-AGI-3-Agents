Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards, typically by 8 pixels. The effect on the 'top_ui' element (removal of a 2x2 color 8 block) is inconsistent and may not occur every time ACTION1 is taken. The identified blocks for movement are not always at the same initial coordinates in each instance where the action occurs. The action also sometimes has no visible effect whatsoever."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (4 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The current game state includes various blocks of different colors and sizes. Two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) are located towards the bottom right of the main play area. There are also three 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one of color 12 (8x2) and one of color 9 (8x6), both moved upwards by 8 pixels. The color 12 block moved from (48, 40) to (48, 32), and the color 9 block moved from (50, 40) to (50, 32). Additionally, a UI element in the top bar changed, specifically the color 8 2x2 block at (1, 52) disappeared.
  [2] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The current game state features various blocks including a color 12 8x2 block at (8,16), a color 9 8x6 block at (10,16), and three 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area (1,52), (1,56), and (1,60).
      Interpretation: No observable changes occurred at the pixel or object level when ACTION1 was taken in this instance. The game state remained identical before and after the action. The previous definition of ACTION1 states that it causes specific blocks to move and removes a UI element. This observation contradicts that definition.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The current state includes a color 12 8x2 block at (24,8), a color 9 8x6 block at (26,8), and three 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area at (1,52), (1,56), and (1,60).
      Interpretation: In this observation, the color 12 8x2 block moved from (24,8) to (24,0), and the color 9 8x6 block moved from (26,8) to (26,0). No change was observed in the 'top_ui' element. This is still a movement upwards but does not involve the removal of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION3 does not always cause the specified blocks to move, nor does it consistently affect the `top_ui`.
  - The conditions under which ACTION3 has an effect are not yet fully understood.
  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification. This observation is strongly reinforced by this instance.
  - The conditions for ACTION1's effect on the 'top_ui' are not yet understood.
  - ACTION4 does not always cause the specified effects. The conditions that determine whether it has an effect are still to be determined.
