Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, or it has no visible effect. The specific conditions for each outcome are not yet fully understood."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (7 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game state contained a variety of objects, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40), as well as a 'top_ui' line of objects and blocks of various colors and shapes. The background was green.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, two specific blocks moved one unit to the right. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) previously at (40, 40) moved to (41, 40), and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) previously at (42, 40) moved to (43, 40). No other visible changes, such as 'top_ui' counter decrementing or a full state refresh, were observed. This is a new observed effect for ACTION4, which previously showed no effect or a full state refresh.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game state contained a variety of objects, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40), as well as a 'top_ui' line of objects and blocks of various colors and shapes. The background was green.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, two specific blocks moved one unit to the right. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) previously at (40, 40) moved to (41, 40), and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) previously at (42, 40) moved to (43, 40). No other visible changes, such as 'top_ui' counter decrementing or a full state refresh, were observed.
  [3] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game state contained a variety of objects, including multiple colored blocks of different sizes and shapes, and a 'top_ui' line of objects. The background was green.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, there was no visible change to any objects or the background. The state remained identical to the state before the action. This indicates that either ACTION4 had no effect in this specific context, or its effect is not always visible.

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.
  - ACTION1 can sometimes resolve in no visible changes to the game state.
  - ACTION4 can sometimes have no visible effect.
  - ACTION3 does not always affect `top_ui` elements, even when other affected blocks are present.
  - The 2x2 color 8 block at (1,52) in the top_ui is a consistent target for removal by ACTION1 whenever ACTION1 has a visible effect on the other blocks.
