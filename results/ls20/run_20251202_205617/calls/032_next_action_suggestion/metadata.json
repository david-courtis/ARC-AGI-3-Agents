  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. It also removes one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, which decrements with this action (one block is removed).\n  - The 'top_ui' element, represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, does not appear to decrement with this action, contradicting previous observations.\n  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.\n  - The 'top_ui' element does not consistently decrement with ACTION3.\n  - The primary effect of ACTION3 is the leftward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had a 'NO EFFECT' observation in the recent history, specifically, only 1 recent no-effect attempt. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different state before retesting it. Since no actions are currently 'verified', I will use the actions with the most consistent observations (ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4) to create a setup sequence that will likely alter the game state significantly. ACTION3 moves two blocks left, and ACTION4 moves them right while decrementing 'top_ui'. Using ACTION3 twice then ACTION4 once is expected to move the objects to a new position, allowing for a fresh test of ACTION5. ACTION2 also had recent no-effect attempts, but ACTION5 has been tested fewer times overall (0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts compared to ACTION2's 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts), making it a higher priority for general validation. The setup sequence aims to move game objects to a significantly different configuration to ensure the previous 'no effect' state is altered.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a setup sequence that significantly alters the game state, we hope to observe an effect previously unobserved. This could either reveal specific conditions under which ACTION5 operates or provide further evidence that ACTION5 consistently has no visible effect, irrespective of the game state, thus helping to verify its definition.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40). 'top_ui' is also present. This state has led to 'no effect' for ACTION2 and ACTION5 recently. A setup sequence is necessary to change the configuration of the blocks, particularly those involved in ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4. This change in state is crucial for retesting actions that previously showed no effect."
