  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not been observed to have any effect in 8 attempts. To properly test whether it truly has no effect or if it's context-dependent, we need to test it in a different game state. Since no actions are yet verified, we'll use actions that have shown effects (ACTION1 and ACTION4) to try and modify the game state significantly. We prioritize ACTION2 because it's had the most no-effect attempts, and we need to understand if it's truly a null operation soon.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to definitively determine if ACTION2 is indeed a null operation across different game states, or if its effect is highly context-dependent and we just haven't found the right context yet.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is complex, with various colored blocks and ui elements. Given that ACTION2 has consistently shown no effect in this and previous similar states, it's not a suitable state to retest ACTION2 directly. We need to alter the positions and presence of objects to properly re-evaluate ACTION2."
