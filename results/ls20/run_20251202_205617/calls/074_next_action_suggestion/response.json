  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not caused any visible effects in 8 attempts, and 3 of those were recent. However, the definition implies that its effects might not be 'visually represented' but could still exist at an 'object-level'. The current state has varied objects, including several mentioned in the 'ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING' as associated with ACTION2 (Color 12 8x2 block, Color 9 8x6 block, and several Color 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 objects). Since it's never had a visual effect, but also has no specific 'NO EFFECT' rule tied to a particular state, it's worth re-testing as we still have 0/3 consistent observations. Testing it again in the current state, which has a variety of objects, is a good way to try and observe any subtle object changes. If it continues to show no effect despite varied states, we can eventually verify it as a null operation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To determine if ACTION2 has any non-visual, object-level effects, or to gather more evidence it is a null operation. We want to see if any of the objects associated with ACTION2 change in any way, even if not visually obvious. This is crucial for verifying its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is good for testing ACTION2. It contains multiple objects, some of which are specifically mentioned in relation to ACTION2 from previous observations. There is also no explicit rule saying ACTION2 had no effect in *this specific* state. The presence of varied colored blocks and UI elements provides a rich environment to detect any potential subtle changes from ACTION2."
