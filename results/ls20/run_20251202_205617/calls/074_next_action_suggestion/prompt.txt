Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2 color 12 and 8x6 color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui at (1,52). The action does not always have a visible effect, and the initial coordinates of the moving blocks can vary. The removal of the 'top_ui' element occurs when the main blocks move.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite previous pixel-level change reports (now absent from detailed object analysis), object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities. This observation further confirms its lack of visible effect.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. It also moves certain elements of the `top_ui` one unit to the left. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, while clearing all previous objects.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements.

  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 3: 10 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 4: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 5: 1 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 8: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9: 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - The background color is not static and can change as a result of actions.
  - New types of geometric shapes (irregular shapes like Color 4 64x64 and Color 3 48x48) can appear.
  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.
  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.
  - ACTION3 can also affect `top_ui` elements, specifically moving 2x2 color 8 blocks within it one unit to the left.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
