  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not been observed consistently (0/3) and has 2 recent 'no effect' attempts. The rule states: 'If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first'. Since no actions are yet verified, we choose ACTION3 as a plausible movement action given its definition of moving blocks. By executing ACTION3, we ensure a change in the game state. After this change, we will test ACTION2 again to see if a different state reveals any effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe if ACTION2 has any effect in a different game state, thereby helping us understand its actual functionality or confirm it truly has no effect under varying conditions. We also hope to gather another observation for ACTION3 to further validate its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is not ideal for testing actions that had no effect, as repeating them in the same state is unlikely to yield new information. A movement action is needed to alter the state before re-testing."
