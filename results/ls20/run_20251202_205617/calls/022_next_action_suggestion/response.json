  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has been attempted 8 times with no effect, and has never been verified. It's crucial to test it from a different state. Since we have no VERIFIED actions, we have to use actions that have a high consistency count. ACTION1 has shown consistent effects (moving objects up and affecting the 'top_ui') and has 2 consistent observations, making it the most reliable for a setup sequence. Repeating ACTION1 three times will significantly alter the position of the movable blocks, ensuring a new state to test ACTION2. After moving to a new position, we re-test ACTION2 to see if its effect is context-dependent.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to determine if ACTION2 has any effect in a state where the movable blocks are significantly higher. This could reveal context-dependent behavior or help us understand if it's truly a 'no-op' action.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state has movable blocks at a specific position. We need to alter this position to properly test actions that previously had no effect."
