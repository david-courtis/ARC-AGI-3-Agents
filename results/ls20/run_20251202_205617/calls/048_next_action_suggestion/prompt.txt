Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 is intended to cause two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels and to remove one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element. However, this action does not consistently produce these effects, and can sometimes result in no visible change.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented. Object-level analysis consistently shows no change, even when pixel change data or 'moved' alerts suggest otherwise.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. However, in this instance, no visible changes occurred.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 previously caused the 'top_ui' counter to decrement and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. However, this observation suggests that these effects are conditional, or the action may fail to trigger under certain circumstances. We need more data to understand the conditions under which it succeeds or fails.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification.
  - ACTION2 consistently results in no visible changes to any game objects.
  - ACTION4 does not always cause the 'top_ui' counter to decrement or the specified blocks to move. The conditions for its effect are not yet fully known.
  - ACTION3 does not always cause the specified blocks to move, nor does it consistently affect the `top_ui`.
  - The conditions under which ACTION3 has an effect are not yet fully understood.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5
