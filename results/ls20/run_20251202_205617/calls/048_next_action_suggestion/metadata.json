  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 is intended to cause two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels and to remove one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element. However, this action does not consistently produce these effects, and can sometimes result in no visible change.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented. Object-level analysis consistently shows no change, even when pixel change data or 'moved' alerts suggest otherwise.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. However, in this instance, no visible changes occurred.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 previously caused the 'top_ui' counter to decrement and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. However, this observation suggests that these effects are conditional, or the action may fail to trigger under certain circumstances. We need more data to understand the conditions under which it succeeds or fails.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification.\n  - ACTION2 consistently results in no visible changes to any game objects.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause the 'top_ui' counter to decrement or the specified blocks to move. The conditions for its effect are not yet fully known.\n  - ACTION3 does not always cause the specified blocks to move, nor does it consistently affect the `top_ui`.\n  - The conditions under which ACTION3 has an effect are not yet fully understood.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION1 has 1 consistent observation but has recently resulted in a 'NO EFFECT'. According to the rules, if an action had no effect recently, we must use a setup sequence to move first. However, we do not have any VERIFIED actions yet to use for a setup sequence. Therefore, to make progress, we must test an action that has potential for effect and has not been tested in the current state since its last 'no effect'. ACTION1 had an effect earlier (3 actions ago) and more importantly, it is one of the actions with the most partial understanding (1/3 consistent observations). Since we cannot perform a setup sequence, our next best strategy is to test an action that has shown some effect in the past, in the hope of getting another consistent observation or understanding its conditions. Given that the key objects for ACTION1 (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) are present, it is reasonable to attempt it again. While ACTION3 also had an effect recently, it also resulted in 'NO EFFECT' in the immediate last attempt, making ACTION1 a slightly better choice as its previous effect was not immediately followed by a 'NO EFFECT' in the last 10 actions.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We hope to gain a consistent observation for ACTION1, bringing us closer to verifying it. We also aim to understand the conditions under which ACTION1 produces its defined effects or why it sometimes results in no visible change.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the objects relevant to ACTION1's description, namely the 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' (likely the ones at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively based on the description, though we need to confirm exact coordinates on screen) and the 'top_ui' element. There are no obvious immediate blockages or features that would prevent any action from occurring based on the description. Since we have no verified actions, we are essentially 'stuck' in this position and must try an action that has a chance of revealing new information or moving us to a new state."
