  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has only been attempted once and resulted in 'NO EFFECT'. The definition of ACTION5 states it 'only triggers in specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts'. Since we have no verified actions, we cannot perform a setup sequence to change the state. We must re-attempt ACTION5 in the current state to try and observe if the context has changed or if it truly is a no-op again. We need more attempts to understand its context or confirm it as a consistent 'no effect' action before prioritizing other partially verified actions. We cannot verify ACTION1 (2/3 consistent) or ACTION4 (1/3 consistent) by attempting them now, as the current state is unlikely to meet their conditions, and we are trying to resolve the actions with the least attempts first. ACTION2 has had several 'NO EFFECT' results, indicating it's likely a no-op, but we'll come back to this after trying to resolve actions that could be useful. ACTION3 has 0/3 consistent and 3/8 attempts, but ACTION5 has even fewer attempts (1/8).",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to either observe ACTION5's environmental reset/level change effect, providing critical information on its function and the conditions under which it triggers, or gather another 'NO EFFECT' observation, bringing us closer to understanding its consistency as a no-op in absence of specific triggers. This will help us identify the specific contexts required for ACTION5 to activate.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various objects, including some from the 'top_ui'. There are no clear indicators that would make ACTION5 trigger, but since we don't know the contexts yet, we need to try. The other actions (ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4) involve specific block movements, and without knowing how to manipulate the blocks into ideal positions, trying them might just lead to more `no effect` results or confuse our understanding of their effects given the current positions of the relevant blocks. ACTION2 is consistently showing no effect. Thus, ACTION5 is the most 'unknown' yet."
