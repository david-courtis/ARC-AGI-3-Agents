  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has never been observed and has not been attempted yet, making it a high priority for testing. However, it had no effect in previous attempts. Therefore, a setup sequence is required. Since we have no verified actions, we will use ACTION3 as it is the most consistent and well-understood action (causing leftward movement of the key blocks), to ensure a change in the game state before re-testing ACTION2. This will allow us to observe if ACTION2 has context-dependent effects.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to determine if ACTION2 has any visible effect when the game state is altered, particularly after objects have moved. This will help us understand if ACTION2 is truly a 'null' operation or if its effects are conditional.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely unknown regarding the conditions for various actions. Several actions have shown 'no effect' recently. It is crucial to vary the game state to find contextual triggers for these actions."
