  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 is intended to cause two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels and to remove one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element. However, this action does not consistently produce these effects, and can sometimes result in no visible change.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented. Object-level analysis consistently shows no change, even when pixel change data or 'moved' alerts suggest otherwise.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The primary effect of ACTION3 is the leftward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks.\n  - ACTION1 does not consistently cause the defined changes.\n  - The 'top_ui' elements are not always affected by ACTION1.\n  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification.\n  - ACTION2 consistently results in no visible changes to any game objects.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

  "response": {
    "target_action": "ACTION4",
    "setup_sequence": [],
    "reasoning": "ACTION4 has only one consistent observation out of one attempt, so it needs more validation. None of the recent actions that had no effect (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION5) are being re-attempted in the same state. ACTION4 also has a clear effect on 'top_ui' and block movement, making it a good candidate for quick verification if the effect is consistent.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get a second consistent observation for ACTION4 to move it closer to verification. Specifically, we want to confirm the decrement of the 'top_ui' counter and the rightward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks. We also want to see if the conditions for which blocks move become clearer.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, with the relevant Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks present, seems suitable for testing ACTION4's effects on block movement and the 'top_ui' counter. There are no obvious obstacles or conditions that would prevent ACTION4 from working as described. Since ACTION4 has not recently shown a 'no effect' result, no setup sequence is immediately required."
