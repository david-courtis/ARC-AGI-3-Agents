  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has only one consistent observation out of one attempt, so it needs more validation. None of the recent actions that had no effect (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION5) are being re-attempted in the same state. ACTION4 also has a clear effect on 'top_ui' and block movement, making it a good candidate for quick verification if the effect is consistent.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get a second consistent observation for ACTION4 to move it closer to verification. Specifically, we want to confirm the decrement of the 'top_ui' counter and the rightward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks. We also want to see if the conditions for which blocks move become clearer.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, with the relevant Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks present, seems suitable for testing ACTION4's effects on block movement and the 'top_ui' counter. There are no obvious obstacles or conditions that would prevent ACTION4 from working as described. Since ACTION4 has not recently shown a 'no effect' result, no setup sequence is immediately required."
