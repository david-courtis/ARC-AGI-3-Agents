  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 2/3 consistent, 7/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2 color 12 and 8x6 color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area at (1,52) when the main blocks move. It's possible for ACTION1 to sometimes have no visible effect if the conditions for movement or removal are not met, or if the target objects are not present.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities. Reports of 'moves' are not reflected in actual coordinate changes upon closer inspection, indicating a lack of visible effect.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. It also moves certain elements of the `top_ui` one unit to the left. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, or it has no visible effect. The specific conditions for each outcome are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements. However, it only triggers in specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts, and otherwise has no visible effect.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3: 10 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5: 1 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9: 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 object: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 blocks: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 shapes: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 shapes: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 blocks in the top UI: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 blocks: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 block: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION3 can also affect `top_ui` elements, specifically moving 2x2 color 8 blocks within it one unit to the left.\n  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.\n  - ACTION1 can sometimes resolve in no visible changes to the game state.\n  - ACTION4 can sometimes have no visible effect.\n  - ACTION3 does not always affect `top_ui` elements, even when other affected blocks are present.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION1 is currently at 2/3 consistent observations and has a recent 'no effect' attempt. However, according to the rule, 'If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again in the same state! Instead: Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position'. Since there are no verified actions yet, and the current image has the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40), which are the objects related to ACTION1, it's a good state to try to get a consistent observation, hoping to verify it. We are prioritizing actions that need more validation to reach 3 consistent observations. The most recent 'no effect' attempt for ACTION1 was because the objects had already moved to the top of the screen; in the current state, they are in the middle right of the screen, providing a different context for testing.",
    "expected_information_gain": "To gain the third consistent observation for ACTION1, verifying its behavior of causing two specific blocks to move upwards by 8 pixels and removing a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current state is favorable for testing ACTION1 as the relevant objects (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40)) are present and in a position where they can potentially move upwards, unlike the last 'no effect' attempt where they were already at the top."
