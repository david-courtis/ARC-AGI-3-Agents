  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. It also removes one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the observed Color 12 rectangular block and the Color 9 rectangular block one unit to the left, and decrements a counter in the `top_ui` by 1.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter that decrements with this action.\n  - The 'top_ui' element is a counter that decrements with this action.\n  - ACTION4 appears to move specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) to the right.\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, which decrements with this action (one block is removed).\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 both had no effect recently. Since there are no verified actions yet, we should prioritize moving to a new position to re-test them. ACTION4 is a good candidate for a setup sequence because it has shown an effect (decrementing counter and moving specific blocks) and has been observed once. By executing ACTION4, we will change the position of the movable blocks, providing a different state to test ACTION2. We prioritize ACTION2 over ACTION5 because it has had fewer attempts overall.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION4, we expect to move the relevant blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) to a new position. Then, by testing ACTION2 in this new state, we aim to discover if ACTION2 has a contextual effect that was not apparent in the previous state where it had no effect. This helps to determine if ACTION2 is truly a null operation or if its effects are conditional.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current state has movable blocks at (48, 40) and (50, 40). Both ACTION2 and ACTION5 had no effect in recent attempts in a similar state, so directly re-testing them here is unproductive. We need to alter the game state to properly re-evaluate these actions."
