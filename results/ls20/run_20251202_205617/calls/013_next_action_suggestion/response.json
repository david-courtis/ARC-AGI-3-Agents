  "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 both had no effect recently. Since there are no verified actions yet, we should prioritize moving to a new position to re-test them. ACTION4 is a good candidate for a setup sequence because it has shown an effect (decrementing counter and moving specific blocks) and has been observed once. By executing ACTION4, we will change the position of the movable blocks, providing a different state to test ACTION2. We prioritize ACTION2 over ACTION5 because it has had fewer attempts overall.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION4, we expect to move the relevant blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) to a new position. Then, by testing ACTION2 in this new state, we aim to discover if ACTION2 has a contextual effect that was not apparent in the previous state where it had no effect. This helps to determine if ACTION2 is truly a null operation or if its effects are conditional.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state has movable blocks at (48, 40) and (50, 40). Both ACTION2 and ACTION5 had no effect in recent attempts in a similar state, so directly re-testing them here is unproductive. We need to alter the game state to properly re-evaluate these actions."
