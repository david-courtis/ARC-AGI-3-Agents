  "interpretation": "When ACTION4 was taken, two specific blocks moved one unit to the right. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) previously at (40, 40) moved to (41, 40), and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) previously at (42, 40) moved to (43, 40). No other visible changes, such as 'top_ui' counter decrementing or a full state refresh, were observed. This is a new observed effect for ACTION4, which previously showed no effect or a full state refresh.",
  "action_definition": "ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, while clearing all previous objects.",
