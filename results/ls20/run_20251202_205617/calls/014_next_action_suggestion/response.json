  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not caused any visible changes in the past and is a high priority for further investigation. There is no verified SETUP sequence to change the game state right now. Since ACTION2 has never shown visible changes, it's possible its effect is internal and not state-dependent, or it requires a very specific state to activate. We should try it again in the current state to see if it now has an effect, since it shows 0/3 consistent observations. There hasn't been a recent 'no effect' attempt that would require a setup, so we can try it directly.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Determine if ACTION2 continues to have no visual effect or if an effect manifests under the current conditions. If it still has no effect, we will need to prioritize varying the game state more aggressively for this action in future turns.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state is as observed. There are no specific conditions that make this state 'bad' for testing ACTION2, particularly since its function is currently unknown. We are seeking to identify any effect, if one exists."
