  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui at (1,52). The action does not always have a visible effect, and the initial coordinates of the moving blocks can vary. The removal of the 'top_ui' element might not occur every time the other effects happen.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes and 'moved' object alerts, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement by one and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, while clearing all previous objects.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - New instances of 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' appeared, which might be related to the previously observed blocks in other effects, but at different locations and in a new context.\n  - ACTION5 is a game state transition action, leading to a new level or phase.\n  - The background color is not static and can change as a result of actions.\n  - New types of geometric shapes (irregular shapes like Color 4 64x64 and Color 3 48x48) can appear.\n  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 is the highest priority because it has zero consistent observations and zero attempts, making it completely unexplored. While it has recently shown 'NO EFFECT', its definition suggests it might be a null operation or have non-visual effects. Given the current state, if ACTION2 continues to show 'NO EFFECT', we will need to reconsider its nature or try it after a state change. However, due to its completely untested status, it warrants immediate testing. We do not need a setup sequence for ACTION2 yet, because we have never observed ANY effect from it, thus there isn't a state where it 'recently did nothing' that we need to change FROM.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to gain initial observations on ACTION2. We will look for any changes, visual or otherwise, to start building its definition. If it continues to show no visual effect, we will add more 'no effect' observations to its log and consider if there are other, non-visual ways it might be impacting the game state. This will help us clarify if it is truly a null operation or if its effects are simply subtle or contextual.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board features several blocks and a top UI. The background is predominantly green. The 'no effect' observations for other actions indicate that changes are often localized or tied to specific elements. Testing ACTION2 in this state is as good as any other until we have some initial observations."
