  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 is the highest priority because it has zero consistent observations and zero attempts, making it completely unexplored. While it has recently shown 'NO EFFECT', its definition suggests it might be a null operation or have non-visual effects. Given the current state, if ACTION2 continues to show 'NO EFFECT', we will need to reconsider its nature or try it after a state change. However, due to its completely untested status, it warrants immediate testing. We do not need a setup sequence for ACTION2 yet, because we have never observed ANY effect from it, thus there isn't a state where it 'recently did nothing' that we need to change FROM.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to gain initial observations on ACTION2. We will look for any changes, visual or otherwise, to start building its definition. If it continues to show no visual effect, we will add more 'no effect' observations to its log and consider if there are other, non-visual ways it might be impacting the game state. This will help us clarify if it is truly a null operation or if its effects are simply subtle or contextual.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board features several blocks and a top UI. The background is predominantly green. The 'no effect' observations for other actions indicate that changes are often localized or tied to specific elements. Testing ACTION2 in this state is as good as any other until we have some initial observations."
