  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has only had 1 attempt and was recently observed to have 'NO EFFECT'. However, its definition indicates it 'only triggers in specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts'. Since we have not yet identified these contexts, and it has only been attempted once with a 'NO EFFECT' outcome in the last 10 actions, it needs more validation. We are checking it in the current state to see if this is one of its 'specific contexts'. There are no verified actions to move to a 'different position' yet, so we cannot strategically position for ACTION5. We prioritize actions with fewer attempts and those recently showing 'NO EFFECT' (but not multiple times in a row without movement).",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe if the current game state aligns with the 'specific, yet-to-be-identified contexts' for ACTION5 to trigger its documented significant environmental reset or level change. If it still has no effect, we will know this state is not *that* context.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains various objects, including several color blocks and irregular shapes. There's a 'top_ui' element present. The background is green. This provides a clear state to observe any environmental reset or changes ACTION5 might introduce. No specific 'bad' conditions for ACTION5 are currently known."
