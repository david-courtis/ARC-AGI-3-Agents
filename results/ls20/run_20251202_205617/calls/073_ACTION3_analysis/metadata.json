  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:\n\"ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (4 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: Two rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) were present in the play area. A `top_ui` element, made of 2x2 color 8 blocks, was also present.\n      Interpretation: ACTION3 caused the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) to move one unit to the left. The `top_ui` element, composed of 2x2 color 8 blocks, did not change.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: Multiple colored blocks and UI elements were present in the play area.\n      Interpretation: ACTION3 caused no visible changes to any objects or the environment.\n  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Multiple colored blocks and UI elements were present in the play area. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) were not present.\n      Interpretation: No visible changes occurred to any objects or the environment when ACTION3 was taken. The two blocks previously identified as being moved by ACTION3 (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)) were not present in the scene.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3: 10 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5: 1 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9: 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 is a game state transition action, leading to a new level or phase.\n  - The background color is not static and can change as a result of actions.\n  - New types of geometric shapes (irregular shapes like Color 4 64x64 and Color 3 48x48) can appear.\n  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.\n  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed.
