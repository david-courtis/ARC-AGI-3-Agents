  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never shown any effect and has had two recent no-effect attempts from the current position. Thus, it is critical to test it in a new state. Since no actions are yet verified, we must use the best validated actions we have. ACTION1 is the most consistently observed action, with 2/3 consistent observations. Using it three times will significantly alter the position of the key blocks, allowing us to test ACTION5 under new conditions. This will help us determine if ACTION5 is truly a no-op or if its effects are conditional on the object positions. We prioritize ACTIONS with no observations and then actions that need more validation. Both ACTION2 and ACTION5 fall into this category. ACTION5 is chosen over ACTION2 as it has not been attempted as many times.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the environment significantly with ACTION1 and then testing ACTION5, we hope to disambiguate whether ACTION5 is a true no-op or if its effect is conditional on object positions. This will either bring us closer to verifying ACTION5 as having no effect or discover its hidden mechanics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state has the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40). These blocks are known to move with ACTION1. The 'top_ui' also has some 2x2 color 8 blocks. This state is not good for re-testing ACTION2 or ACTION5 due to recent no-effect observations. A change in object positions is necessary."
