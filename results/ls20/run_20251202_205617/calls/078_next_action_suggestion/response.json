  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has varying effects, sometimes moving blocks and sometimes causing a full state refresh. It has only 3 attempts and 0/3 consistent observations. One recent attempt had no effect, but another resulted in a full state refresh, and prior to that, it moved blocks. The current state has Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks present which are involved in its block-moving effect. Testing ACTION4 again without a setup sequence is justified because the last successful effect was a full state refresh, and there are currently objects on the board that ACTION4 has previously interacted with (movement). We need to clarify if it will cause a refresh or move the blocks.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify if ACTION4 consistently performs a state refresh, or if its block-moving effect or no-effect is context-dependent. This will help understand the conditions under which each of its described effects occurs, contributing to its consistency verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40), and similar blocks at (48,32) and (50,32) along with other diverse objects, and a top_ui. This state is suitable for testing ACTION4, as these objects are known to be affected by it."
