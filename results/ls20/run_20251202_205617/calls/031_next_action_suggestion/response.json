  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the last observation. According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first to a new position before retesting it. Since no actions are currently verified, I am using a sequence of pending actions that have shown some effect (ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4) to try and significantly alter the board state. This will maximize the chances of a new context for ACTION5. ACTION2 is also a 'no-effect' action, but ACTION5 has less data (0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts) and therefore needs more immediate attention. I choose a variety of actions in the setup sequence to ensure a diverse change in the game state, making it more likely that ACTION5 might reveal its behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a significant state change, we aim to discover if its 'no-effect' observation is state-dependent or if it truly has no visible effect across different states, thereby helping to verify its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has the Color 12 block (8x2) at (48, 40) and Color 9 block (8x6) at (50, 40). There's a 2x2 color 8 block as part of 'top_ui' at (1, 52). The state is not ideal for re-testing ACTION5, as it was the context where it previously had no effect. A change in the position of the key blocks or changes in the 'top_ui' could offer a new context for ACTION5 to potentially show an effect."
