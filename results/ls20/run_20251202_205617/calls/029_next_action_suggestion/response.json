  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, the critical rule dictates we must first use a setup sequence of verified movement actions to reach a different position before re-testing it. Since no actions are fully verified, I'm choosing ACTION1 because it has one consistent observation and has been successfully executed recently, suggesting it reliably moves the target blocks. Repeating it multiple times should sufficiently alter the game state. After moving, testing ACTION5 again will allow us to see if its effect is context-dependent or if it truly has no visible effect regardless of position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a significant state change, we aim to discover if ACTION5's effect is conditional on the game state or object positions. If it still has no effect, it strengthens the hypothesis that its effects are internal, invisible, or require a very specific, unobserved context. If it does show an effect, we will begin to understand its mechanics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is not suitable for re-testing ACTION5 due to its recent 'no effect' result. The presence of the Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks (involved in multiple actions) provides opportunities for movement. The 'top_ui' element is also present. The most strategic approach is to move these key objects to a new configuration before retrying ACTION5."
