  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui at (1,52). The action does not always have a visible effect, and the initial coordinates of the moving blocks can vary. The removal of the 'top_ui' element might not occur every time the other effects happen.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes and 'moved' object alerts, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement by one and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect. The conditions under which it succeeds or fails are still unknown.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The conditions for ACTION1's effect on the 'top_ui' are not yet understood.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause the specified effects. The conditions that determine whether it has an effect are still to be determined.\n  - ACTION1 can cause a 2x2 color 8 block in the top_ui at (1,52) to disappear.\n  - The movement of the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks is consistently upwards by 8 pixels when the action has an effect.\n  - The presence of the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appears to be a precondition for ACTION3 to have an effect.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 had no effect in its last two attempts. However, it previously had an effect causing the 'top_ui' counter to decrement and the specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The current state contains Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32), which were identified as being involved in ACTION4. Since these blocks are present, it implies a condition for ACTION4 to potentially have an effect. We will try ACTION4 directly without a setup sequence because the objects involved are in a 'meaningful' position for ACTION4.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe if ACTION4 has an effect (moving the blocks and/or decrementing the top_ui) or not. This will help us identify what specific conditions trigger its effect, especially given its inconsistent behavior. We are trying to push its consistency for the definition to eventually verify it.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The relevant blocks (Color 12 8x2 at (48, 32) and Color 9 8x6 at (50, 32)) for ACTION4 are present on the board. This state appears suitable for directly re-testing ACTION4 without a setup sequence, as there is nothing immediately hindering the action's potential effect, like being against a wall. The state also contains the 'top_ui' which is also involved in ACTION4."
