  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:\n\"ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2 color 12 and 8x6 color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area at (1,52). The initial coordinates of the moving blocks can vary. The removal of the 'top_ui' element occurs when the main blocks move.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (8 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: The current game state includes a color 12 8x2 block at (48,40), a color 9 8x6 block at (50,40), and 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area at (1,52) and (1,56).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) moved from (48,40) to (48,32), and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) moved from (50,40) to (50,32). A 2x2 color 8 block located at (1,52) in the top_ui disappeared.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The current game state includes a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48,40), a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50,40), and 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area at (1,52) and (1,56).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) moved from (48,40) to (48,32), and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) moved from (50,40) to (50,32). A 2x2 color 8 block located at (1,52) in the top_ui disappeared.\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The current game state includes a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,48), a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,48), and 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area at (1,52) and (1,56).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) moved from (24,48) to (24,40), and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) moved from (26,48) to (26,40). A 2x2 color 8 block located at (1,52) in the top_ui also disappeared.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3: 10 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5: 1 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8: 2 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9: 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 3 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 5 object: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 objects: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - New types of geometric shapes (irregular shapes like Color 4 64x64 and Color 3 48x48) can appear.\n  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.\n  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.\n  - ACTION3 can also affect `top_ui` elements, specifically moving 2x2 color 8 blocks within it one unit to the left.\n  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
