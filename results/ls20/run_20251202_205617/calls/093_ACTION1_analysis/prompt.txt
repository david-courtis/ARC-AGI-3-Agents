Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2 color 12 and 8x6 color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui area at (1,52). The initial coordinates of the moving blocks can vary. The removal of the 'top_ui' element occurs when the main blocks move."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (8 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The current game state includes a color 12 8x2 block at (48,40), a color 9 8x6 block at (50,40), and 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area at (1,52) and (1,56).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) moved from (48,40) to (48,32), and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) moved from (50,40) to (50,32). A 2x2 color 8 block located at (1,52) in the top_ui disappeared.

      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) moved from (48,40) to (48,32), and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) moved from (50,40) to (50,32). A 2x2 color 8 block located at (1,52) in the top_ui disappeared.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The current game state includes a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,48), a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,48), and 2x2 color 8 blocks in the top UI area at (1,52) and (1,56).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) moved from (24,48) to (24,40), and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) moved from (26,48) to (26,40). A 2x2 color 8 block located at (1,52) in the top_ui also disappeared.

Recent Observations:
  - New types of geometric shapes (irregular shapes like Color 4 64x64 and Color 3 48x48) can appear.
  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.
  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.
  - ACTION3 can also affect `top_ui` elements, specifically moving 2x2 color 8 blocks within it one unit to the left.
  - ACTION5 can have no visible effect under certain conditions, which are not yet fully understood.
