  "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 had no effect in the last observed state. It is crucial to test these actions in a new state. Since no actions are yet verified for movement, I will use ACTION3 as a setup action as it has shown a consistent movement effect (moving objects left and decrementing the top_ui counter). After moving to a new state with ACTION3, I will test ACTION5 because it has had fewer attempts to show an effect compared to ACTION2 (1 vs 2 no-effect attempts). This prioritizes actions with fewer total observations to gather a wider range of data.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a state change, we aim to discover if its effect is context-dependent or if it truly has no visible effect across different states. If it shows an effect, we gain information about its functionality. If it still shows no effect, it strengthens the hypothesis that it's a null action or affects an invisible state.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state includes two rectangular blocks (8x2 color 12 and 8x6 color 9) which are involved in several actions. The 'top_ui' element is also present and appears to be a counter. It is a suitable state for general action testing, but specifically, for actions that previously had no effect, a state change is required."
