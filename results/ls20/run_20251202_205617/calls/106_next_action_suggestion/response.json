  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has 0/3 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts, making it a high priority for testing. However, it had no effect in recent attempts. Therefore, we need to move the blocks to a new position before retesting. ACTION1 is a verified action that moves the relevant blocks upwards. Executing ACTION1 twice will sufficiently change their position, and also remove the 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui. This will allow for a fresh test of ACTION2 in a different state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get a consistent observation of ACTION2's effect. Specifically, we want to see if it truly has no effect or if there are subtle changes that were missed, or if it works in this new position. We're also checking if the 'no visible effect' definition for ACTION2 is context-dependent.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) which are affected by ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4, and involved in the current definition of ACTION2. The 2x2 color 8 block (top_ui) is also present. Several recent actions had no effect, suggesting that varying the game state is crucial for further exploration."
