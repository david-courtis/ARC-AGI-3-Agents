  "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 both had recent 'no effect' results. According to the rules, we must use a setup sequence to reach a different position before re-testing a 'no effect' action. Since we don't have any VERIFIED actions yet, we'll use actions that have shown a clear effect (ACTION1, ACTION3) to change the game state. ACTION1 moves objects up and removes a UI block. ACTION3 moves objects left and decrements a UI counter. This sequence should sufficiently alter the state. ACTION5 is chosen over ACTION2 for re-testing because ACTION2 has had two recent consecutive 'no effect' attempts, suggesting it might truly be a null operation or requires a very specific context not yet encountered. Since ACTION5 only had one recent 'no effect', it is more likely to yield new information upon re-testing in a new state. Furthermore, we need to gather more data points for ACTION5 as it has the fewest attempts after ACTION2.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By re-testing ACTION5 after a significant change in the game state, we hope to either observe an effect, leading to a new consistent observation, or confirm that it indeed has no visible effect, irrespective of the position of the movable blocks.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state has movable blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. The 'top_ui' elements are also present. This state has been tested by ACTION2 and ACTION5, yielding no effect. Therefore, it is critical to move to a new state before re-testing those actions."
