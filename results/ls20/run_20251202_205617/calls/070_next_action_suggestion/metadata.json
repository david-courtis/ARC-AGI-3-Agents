  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2 color 12 and 8x6 color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui at (1,52). The action does not always have a visible effect, and the initial coordinates of the moving blocks can vary. The removal of the 'top_ui' element occurs when the main blocks move.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite previous pixel-level change reports (now absent), object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, while clearing all previous objects.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 is a game state transition action, leading to a new level or phase.\n  - The background color is not static and can change as a result of actions.\n  - New types of geometric shapes (irregular shapes like Color 4 64x64 and Color 3 48x48) can appear.\n  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.\n  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 has significantly fewer attempts (0/8) compared to other actions and consistently shows no effect. Since no specific objects are associated with ACTION2, testing it without a setup sequence is reasonable to gain more data points in the current state. This will help determine if its 'no effect' definition is truly consistent or if there are subtle conditions under which it acts. We prioritize actions with the fewest attempts, especially those with minimal defined effects. Since ACTION2 has no defined effect, we do not need to move to a new position, as there is no 'bad' position to test it from.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Further validation of ACTION2's 'no effect' nature, or the discovery of any subtle, as-yet-undocumented effect. We are trying to find out if it's truly a null action.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various objects, and a complex interplay of colors and shapes is present. There are two 8x2 Color 12 blocks and two 8x6 Color 9 blocks, one pair at (48, 40) and another at (48, 32). There is also a top_ui element with a 2x2 Color 8 block at (1, 52). There are no obvious immediate obstacles for any action, nor are there any obvious 'interaction' points for new object-related actions. The current state is sufficient for re-testing a 'no-effect' action without a specific positional context."
