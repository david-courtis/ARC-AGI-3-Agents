  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has significantly fewer attempts (0/8) compared to other actions and consistently shows no effect. Since no specific objects are associated with ACTION2, testing it without a setup sequence is reasonable to gain more data points in the current state. This will help determine if its 'no effect' definition is truly consistent or if there are subtle conditions under which it acts. We prioritize actions with the fewest attempts, especially those with minimal defined effects. Since ACTION2 has no defined effect, we do not need to move to a new position, as there is no 'bad' position to test it from.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validation of ACTION2's 'no effect' nature, or the discovery of any subtle, as-yet-undocumented effect. We are trying to find out if it's truly a null action.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various objects, and a complex interplay of colors and shapes is present. There are two 8x2 Color 12 blocks and two 8x6 Color 9 blocks, one pair at (48, 40) and another at (48, 32). There is also a top_ui element with a 2x2 Color 8 block at (1, 52). There are no obvious immediate obstacles for any action, nor are there any obvious 'interaction' points for new object-related actions. The current state is sufficient for re-testing a 'no-effect' action without a specific positional context."
