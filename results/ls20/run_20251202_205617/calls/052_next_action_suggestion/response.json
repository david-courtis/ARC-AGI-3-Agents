  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "All actions have had recent 'no effect' attempts, meaning we cannot test them in the current state without a setup sequence using VERIFIED actions. However, we have no verified actions to use in a setup sequence. In this specific scenario, the best strategy is to prioritize actions closest to being verified or those with more observed effects, even if conditional. ACTION1 has 1/3 consistent observations and produced an effect when last tried. Since we cannot move, we must test an action that has shown an effect, even if conditional, in the hope of getting a consistent observation. Given no verified actions for setup, no other action can be strategically tested by moving to a 'better' state. ACTION1 is the closest to being verified and has shown effects. We test it again hoping to get a second consistent observation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We hope to gain further understanding of ACTION1's effects and conditions, potentially leading to its verification, or at least narrowing down the conditions under which it produces an effect. If it shows an effect, we get closer to verification. If no effect, we have further evidence that its conditions are not met.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely unknown in terms of what constitutes 'good' for testing specific actions, as most actions have highly conditional or inconsistent effects. There are no clear 'interactable' objects for actions like 'interact'. The critical constraint is the lack of verified movement actions, which prevents us from executing a setup sequence to change the position for testing actions that previously had 'no effect'. We must therefore test an action that has previously shown *some* effect, even if conditional, in the hope of making progress towards verification."
