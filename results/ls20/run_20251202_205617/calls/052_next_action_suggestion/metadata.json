  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 is intended to cause two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels and to remove one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element. However, this action does not consistently produce these effects, and can sometimes result in no visible change.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite pixel-level changes and 'moved' object alerts, object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. However, in this instance, no visible changes occurred.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 previously caused the 'top_ui' counter to decrement and specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. However, this observation suggests that these effects are conditional, or the action may fail to trigger under certain circumstances. We need more data to understand the conditions under which it succeeds or fails.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 consistently results in no visible changes to any game objects.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause the 'top_ui' counter to decrement or the specified blocks to move. The conditions for its effect are not yet fully known.\n  - ACTION3 does not always cause the specified blocks to move, nor does it consistently affect the `top_ui`.\n  - The conditions under which ACTION3 has an effect are not yet fully understood.\n  - The 'moved' category in frame changes does not always reflect actual object movement; it requires object-level verification. This observation is strongly reinforced by this instance.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "All actions have had recent 'no effect' attempts, meaning we cannot test them in the current state without a setup sequence using VERIFIED actions. However, we have no verified actions to use in a setup sequence. In this specific scenario, the best strategy is to prioritize actions closest to being verified or those with more observed effects, even if conditional. ACTION1 has 1/3 consistent observations and produced an effect when last tried. Since we cannot move, we must test an action that has shown an effect, even if conditional, in the hope of getting a consistent observation. Given no verified actions for setup, no other action can be strategically tested by moving to a 'better' state. ACTION1 is the closest to being verified and has shown effects. We test it again hoping to get a second consistent observation.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We hope to gain further understanding of ACTION1's effects and conditions, potentially leading to its verification, or at least narrowing down the conditions under which it produces an effect. If it shows an effect, we get closer to verification. If no effect, we have further evidence that its conditions are not met.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely unknown in terms of what constitutes 'good' for testing specific actions, as most actions have highly conditional or inconsistent effects. There are no clear 'interactable' objects for actions like 'interact'. The critical constraint is the lack of verified movement actions, which prevents us from executing a setup sequence to change the position for testing actions that previously had 'no effect'. We must therefore test an action that has previously shown *some* effect, even if conditional, in the hope of making progress towards verification."
