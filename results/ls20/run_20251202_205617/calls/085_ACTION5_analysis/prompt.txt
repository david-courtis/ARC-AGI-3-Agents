Analyze the effect of action ACTION5.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION5:
"ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (4 total):
  [1] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The environment consists of several shapes and blocks of various colors, including Color 3 48x48 shape, Color 4 64x64 shape, Color 5 8x8 shape, Color 8 2x2 blocks (likely top_ui elements), Color 9 blocks, and a Color 12 block. No specific objects appear to be highlighted or interactive in this particular frame.
      Interpretation: The action ACTION5 was executed, and no visible changes occurred in the environment at either the pixel or object level. This is consistent with the previous observation of ACTION5.
  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The environment contains various shapes and blocks of different colors. Specifically, there area Color 3 48x48 shape, a Color 4 64x64 shape and an 8x16 block, a Color 5 8x8 shape, several Color 8 2x2 blocks (likely top_ui elements), various Color 9 blocks, and a Color 12 8x2 block. No specific objects appear to be highlighted or interactive.
      Interpretation: The action ACTION5 was executed, and no visible changes occurred in the environment at either the pixel or object level.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: Prior to the action, the game screen had an orange background with a Color 12 8x2 block and a Color 9 8x6 block at the bottom right. After the action, the background changed to green, and a completely new set of objects appeared, including a large green irregular shape, smaller colored blocks, and a redesigned top UI.
      Interpretation: The action ACTION5 caused a complete transformation of the game state. The background color changed from yellow-orange to green. All previously observed objects (Color 12 8x2 block, Color 9 8x6 block) disappeared. Numerous new objects appeared, including various shapes and blocks of different colors, as well as a modified top_ui area with small colored pips.

Recent Observations:
  - The background color is not static and can change as a result of actions.
  - New types of geometric shapes (irregular shapes like Color 4 64x64 and Color 3 48x48) can appear.
  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.
  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.
  - ACTION3 can also affect `top_ui` elements, specifically moving 2x2 color 8 blocks within it one unit to the left.
