  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. It also removes one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, which decrements with this action (one block is removed).\n  - The 'top_ui' element, represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, does not appear to decrement with this action, contradicting previous observations.\n  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.\n  - The 'top_ui' element does not consistently decrement with ACTION3.\n  - The primary effect of ACTION3 is the leftward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 had no effect recently. We must perform a setup sequence to move to a different state before re-testing them. ACTION5 has had fewer attempts (0/8) and has never been observed compared to ACTION2 (0/8 attempts, but 2 recent 'no effects'). ACTION1 and ACTION3 are the most consistently observed actions, hence they are chosen for the setup sequence. Currently, there are no 'VERIFIED ACTIONS' yet, but ACTION1 and ACTION3 have 1/3 consistent observations and seem to reliably move blocks. A longer setup sequence (ACTION1 twice then ACTION3 twice) is chosen to ensure a significant change in the game state, making it less likely that ACTION5 will again have no effect due to the same context. After moving, we will test ACTION5 to gather initial observations.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get the first observation of ACTION5's effect. This will allow us to start defining its behavior and determine if it has any visual or state-changing effects in a different context. We need to know if it always has no effect, or if it is context-dependent.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the movable blocks at a specific position. There is a 'top_ui' which is known to be affected by some actions. The state is not ideal for re-testing actions that recently had no effect, as the context is unchanged. A setup sequence is necessary to alter the positions of the involved blocks and the configuration of the 'top_ui' to provide a new context for testing."
