  "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 had no effect recently. We must perform a setup sequence to move to a different state before re-testing them. ACTION5 has had fewer attempts (0/8) and has never been observed compared to ACTION2 (0/8 attempts, but 2 recent 'no effects'). ACTION1 and ACTION3 are the most consistently observed actions, hence they are chosen for the setup sequence. Currently, there are no 'VERIFIED ACTIONS' yet, but ACTION1 and ACTION3 have 1/3 consistent observations and seem to reliably move blocks. A longer setup sequence (ACTION1 twice then ACTION3 twice) is chosen to ensure a significant change in the game state, making it less likely that ACTION5 will again have no effect due to the same context. After moving, we will test ACTION5 to gather initial observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get the first observation of ACTION5's effect. This will allow us to start defining its behavior and determine if it has any visual or state-changing effects in a different context. We need to know if it always has no effect, or if it is context-dependent.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the movable blocks at a specific position. There is a 'top_ui' which is known to be affected by some actions. The state is not ideal for re-testing actions that recently had no effect, as the context is unchanged. A setup sequence is necessary to alter the positions of the involved blocks and the configuration of the 'top_ui' to provide a new context for testing."
