  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 is the action with the fewest attempts (0/8) and 0 consistent observations, making it the highest priority for exploration. While it had recent no-effects, the current state's objects (multiple color 12 and color 9 blocks, various color objects) are diverse and could potentially reveal a nuanced effect. Since it's never had a verified effect, we should prioritize observing it in various contexts. Retrying ACTION2 without a setup sequence is justified because its definition implies it might always have 'no visible effect', thus needing more direct testing to confirm this hypothesis rather than just varying the position hoping for a visible effect. The 'no effect' is also part of its observed behavior, not an indication of a wrong context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get more data points for ACTION2 to either confirm it is truly a null operation or to finally observe a consistent, visible effect that has been missed so far. This will help us move towards its 3/3 consistent observations.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board currently contains various objects that have been linked to other actions (ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5), including Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks. There are also many other color blocks and shapes present. This general diversity makes it a reasonable state to test ACTION2, considering its history of 'no visible effect' and our need to gather data on it."
