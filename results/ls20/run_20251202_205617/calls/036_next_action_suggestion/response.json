  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never shown an effect and has zero consistent observations, making it a high priority for further testing. Since ACTION5 recently had no effect, we must change the game state before retesting it. ACTION3 has shown consistent movement of specific blocks to the left, which will reliably alter the position of key game elements. This setup sequence will provide a new context to re-evaluate ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 in a new state (after the blocks have moved left due to ACTION3), we aim to discover if ACTION5's effect is conditional on object positioning. We want to see if it causes any visible changes or if its 'no-effect' status is state-independent.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has certain objects (Color 12 8x2 block, Color 9 8x6 block) in specific positions. Given that ACTION5 had no effect in this exact state recently, it's crucial to alter these positions to provide a different context for testing. The objects involved in ACTION3's movement are clearly present."
