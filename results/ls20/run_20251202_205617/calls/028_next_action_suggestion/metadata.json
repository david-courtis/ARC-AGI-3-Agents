  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2, color 12 and 8x6, color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. It also removes one of the 2x2 color 8 blocks from the 'top_ui' element.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 appears to be an action that does not cause any visible changes to the game state or objects. It may be a null operation or an action whose effect is not visually represented.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes the 'top_ui' counter to decrement. It also causes certain rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right. The specific conditions for which blocks move are not yet fully understood.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when executed in this observed state, does not result in any visible changes to objects or pixels. It is possible its effect is internal, on an invisible game state, or conditional on other factors not present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'top_ui' element appears to be a counter represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, which decrements with this action (one block is removed).\n  - The 'top_ui' element, represented by 2x2 color 8 blocks, does not appear to decrement with this action, contradicting previous observations.\n  - The objects noted as 'moved down' in the frame changes actually remained in their initial positions based on object-level comparison.\n  - The 'top_ui' element does not consistently decrement with ACTION3.\n  - The primary effect of ACTION3 is the leftward movement of the specified Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had 'no effect' recently (1 attempt) and thus cannot be tested in the same state. ACTION2 also had 'no effect' for 2 consecutive attempts. Therefore, a setup sequence is required. ACTION1 is the most 'verified' action (1/3 consistent observations) and has a clear, consistent effect (movement of specific blocks and decrement of top_ui) and it's not a no-effect action. By executing ACTION1 twice, we ensure a significant change in the game state, specifically moving the blocks upward and decrementing the top_ui twice. This change in state will provide a different context to re-test ACTION5, which is currently the least understood action with zero consistent observations. My goal is to validate ACTION5. After validating ACTION5, I would switch to ACTION2 or ACTION3. I expect that moving the blocks using ACTION1 will shift the game state and potentially reveal a condition for ACTION5 to have an effect. This strategy prioritizes actions with fewer observations or 'no effect' results, but only after changing the game state.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION5 after a significant state change (moving blocks up, decrementing top_ui), we hope to observe an effect of ACTION5. This would start to resolve the 'no effect' status and begin to understand its function. If it still has no effect, we gain further evidence that it may be a null operation or extremely context-dependent, pushing us towards testing it after different specific setup sequences in subsequent steps.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current state is not ideal for testing actions that previously had 'no effect'. There are no clear 'interactable' objects or specific conditions that indicate an action might now work. The primary moveable objects (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) are in their base positions, and the 'top_ui' has its initial number of blocks. It is a neutral state, making it suitable for a setup sequence that will alter object positions or values."
