  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (8x2 color 12 and 8x6 color 9) to move upwards by 8 pixels. The action also removes a 2x2 color 8 block from the top_ui at (1,52). The action does not always have a visible effect, and the initial coordinates of the moving blocks can vary. The removal of the 'top_ui' element occurs when the main blocks move.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 consistently appears to be a null operation or an action whose effects are not visually represented. Despite previous pixel-level change reports (now absent), object-level analysis consistently shows no change in position, color, or presence for any game entities.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) one unit to the left. The effect on `top_ui` is inconsistent across observations. This action only has an effect if the specified blocks are present in the play area.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes two specific rectangular blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) to move one unit to the right, or it has no visible effect, or it causes a complete refresh of the game state, changing the background color from green to orange and introducing two new blocks (Color 12 8x2 block and Color 9 8x6 block) at specific coordinates, while clearing all previous objects.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 triggers a significant environmental reset or level change. It clears the existing game screen, changes the background color, removes all current objects, and then populates the screen with a new set of objects and UI elements.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top_ui: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 2x2 block (color 8) at (1, 52) (top_ui): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - All objects present before the action: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - background_color: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 is a game state transition action, leading to a new level or phase.\n  - The background color is not static and can change as a result of actions.\n  - New types of geometric shapes (irregular shapes like Color 4 64x64 and Color 3 48x48) can appear.\n  - The 'top_ui' can be dynamically generated or changed, as indicated by the new small colored blocks forming a line at the top.\n  - The 2x2 block at (1, 52) (top_ui) is part of a series of such blocks, indicating a UI element that can be consumed or removed.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 has had 8 attempts with no effect and urgently needs more testing to determine if it is truly a null operation or if its effects are highly contextual. Since it needs to be tested in a new state, and ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4 are the actions that affect movement, a setup sequence is required. ACTION5 causes a complete reset and is not ideal for setting up movement. ACTION1 and ACTION4 are chosen because they have shown consistent movement effects and are likely to change the position of the blocks, providing a different context for testing ACTION2. Both actions have recently had effects, indicating they are likely to succeed in moving objects in the current state. The combination of ACTION1 (vertical movement) and ACTION4 (horizontal movement, or full screen reset) should sufficiently alter the state. ACTION3 could also move blocks, but it had no effect recently.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to either confirm that ACTION2 is a null operation across different states or identify specific conditions under which it produces an effect. By testing it after a setup sequence, we aim to eliminate the possibility that its lack of effect is solely due to the current state.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains several objects, including Color 12 rectangular blocks, Color 9 rectangular blocks, and top_ui elements. These objects are known to be affected by ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4. The current state is suitable for performing movement actions to change the context for subsequent action testing. There are visible blocks that correspond to the objects involved in ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4."
