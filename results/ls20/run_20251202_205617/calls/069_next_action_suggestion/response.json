  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has had 8 attempts with no effect and urgently needs more testing to determine if it is truly a null operation or if its effects are highly contextual. Since it needs to be tested in a new state, and ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4 are the actions that affect movement, a setup sequence is required. ACTION5 causes a complete reset and is not ideal for setting up movement. ACTION1 and ACTION4 are chosen because they have shown consistent movement effects and are likely to change the position of the blocks, providing a different context for testing ACTION2. Both actions have recently had effects, indicating they are likely to succeed in moving objects in the current state. The combination of ACTION1 (vertical movement) and ACTION4 (horizontal movement, or full screen reset) should sufficiently alter the state. ACTION3 could also move blocks, but it had no effect recently.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to either confirm that ACTION2 is a null operation across different states or identify specific conditions under which it produces an effect. By testing it after a setup sequence, we aim to eliminate the possibility that its lack of effect is solely due to the current state.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains several objects, including Color 12 rectangular blocks, Color 9 rectangular blocks, and top_ui elements. These objects are known to be affected by ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4. The current state is suitable for performing movement actions to change the context for subsequent action testing. There are visible blocks that correspond to the objects involved in ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4."
