  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in its previous attempts. According to the rules, we must move to a different position before re-attempting an action that recently had no effect. Since no actions are fully verified yet, we use a partially verified action for the setup. ACTION3 is chosen (moves left) to shift the controlled blocks to a new position, increasing the likelihood of a different context for ACTION5. Moving left might bring the block closer to other objects on the left side of the screen, which could potentially activate ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION5 in a new position, we hope to either observe a clear effect of the action or at least gather more data points regarding its conditions for activation. We are trying to understand its purpose and how to trigger it.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current controlled blocks (Color 12 at (48,40) and Color 9 at (50,40)) are in the center-right of the playing field. Many recent attempts of ACTION5 had no effect. This suggests the current position is not conducive to ACTION5's activation, or that there are no objects nearby for it to interact with from this position. Moving horizontally seems like a reasonable way to change the context for interaction."
