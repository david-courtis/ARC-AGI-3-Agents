Ample clear space surrounds them. No other specific changes immediately preceded this action. Other background elements and UI elements are present and remained unchanged.\n      Interpretation: The action ACTION5 had no visible effect on any objects or the general environment.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The scene contains a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32). Ample clear space surrounds them. No other specific changes immediately preceded this action.
