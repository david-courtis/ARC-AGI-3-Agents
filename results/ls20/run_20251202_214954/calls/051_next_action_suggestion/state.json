      "Discovered that movement can be in discrete units (e.g., '1 unit up').",
      "Confirmed that fixed objects (Block stack 1, Block stack 2, Block L-shape) act as walls or obstacles, as movement (ACTION5) was blocked, reinforcing their role as environmental barriers.",

      "Confirmed conclusively that 'Block stack 1', 'Block stack 2', and 'Block L-shape' objects are impassable walls/obstacles, as repeated attempts to move past them (ACTION5) consistently result in no change to the moving object's position. This reinforces their role as static environmental barriers.",
      "Confirmed that the fixed objects 'Block stack 1', 'Block stack 2', and 'Block L-shape' are definitively impassable barriers, as repeated movement attempts (ACTION5) consistently resulted in no change to the moving object's position, establishing their fundamental role as walls/obstacles in the environment.",

This reinforces their role as fundamental environmental barriers.",
      "Conclusive confirmation that the 'Block stack 1', 'Block stack 2', and 'Block L-shape' objects are fully impassable fixed walls or obstacles, as repeated attempts to move past them (e.g., ACTION5) show no change in the moving object's position, establishing their fundamental role as static environmental barriers.",
