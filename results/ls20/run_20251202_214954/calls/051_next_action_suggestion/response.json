  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in its past 8 attempts, meaning the current state is not conducive to observing its effects. To determine if ACTION5 has context-dependent behavior, we need to try it in a different position. Since ACTION4 moves the controlled blocks to the right, it is a suitable (though unverified) action to change the position for testing ACTION5. We've seen ACTION4 have an effect before, so it's a reasonable choice for a setup action to change state, and we need another observation of it to confirm its behavior anyway. We prioritize testing actions with zero consistent observations (ACTION5, ACTION2). Since ACTION5 had recent no-effects, it requires a position change. Therefore, we use ACTION4 to move, then test ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect from ACTION5 in a new position, potentially revealing its function. We also get another observation for ACTION4, to move it closer to verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current controlled blocks are located at (48,40) for Color 12 and (50,40) for Color 9. We have space to move right, so ACTION4 should move them. ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in the current (or similar) states, indicating a context-specific application."
