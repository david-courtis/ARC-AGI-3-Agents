Analyze the effect of action ACTION2.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION2:
"ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: Two rectangular blocks, previously at (40, 40) and (42, 40) respectively, are located in the lower right of the play area, with ample clear space below them. There are other objects and background elements present that were unaffected.
      Interpretation: Two blocks, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6), moved downwards by one unit. The color 12 block moved from row 40 to 41, and the color 9 block moved from row 42 to 43.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.
  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.
  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.
  - The 'controlled' objects are a group of two rectangular blocks, specifically a Color 12 (8x2) and a Color 9 (8x6) block, that move together.
  - ACTION1 moves these 'controlled' blocks up by one unit.
