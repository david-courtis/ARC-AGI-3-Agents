  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards. It also appears to cause a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear, potentially at the previous location of one of the moved main blocks, or as part of a 'drop' mechanism.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n  - The 'controlled' objects are a group of two rectangular blocks, specifically a Color 12 (8x2) and a Color 9 (8x6) block, that move together.\n  - ACTION1 moves these 'controlled' blocks up by one unit.\n  - ACTION2 not only moves the 'controlled' blocks down, but also causes a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear.\n  - The new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' appears at (32,32), which was the original top-left position of the Color 12 main block before it moved down.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in recent attempts (6 times in a row). According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying a no-effect action. Since no movement actions are fully verified, we should use an action with partial verification. ACTION3 has 1/3 consistent observations and moves objects to the left, which is a good way to vary the position. Moving twice left should ensure a significant enough change in position. After moving, we will reattempt ACTION5, as it is the most unknown action with 0/3 consistent observations and the highest priority to explore.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect of ACTION5 by testing it in a new position. This could reveal its true function, especially if it requires interaction with entities that might be present in a different location or if its effect is context-dependent. It could also reveal if its effect is very subtle or if it's truly a 'no-op' in most circumstances.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current controlled objects are in a central-right position. There are other objects scattered on the board. ACTION5 has shown no effect in this specific general area. It's crucial to move to a new area to test ACTION5 under potentially different conditions."
