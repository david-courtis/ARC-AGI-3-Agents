  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in recent attempts (6 times in a row). According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying a no-effect action. Since no movement actions are fully verified, we should use an action with partial verification. ACTION3 has 1/3 consistent observations and moves objects to the left, which is a good way to vary the position. Moving twice left should ensure a significant enough change in position. After moving, we will reattempt ACTION5, as it is the most unknown action with 0/3 consistent observations and the highest priority to explore.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect of ACTION5 by testing it in a new position. This could reveal its true function, especially if it requires interaction with entities that might be present in a different location or if its effect is context-dependent. It could also reveal if its effect is very subtle or if it's truly a 'no-op' in most circumstances.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current controlled objects are in a central-right position. There are other objects scattered on the board. ACTION5 has shown no effect in this specific general area. It's crucial to move to a new area to test ACTION5 under potentially different conditions."
