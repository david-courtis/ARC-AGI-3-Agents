- Objects are constrained by the boundaries of the darker green play area. Although not observed stopping at the boundary, this is a strong hypothesis.
- Movement appears to be in discrete units (e.g., 'moved up by one unit').
- Objects are constrained by the boundaries of the darker green play area.
- Internal walls/fixed objects (Block stack 1, Block stack 2, Block L-shape) impede movement, as ACTION5 had no effect.
