  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n  - The 'controlled' objects are a group of two rectangular blocks, specifically a Color 12 (8x2) and a Color 9 (8x6) block, that move together.\n  - ACTION1 moves these 'controlled' blocks up by one unit.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced 'NO EFFECT' in its last 3 attempts. Per the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to reach a *DIFFERENT* position before retesting an action that previously had no effect. Since ACTION4 is a movement action with 1 consistent observation, it's a suitable candidate to change the state. Moving right will change the position of the controlled blocks, potentially creating a new context where ACTION5 might have an effect.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect from ACTION5 in a new game state. This will allow us to start building a definition for ACTION5, or at least gather more data towards verification. If it still has no effect, we will know that its conditions are not met by simply moving right.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The 'controlled' blocks are currently at a specific position. The game state is ripe for testing an action that previously showed no effect, provided we first change the position of the controlled blocks."
