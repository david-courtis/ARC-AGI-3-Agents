  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced 'NO EFFECT' in its last 3 attempts. Per the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to reach a *DIFFERENT* position before retesting an action that previously had no effect. Since ACTION4 is a movement action with 1 consistent observation, it's a suitable candidate to change the state. Moving right will change the position of the controlled blocks, potentially creating a new context where ACTION5 might have an effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect from ACTION5 in a new game state. This will allow us to start building a definition for ACTION5, or at least gather more data towards verification. If it still has no effect, we will know that its conditions are not met by simply moving right.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'controlled' blocks are currently at a specific position. The game state is ripe for testing an action that previously showed no effect, provided we first change the position of the controlled blocks."
