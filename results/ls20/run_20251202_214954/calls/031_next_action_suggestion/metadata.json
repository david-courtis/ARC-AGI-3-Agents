  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n  - The 'controlled' objects are a group of two rectangular blocks, specifically a Color 12 (8x2) and a Color 9 (8x6) block, that move together.\n  - ACTION1 moves these 'controlled' blocks up by one unit.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced 'no effect' in its previous attempts. According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, it should not be retested in the same state. Therefore, it's necessary to move the 'controlled' blocks to a different position using a setup sequence before re-attempting ACTION5. Since ACTION3 has shown consistent effect in moving the blocks left, it can be used for the setup. Moving the blocks twice to the left will change the context for ACTION5. This strategy aims to explore if ACTION5 requires a specific positional context or interaction with other objects to produce an effect.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 in a new position, we hope to either observe an effect, learn more about the conditions under which ACTION5 operates, or further confirm that it does not have an immediate visible effect in most general states. We are looking to see if moving the controlled blocks to a new location triggers an effect for ACTION5.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the controllable blocks (color 12 and color 9) in a central position. There are other static objects present (yellow, purple, light blue, and black blocks). It's possible ACTION5 interacts with one of these, or is context-dependent on the proximity or alignment of the controllable blocks with other elements. The current position has not yielded any effect for ACTION5, so a change of position is required."
