  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not been observed even once, making it the highest priority. There are other unobserved actions (ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5), but we should try to get at least one observation for each basic movement action first to understand the control scheme. The current state is suitable for testing basic movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To learn the effect of ACTION2, specifically if it moves objects downwards, and if it affects the same blocks as ACTION1 or different ones. This will help understand the basic movement mechanics of the game.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various blocks present, providing a good context for observing potential movement actions. There is no immediate obstacle that would prevent a downward movement, assuming the action affects the primary movable block."
