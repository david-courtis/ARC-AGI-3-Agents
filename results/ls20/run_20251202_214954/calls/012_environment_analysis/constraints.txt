- Objects are constrained by the boundaries of the darker green play area.
- Movement appears to be in discrete units (e.g., 'moved up by one unit').
- Internal walls/fixed objects (Block stack 1, Block stack 2, Block L-shape) likely impede movement, as ACTION5 (a previous action) had no effect, suggesting a blockage.
