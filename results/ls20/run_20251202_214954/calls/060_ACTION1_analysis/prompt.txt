Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: Initial observation of ACTION1. Two specific blocks are located in the lower right of the play area, with ample space above them. There are other objects and background elements present that were unaffected.
      Interpretation: Two blocks, a color 12 rectangular block and a color 9 rectangular block, moved upwards by one unit. The color 12 block moved from row 48 to 47, and the color 9 block moved from row 50 to 49.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: Two rectangular blocks, a color 12 at (40, 40) and a color 9 at (42, 40), are in the lower right of the play area with clear space above them. These blocks have previously been observed to move with ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4.
      Interpretation: A color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) moved up one unit to (39, 40) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40) moved up one unit to (41, 40).

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64) at (0, 0) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48) at (8, 8) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16) at (16, 16) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action

Recent Observations:
  - The game has multiple distinct 'levels' or 'stages' that can be triggered by ACTION5.
  - ACTION5 can cause a complete overhaul of the game's visual state, including background, foreground objects, and UI.
  - The previously 'controlled' blocks are not retained across these environment changes initiated by ACTION5.
  - ACTION2 does not affect the newly introduced objects after a level change initiated by ACTION5.
  - The 'controlled' blocks (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)) from the previous game state are no longer present after a level change via ACTION5.
