  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 is the action with the least validation (0/3 consistent observations) and has not had a NO EFFECT result recently. Although ACTION5 also has 0/3 consistent observations, it had many recent NO EFFECTS, and we prefer testing actions that look like they're going to work in the current state. ACTION2 has consistently shown an effect, and we need to get 3 consistent observations to verify its behavior. The current state appears suitable for testing downward movement as there is space below the central objects.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify the behavior of ACTION2, specifically confirming its effect on moving objects downwards and the appearance of new blocks. We want to see if the new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' still appears at the original location of the moved main block, or if its placement is context-dependent.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board currently shows a configuration of objects. There is open space below the main interactive elements, which is good for testing downward movement (ACTION2). There are no immediate obstacles that would prevent ACTION2 from having an effect."
