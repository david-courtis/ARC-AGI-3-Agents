  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards. It also appears to cause a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear, potentially at the previous location of one of the moved main blocks, or as part of a 'drop' mechanism.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 acts as a 'reset' or 'next level' button, completely changing the game state by replacing the background, introducing new objects, and altering UI elements, effectively starting a new configuration or stage of the game. It also removes the previously 'controlled' blocks.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64) at (0, 0) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48) at (8, 8) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16) at (16, 16) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 not only moves the 'controlled' blocks down, but also causes a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear.\n  - The new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' appears at (32,32), which was the original top-left position of the Color 12 main block before it moved down.\n  - The game has multiple distinct 'levels' or 'stages' that can be triggered by ACTION5.\n  - ACTION5 can cause a complete overhaul of the game's visual state, including background, foreground objects, and UI.\n  - The previously 'controlled' blocks are not retained across these environment changes initiated by ACTION5.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 is the action with the least validation (0/3 consistent observations) and has not had a NO EFFECT result recently. Although ACTION5 also has 0/3 consistent observations, it had many recent NO EFFECTS, and we prefer testing actions that look like they're going to work in the current state. ACTION2 has consistently shown an effect, and we need to get 3 consistent observations to verify its behavior. The current state appears suitable for testing downward movement as there is space below the central objects.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Verify the behavior of ACTION2, specifically confirming its effect on moving objects downwards and the appearance of new blocks. We want to see if the new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' still appears at the original location of the moved main block, or if its placement is context-dependent.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The board currently shows a configuration of objects. There is open space below the main interactive elements, which is good for testing downward movement (ACTION2). There are no immediate obstacles that would prevent ACTION2 from having an effect."
