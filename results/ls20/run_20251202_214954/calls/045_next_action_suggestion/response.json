  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in recent attempts (6 out of last 10 actions, and its last 3 attempts were all no-effect). According to the critical rules, we must change the game state before re-testing an action that recently had no effect. Using two 'ACTION4's will move the controlled blocks to a new position to the right, which could potentially change the context enough for ACTION5 to have an effect. We have 1/3 consistency for ACTION4, so it is a good candidate for a setup action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We hope to discover the conditions under which ACTION5 has an effect. By moving the 'controlled' blocks to a different position, we might uncover a context where ACTION5 is active, or perhaps gain insight into its specific function (e.g., interaction with other objects, rotation, or selection).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows the controlled blocks (Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks) in a central position. There are other small blocks scattered. Since ACTION5 previously had no effect in this general area, it's crucial to move the 'controlled' blocks to a new location. Moving to the right provides clear space for the setup sequence."
