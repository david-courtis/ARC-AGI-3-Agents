- Objects are constrained by the boundaries of the darker green play area. Although not observed stopping at the boundary, this is a strong hypothesis.
- Movement appears to be in discrete units (e.g., 'moved up by one unit').
- Internal walls/fixed objects (Block stack 1, Block stack 2, Block L-shape) impede movement, as confirmed by ACTION5 having no visible effect when a block likely attempted to move into one of these fixed obstacles.
