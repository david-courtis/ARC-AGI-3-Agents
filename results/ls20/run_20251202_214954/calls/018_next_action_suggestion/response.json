  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no effect twice recently. To apply the critical rule, we must move the controlled objects to a different state before retesting ACTION5. Since ACTION3 has 1 consistent observation moving the blocks left, we will use it as part of the setup sequence to move the blocks to a new position. Moving left twice should significantly change the context. Prioritizing re-testing an action that has had no effect, after moving, is important for thorough exploration.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By changing the position of the controlled blocks, we hope to discover if ACTION5 has a contextual effect that requires specific surroundings, or if it interacts with other objects once the blocks are in a different location. It might reveal an interaction with the left boundary or other objects on the left side of the screen.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows the two controlled blocks at certain coordinates. ACTION5 has consistently shown no effect in this current general area. To properly investigate ACTION5, a significant change in the controlled blocks' position is needed. Using ACTION3, which moves left, is a good way to achieve this, as we've seen it work for a single unit move. Repeating it twice should move the blocks sufficiently to a new context."
