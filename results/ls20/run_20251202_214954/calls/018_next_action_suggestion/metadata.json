  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no effect twice recently. To apply the critical rule, we must move the controlled objects to a different state before retesting ACTION5. Since ACTION3 has 1 consistent observation moving the blocks left, we will use it as part of the setup sequence to move the blocks to a new position. Moving left twice should significantly change the context. Prioritizing re-testing an action that has had no effect, after moving, is important for thorough exploration.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By changing the position of the controlled blocks, we hope to discover if ACTION5 has a contextual effect that requires specific surroundings, or if it interacts with other objects once the blocks are in a different location. It might reveal an interaction with the left boundary or other objects on the left side of the screen.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows the two controlled blocks at certain coordinates. ACTION5 has consistently shown no effect in this current general area. To properly investigate ACTION5, a significant change in the controlled blocks' position is needed. Using ACTION3, which moves left, is a good way to achieve this, as we've seen it work for a single unit move. Repeating it twice should move the blocks sufficiently to a new context."
