  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been observed, making it the highest priority for testing. All other actions have at least one observation, even if not yet verified. It's best to test unobserved actions immediately since they represent the biggest information gain opportunity.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Discovering the effect of ACTION5, which could be interaction, selection, or rotation. This is a critical next step to understand the game mechanics.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing a new action. There are various objects on the screen that 'INTERACT' or 'SELECT' could potentially target. There is no indication that any particular setup is required for a first test of ACTION5 given its unknown nature."
