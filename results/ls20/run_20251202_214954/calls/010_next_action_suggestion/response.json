  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been observed, making it the highest priority for testing. All other actions have at least one observation, even if not yet verified. It's best to test unobserved actions immediately since they represent the biggest information gain opportunity.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discovering the effect of ACTION5, which could be interaction, selection, or rotation. This is a critical next step to understand the game mechanics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing a new action. There are various objects on the screen that 'INTERACT' or 'SELECT' could potentially target. There is no indication that any particular setup is required for a first test of ACTION5 given its unknown nature."
