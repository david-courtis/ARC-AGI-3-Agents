1. Confirmed that ACTION4 can move multiple objects simultaneously, specifically 'Moving Block 1' and 'Moving Block 2' which both moved 'right'.
2. Confirmed that the effect of ACTION4 can be nullified or blocked, as it had no effect in this observation despite working previously for the same objects. This suggests context-dependent action outcomes or a new type of barrier.
3. Discovered that UI elements can change dynamically, as one of the 'Top UI elements - Indicators' (orange squares) changed color to green, indicating a potential game state change, score update, or progress.
