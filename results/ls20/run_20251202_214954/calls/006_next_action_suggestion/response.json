  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 and ACTION4 are completely unobserved. It is always a priority to observe unobserved actions first. Testing ACTION3 next allows us to begin understanding its effect, especially given that ACTION1 and ACTION2 seem to manipulate specific blocks. We should test simple actions first before more complex ones like ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To understand if ACTION3 moves the 'player' or 'selected' object horizontally, and if it affects the same blocks as ACTION1 and ACTION2, or different ones. We want to see if it has any effect at all.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game state currently has two visible blocks that react to vertical movement (ACTION1 and ACTION2). There are no obvious walls or obstacles preventing horizontal movement of these blocks if ACTION3 or ACTION4 control them. It's a good state to test horizontal movement."
