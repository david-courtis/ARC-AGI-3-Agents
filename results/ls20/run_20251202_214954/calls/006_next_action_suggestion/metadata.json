It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards.\n  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION3 and ACTION4 are completely unobserved. It is always a priority to observe unobserved actions first. Testing ACTION3 next allows us to begin understanding its effect, especially given that ACTION1 and ACTION2 seem to manipulate specific blocks. We should test simple actions first before more complex ones like ACTION5.",
    "expected_information_gain": "To understand if ACTION3 moves the 'player' or 'selected' object horizontally, and if it affects the same blocks as ACTION1 and ACTION2, or different ones. We want to see if it has any effect at all.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The game state currently has two visible blocks that react to vertical movement (ACTION1 and ACTION2). There are no obvious walls or obstacles preventing horizontal movement of these blocks if ACTION3 or ACTION4 control them. It's a good state to test horizontal movement."
