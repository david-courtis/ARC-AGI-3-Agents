  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards. It also appears to cause a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear, potentially at the previous location of one of the moved main blocks, or as part of a 'drop' mechanism.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 acts as a 'reset' or 'next level' button, completely changing the game state by replacing the background, introducing new objects, and altering UI elements, effectively starting a new configuration or stage of the game. It also removes the previously 'controlled' blocks.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64) at (0, 0) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48) at (8, 8) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16) at (16, 16) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The game has multiple distinct 'levels' or 'stages' that can be triggered by ACTION5.\n  - ACTION5 can cause a complete overhaul of the game's visual state, including background, foreground objects, and UI.\n  - The previously 'controlled' blocks are not retained across these environment changes initiated by ACTION5.\n  - ACTION2 does not affect the newly introduced objects after a level change initiated by ACTION5.\n  - The 'controlled' blocks (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)) from the previous game state are no longer present after a level change via ACTION5.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "setup_sequence": [],
    "reasoning": "ACTION1 only has 1/3 consistent observations and 2/8 attempts, making it a high priority for further validation. It has not had a 'no effect' result recently, so it's safe to test it directly. The current state has various objects, and ACTION1 has been observed to move specific blocks upwards, so there is potential for it to interact with the current objects.",
    "expected_information_gain": "To get more observations for ACTION1 and move towards its verification. Specifically, to see if it moves any of the newly appeared objects from the last ACTION5 effect, or if it has another context-dependent effect.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is post-ACTION5, meaning new objects are present. The previous 'controlled' blocks are gone. This is a good opportunity to test if ACTION1 interacts with these new objects or establishes control over them."
