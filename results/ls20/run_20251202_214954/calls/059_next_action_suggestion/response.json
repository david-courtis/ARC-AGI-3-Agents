  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 only has 1/3 consistent observations and 2/8 attempts, making it a high priority for further validation. It has not had a 'no effect' result recently, so it's safe to test it directly. The current state has various objects, and ACTION1 has been observed to move specific blocks upwards, so there is potential for it to interact with the current objects.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get more observations for ACTION1 and move towards its verification. Specifically, to see if it moves any of the newly appeared objects from the last ACTION5 effect, or if it has another context-dependent effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is post-ACTION5, meaning new objects are present. The previous 'controlled' blocks are gone. This is a good opportunity to test if ACTION1 interacts with these new objects or establishes control over them."
