  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in recent attempts and is the only action with 0 consistent observations. To effectively test it and gather new information, we need to move the 'controlled blocks' to a new position. While none of the movement actions are fully verified, ACTION3 (move left) has 1/3 consistency and has been observed to move the blocks. We will use it twice, then use ACTION1 (move up), which also has some observed effect, to change the position significantly. This will create a new context for ACTION5 to be tested, increasing the likelihood of observing a different outcome or confirming its function (or lack thereof) across different states.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 in a new position, we hope to either observe an effect, helping to define its function, or confirm that it still has no effect in a different context, which helps to refine our understanding of its conditions for activation. We also aim to gather more observations for ACTION1 and ACTION3.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows two 'controlled' rectangular blocks near the center-right of the screen. There's a clear path to move them left and up. The previous tests of ACTION5 were all in similar positions, leading to no effect. A change in position is crucial for further exploration of ACTION5."
