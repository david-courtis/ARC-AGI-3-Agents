  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in recent attempts and is the only action with 0 consistent observations. To effectively test it and gather new information, we need to move the 'controlled blocks' to a new position. While none of the movement actions are fully verified, ACTION3 (move left) has 1/3 consistency and has been observed to move the blocks. We will use it twice, then use ACTION1 (move up), which also has some observed effect, to change the position significantly. This will create a new context for ACTION5 to be tested, increasing the likelihood of observing a different outcome or confirming its function (or lack thereof) across different states.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 in a new position, we hope to either observe an effect, helping to define its function, or confirm that it still has no effect in a different context, which helps to refine our understanding of its conditions for activation. We also aim to gather more observations for ACTION1 and ACTION3.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows two 'controlled' rectangular blocks near the center-right of the screen. There's a clear path to move them left and up. The previous tests of ACTION5 were all in similar positions, leading to no effect. A change in position is crucial for further exploration of ACTION5."
