  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:\n\"None\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT\n      Context: Two rectangular blocks are present in the lower right of the play area, with ample clear space to their right. These specific blocks have been observed to move with ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3.\n      Interpretation: Two blocks, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6), moved one unit to the right. The color 12 block moved from column 32 to 33, and the color 9 block moved from column 32 to 33.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements.
