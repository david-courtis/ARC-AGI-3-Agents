  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had no effect, so we need to test a different action first. All other actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) have been attempted once and are in the 'pending' state. ACTION3 has only been attempted once and needs more validation. There is no indication that the current state is bad for testing ACTION3.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validate the behavior of ACTION3, specifically its role in moving the 'controlled' blocks to the left.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state includes several rectangular blocks, some of which appear to be 'controlled' by previous actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION4). The board is relatively open, providing space to test movement actions. There are no obvious obstacles preventing movement."
