  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had no effect, so we need to test a different action first. All other actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) have been attempted once and are in the 'pending' state. ACTION3 has only been attempted once and needs more validation. There is no indication that the current state is bad for testing ACTION3.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Further validate the behavior of ACTION3, specifically its role in moving the 'controlled' blocks to the left.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current game state includes several rectangular blocks, some of which appear to be 'controlled' by previous actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION4). The board is relatively open, providing space to test movement actions. There are no obvious obstacles preventing movement."
