  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced 'NO EFFECT' in its last 4 attempts. According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first before retrying it. Since ACTION4 has shown a consistent movement effect (moving blocks to the right) and has not yet been verified, it serves as a good candidate for the setup sequence. Moving the controlled blocks to a new position should provide a different context for testing ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the controlled blocks to a new position using ACTION4, we hope to change the context for ACTION5. This will tell us if ACTION5 requires a specific surrounding or object to interact with, or if its effect is conditional on the blocks' location. If it still has no effect, we'll continue to explore other positions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows two controlled blocks (color 12 and color 9) at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. They are located centrally on the screen. There are no obvious objects in their immediate vicinity that ACTION5 (INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE) could act upon, which might explain the consistent 'NO EFFECT' in the previous attempts. We need to move these blocks to a different location to see if ACTION5 becomes active."
