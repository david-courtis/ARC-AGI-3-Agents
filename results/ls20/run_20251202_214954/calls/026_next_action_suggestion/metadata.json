  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced 'NO EFFECT' in its last 4 attempts. According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first before retrying it. Since ACTION4 has shown a consistent movement effect (moving blocks to the right) and has not yet been verified, it serves as a good candidate for the setup sequence. Moving the controlled blocks to a new position should provide a different context for testing ACTION5.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By moving the controlled blocks to a new position using ACTION4, we hope to change the context for ACTION5. This will tell us if ACTION5 requires a specific surrounding or object to interact with, or if its effect is conditional on the blocks' location. If it still has no effect, we'll continue to explore other positions.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows two controlled blocks (color 12 and color 9) at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. They are located centrally on the screen. There are no obvious objects in their immediate vicinity that ACTION5 (INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE) could act upon, which might explain the consistent 'NO EFFECT' in the previous attempts. We need to move these blocks to a different location to see if ACTION5 becomes active."
