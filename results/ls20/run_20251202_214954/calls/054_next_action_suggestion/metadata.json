  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards. It also appears to cause a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear, potentially at the previous location of one of the moved main blocks, or as part of a 'drop' mechanism.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n  - The 'controlled' objects are a group of two rectangular blocks, specifically a Color 12 (8x2) and a Color 9 (8x6) block, that move together.\n  - ACTION1 moves these 'controlled' blocks up by one unit.\n  - ACTION2 not only moves the 'controlled' blocks down, but also causes a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear.\n  - The new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' appears at (32,32), which was the original top-left position of the Color 12 main block before it moved down.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had 3 consecutive 'no effect' results, so we must change the game state before testing it again. Currently, ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 only have 1/3 consistent observations. While a full verification isn't possible yet, we need a setup move. ACTION4 is a good choice because it moves the controlled blocks to the right. This changes the 'controlled' blocks' position, which might influence ACTION5's effect. We prioritize retesting ACTION5 since it has had zero consistent observations.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect from ACTION5 now that the 'controlled' blocks have moved. This would help us narrow down its function, especially if it relates to position or interaction with other objects that become relatively closer or further due to the move.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The 'controlled' objects are currently at (48, 40) and (50, 40) for the color 12 and color 9 blocks respectively. There is free space to the right of them according to the image, making ACTION4 a safe move. ACTION5 has been repeatedly tested in the previous state with no effect. Shifting the 'controlled' blocks right by one unit using an unverified movement action is a good strategy to enable further testing of ACTION5 in a new context."
