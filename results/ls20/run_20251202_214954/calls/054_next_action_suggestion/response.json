  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had 3 consecutive 'no effect' results, so we must change the game state before testing it again. Currently, ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 only have 1/3 consistent observations. While a full verification isn't possible yet, we need a setup move. ACTION4 is a good choice because it moves the controlled blocks to the right. This changes the 'controlled' blocks' position, which might influence ACTION5's effect. We prioritize retesting ACTION5 since it has had zero consistent observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect from ACTION5 now that the 'controlled' blocks have moved. This would help us narrow down its function, especially if it relates to position or interaction with other objects that become relatively closer or further due to the move.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'controlled' objects are currently at (48, 40) and (50, 40) for the color 12 and color 9 blocks respectively. There is free space to the right of them according to the image, making ACTION4 a safe move. ACTION5 has been repeatedly tested in the previous state with no effect. Shifting the 'controlled' blocks right by one unit using an unverified movement action is a good strategy to enable further testing of ACTION5 in a new context."
