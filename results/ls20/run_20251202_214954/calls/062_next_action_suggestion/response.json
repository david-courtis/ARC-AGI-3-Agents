  "reasoning": "ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION5 recently had 'NO EFFECT' in this or a similar state, meaning they should not be tested again without a change in position. ACTION3 is 1/3 consistent and 2/8 attempts, but ACTION4 is also 1/3 consistent and 2/8 attempts. Both are equally unverified. However, the last recorded effect for ACTION4 indicated it moved objects 'to the right, provided there is clear space to their right'. The current board does not show 'controlled' blocks moving. Given that no actions currently move the 'controlled' blocks in this state, we need to test actions that might become active under new circumstances. Since none of the movement actions (ACTION1-ACTION4) are verified, and we cannot reliably move to a new position, we must try an action that hasn't had a 'NO EFFECT' in the immediate past. ACTION4 has not had a 'NO EFFECT' in the last 10 attempts. We need to try to get one of the movement actions to produce an effect to verify them, so we can then use them to strategically change the game state. Since we are in a new level due to the last successful ACTION5, the previous 'NO EFFECT' for ACTION1 and ACTION2 were in the new state, but for ACTION4 there were no recently recorded 'NO EFFECT' in the new state. Also consider we need 3 consistent observations to verify an action, and we only have 1 for ACTION4. We should observe its behavior in this new context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe if ACTION4 has an effect on any current objects, especially those newly introduced after the last successful ACTION5. This could provide an observation towards verifying ACTION4 and identifying which objects it controls in this new game state. If it has no effect, it means we need to try movement actions again once the game state changes, or if we find a way to manipulate the 'controlled' objects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game state is a result of a successful ACTION5. It features a new background, and various new objects such as a 'Color 4 irregular shape (64x64) at (0, 0)', 'Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56)', 'Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60)', 'Color 3 irregular shape (48x48) at (8, 8)', and 'Color 4 rectangular block (8x16) at (16, 16)'. The 'controlled' blocks from the previous state are absent. This is a fresh 'level' or configuration. Many recent actions had no effect, indicating the previous 'controlled' objects are no longer active, and we need to discover what, if anything, is controllable in this new state."
