  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards. It also appears to cause a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear, potentially at the previous location of one of the moved main blocks, or as part of a 'drop' mechanism.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 acts as a 'reset' or 'next level' button, completely changing the game state by replacing the background, introducing new objects, and altering UI elements, effectively starting a new configuration or stage of the game. It also removes the previously 'controlled' blocks.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64) at (0, 0) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48) at (8, 8) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16) at (16, 16) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 can cause a complete overhaul of the game's visual state, including background, foreground objects, and UI.\n  - The previously 'controlled' blocks are not retained across these environment changes initiated by ACTION5.\n  - ACTION2 does not affect the newly introduced objects after a level change initiated by ACTION5.\n  - The 'controlled' blocks (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)) from the previous game state are no longer present after a level change via ACTION5.\n  - ACTION1, like ACTION2, appears to be non-functional on objects present after a level change initiated by ACTION5. This suggests the effects of ACTION1 and ACTION2 are limited to specific game states or specific object types that are removed upon a level transition.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION5 recently had 'NO EFFECT' in this or a similar state, meaning they should not be tested again without a change in position. ACTION3 is 1/3 consistent and 2/8 attempts, but ACTION4 is also 1/3 consistent and 2/8 attempts. Both are equally unverified. However, the last recorded effect for ACTION4 indicated it moved objects 'to the right, provided there is clear space to their right'. The current board does not show 'controlled' blocks moving. Given that no actions currently move the 'controlled' blocks in this state, we need to test actions that might become active under new circumstances. Since none of the movement actions (ACTION1-ACTION4) are verified, and we cannot reliably move to a new position, we must try an action that hasn't had a 'NO EFFECT' in the immediate past. ACTION4 has not had a 'NO EFFECT' in the last 10 attempts. We need to try to get one of the movement actions to produce an effect to verify them, so we can then use them to strategically change the game state. Since we are in a new level due to the last successful ACTION5, the previous 'NO EFFECT' for ACTION1 and ACTION2 were in the new state, but for ACTION4 there were no recently recorded 'NO EFFECT' in the new state. Also consider we need 3 consistent observations to verify an action, and we only have 1 for ACTION4. We should observe its behavior in this new context.",
    "expected_information_gain": "To observe if ACTION4 has an effect on any current objects, especially those newly introduced after the last successful ACTION5. This could provide an observation towards verifying ACTION4 and identifying which objects it controls in this new game state. If it has no effect, it means we need to try movement actions again once the game state changes, or if we find a way to manipulate the 'controlled' objects.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The game state is a result of a successful ACTION5. It features a new background, and various new objects such as a 'Color 4 irregular shape (64x64) at (0, 0)', 'Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56)', 'Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60)', 'Color 3 irregular shape (48x48) at (8, 8)', and 'Color 4 rectangular block (8x16) at (16, 16)'. The 'controlled' blocks from the previous state are absent. This is a fresh 'level' or configuration. Many recent actions had no effect, indicating the previous 'controlled' objects are no longer active, and we need to discover what, if anything, is controllable in this new state."
