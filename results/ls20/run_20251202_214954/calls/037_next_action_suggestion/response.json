  "target_action": "ACTION2",

  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in the current state and should not be re-attempted without moving. All other actions (ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4) have had partial success, and ACTION2 has the fewest successful observations (0/3 consistent), making it the top priority for validation. Since ACTION2 has only been attempted 1 time in the current position, there is still value in testing it again to reach the 3 consistent observations for verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get more consistent observations for ACTION2 to verify its effect. We expect the 'controlled' blocks (Color 12 at (40, 40) and Color 9 at (42, 40) or similar coordinates from new starting positions) to move downwards by one unit.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the 'controlled' blocks, which can be moved by ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4. ACTION5 consistently has no effect in this setup. Testing ACTION2 again seems appropriate to further validate its definition. The blocks are in a position where downward movement should be possible without immediately hitting an obstacle, as there is open space below them."
