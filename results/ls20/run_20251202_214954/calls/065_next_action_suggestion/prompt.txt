Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards. It also appears to cause a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear, potentially at the previous location of one of the moved main blocks, or as part of a 'drop' mechanism.
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 attempts to move a pair of specific rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6)) one unit to the right. This effect is conditional on being in the game state before a level change caused by ACTION5. After a level change by ACTION5, this action may have no effect, as the original responsive blocks are no longer present or are in a non-responsive game state.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 acts as a 'reset' or 'next level' button, completely changing the game state by replacing the background, introducing new objects, and altering UI elements, effectively starting a new configuration or stage of the game. It also removes the previously 'controlled' blocks.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64) at (0, 0) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48) at (8, 8) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16) at (16, 16) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION2 does not affect the newly introduced objects after a level change initiated by ACTION5.
  - The 'controlled' blocks (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)) from the previous game state are no longer present after a level change via ACTION5.
  - ACTION1, like ACTION2, appears to be non-functional on objects present after a level change initiated by ACTION5. This suggests the effects of ACTION1 and ACTION2 are limited to specific game states or specific object types that are removed upon a level transition.
  - ACTION4's effect is conditional and does not function on objects present after a level change initiated by ACTION5.
  - The environment after an ACTION5 trigger seems to reset the behavior of previously responsive objects to other actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4).

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5
