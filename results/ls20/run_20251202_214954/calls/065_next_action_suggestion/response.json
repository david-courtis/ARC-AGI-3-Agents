  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "All movement actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION4) had no effect in the current state recently, and ACTION5 also had no effect multiple times. Since no movement actions are verified, we cannot create a setup sequence. Therefore, we must test an action that has not been tested and resulted in 'no effect' in the current state. ACTION3 has not shown 'no effect' recently (its last effect was consistent). This makes ACTION3 the most viable candidate for testing without a setup sequence.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We hope to see if ACTION3 can still move the 'controlled' blocks in this new game state, or if its effect is also nullified by the ACTION5-induced level change. This will help us further understand if any of the original movement actions are still functional after a level reset or if there are new 'controlled' objects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game state currently shows new objects and a new background, resulting from a previous ACTION5 execution. The objects that were responsive to ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 in previous states are no longer present. It is unclear if any existing objects are responsive to these actions, or if new target objects exist for these actions. Most actions have recently resulted in 'no effect'."
