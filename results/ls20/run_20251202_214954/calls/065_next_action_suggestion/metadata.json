  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards. It also appears to cause a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear, potentially at the previous location of one of the moved main blocks, or as part of a 'drop' mechanism.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 attempts to move a pair of specific rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6)) one unit to the right. This effect is conditional on being in the game state before a level change caused by ACTION5. After a level change by ACTION5, this action may have no effect, as the original responsive blocks are no longer present or are in a non-responsive game state.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 acts as a 'reset' or 'next level' button, completely changing the game state by replacing the background, introducing new objects, and altering UI elements, effectively starting a new configuration or stage of the game. It also removes the previously 'controlled' blocks.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64) at (0, 0) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48) at (8, 8) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16) at (16, 16) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 does not affect the newly introduced objects after a level change initiated by ACTION5.\n  - The 'controlled' blocks (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)) from the previous game state are no longer present after a level change via ACTION5.\n  - ACTION1, like ACTION2, appears to be non-functional on objects present after a level change initiated by ACTION5. This suggests the effects of ACTION1 and ACTION2 are limited to specific game states or specific object types that are removed upon a level transition.\n  - ACTION4's effect is conditional and does not function on objects present after a level change initiated by ACTION5.\n  - The environment after an ACTION5 trigger seems to reset the behavior of previously responsive objects to other actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4).\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "setup_sequence": [],
    "reasoning": "All movement actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION4) had no effect in the current state recently, and ACTION5 also had no effect multiple times. Since no movement actions are verified, we cannot create a setup sequence. Therefore, we must test an action that has not been tested and resulted in 'no effect' in the current state. ACTION3 has not shown 'no effect' recently (its last effect was consistent). This makes ACTION3 the most viable candidate for testing without a setup sequence.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We hope to see if ACTION3 can still move the 'controlled' blocks in this new game state, or if its effect is also nullified by the ACTION5-induced level change. This will help us further understand if any of the original movement actions are still functional after a level reset or if there are new 'controlled' objects.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The game state currently shows new objects and a new background, resulting from a previous ACTION5 execution. The objects that were responsive to ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 in previous states are no longer present. It is unclear if any existing objects are responsive to these actions, or if new target objects exist for these actions. Most actions have recently resulted in 'no effect'."
