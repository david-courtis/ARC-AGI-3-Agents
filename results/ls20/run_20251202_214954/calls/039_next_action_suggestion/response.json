  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced no effect in the current position, indicating it likely requires a different context or interaction with a specific object. Since no movement actions are fully verified, I will use ACTION3, which has 1/3 consistency and has shown to move the controlled blocks. Moving the 'controlled' blocks to a new position using ACTION3 is the best option to try and find a context where ACTION5 might actually have an effect. By moving to the left, we ensure a different state for testing ACTION5. ACTION3 has successfully moved the blocks before, so it's a good candidate for setup.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a movement action, we hope to observe a concrete effect, thus gaining more information about its function and the conditions under which it operates. We also increase the consistency count for ACTION3. If it still has no effect, we will know it's not simply a matter of the previous position.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current controlled blocks are located at (48,40) and (50,40) for color 12 and color 9, respectively. ACTION5 has been tried multiple times in this position without effect. The board currently has some other blocks, but their specific relevance to ACTION5 is unknown. Moving the controlled blocks is necessary to attempt to find a valid context for ACTION5."
