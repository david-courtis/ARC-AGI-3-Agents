  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards. It also appears to cause a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear, potentially at the previous location of one of the moved main blocks, or as part of a 'drop' mechanism.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n  - The 'controlled' objects are a group of two rectangular blocks, specifically a Color 12 (8x2) and a Color 9 (8x6) block, that move together.\n  - ACTION1 moves these 'controlled' blocks up by one unit.\n  - ACTION2 not only moves the 'controlled' blocks down, but also causes a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear.\n  - The new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' appears at (32,32), which was the original top-left position of the Color 12 main block before it moved down.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced no effect in the current position, indicating it likely requires a different context or interaction with a specific object. Since no movement actions are fully verified, I will use ACTION3, which has 1/3 consistency and has shown to move the controlled blocks. Moving the 'controlled' blocks to a new position using ACTION3 is the best option to try and find a context where ACTION5 might actually have an effect. By moving to the left, we ensure a different state for testing ACTION5. ACTION3 has successfully moved the blocks before, so it's a good candidate for setup.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a movement action, we hope to observe a concrete effect, thus gaining more information about its function and the conditions under which it operates. We also increase the consistency count for ACTION3. If it still has no effect, we will know it's not simply a matter of the previous position.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current controlled blocks are located at (48,40) and (50,40) for color 12 and color 9, respectively. ACTION5 has been tried multiple times in this position without effect. The board currently has some other blocks, but their specific relevance to ACTION5 is unknown. Moving the controlled blocks is necessary to attempt to find a valid context for ACTION5."
