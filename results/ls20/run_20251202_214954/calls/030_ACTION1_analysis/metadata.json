  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:\n\"ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT\n      Context: Initial observation of ACTION1. Two specific blocks are located in the lower right of the play area, with ample space above them. There are other objects and background elements present that were unaffected.\n      Interpretation: Two blocks, a color 12 rectangular block and a color 9 rectangular block, moved upwards by one unit. The color 12 block moved from row 48 to 47, and the color 9 block moved from row 50 to 49.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [20-47]\n\nChanged pixels: (2,20): 15->3, (32,40): 3->12, (32,41): 3->12, (32,42): 3->12, (32,43): 3->12, (32,44): 3->12, (32,45): 3->12, (32,46): 3->12, (32,47): 3->12, (33,40): 3->12, (33,41): 3->12, (33,42): 3->12, (33,43): 3->12, (33,44): 3->12, (33,45): 3->12, (33,46): 3->12, (33,47): 3->12, (34,40): 3->9, (34,41): 3->9, (34,42): 3->9, (34,43): 3->9, (34,44): 3->9, (34,45): 3->9, (34,46): 3->9, (34,47): 3->9, (35,40): 3->9, (35,41): 3->9, (35,42): 3->9, (35,43): 3->9, (35,44): 3->9 ... and 99 more\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
