1. Confirmed that the previous ACTION5 having no effect was due to an impassable barrier. This reinforces the understanding that 'Block stack 1', 'Block stack 2', and 'Block L-shape' behave as solid walls/obstacles, blocking attempted movement.
2. The repeated observation of ACTION5 having no effect provides further strong evidence for the solid, unpassable nature of 'Block stack 1', 'Block stack 2', and 'Block L-shape', solidifying their role as fixed environmental barriers.
