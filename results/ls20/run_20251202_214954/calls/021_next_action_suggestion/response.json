  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has one attempt and 0/3 consistent observations. It's similar to ACTION1 and ACTION2 which both had effects, so it's a good candidate to get more data on. Additionally, ACTION5 has consistently had no effect, so we should avoid retrying it in the current state without a position change. ACTION1/2/3 also need more data but ACTION4 currently has the least amount of data among the actions that have shown some effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get a second observation for ACTION4 to verify if it consistently moves the controlled blocks to the right.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state is suitable for testing movement actions as the blocks are centrally located and not at boundaries."
