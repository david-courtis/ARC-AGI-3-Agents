  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has no observations yet, making it the highest priority for testing. We want to understand its basic functionality. There is no indication that the current state is bad for testing a general movement action like ACTION4.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the basic function of ACTION4 (e.g., does it move the player, or some other object, and in what direction). This will help in defining its effect and potentially using it in future setup sequences.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board appears to be in a neutral state, suitable for testing a new action. We have a couple of controlled blocks that move up and down, and it's unclear what else is interactive. Testing an unknown directional action from a central-ish position is a good starting point."
