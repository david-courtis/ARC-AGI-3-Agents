Ample clear space surrounds them. No other specific changes immediately preceded this action. Other background elements and UI elements are present and remained unchanged.\n      Interpretation: The action ACTION5 had no visible effect on any objects or the general environment.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Two rectangular blocks, a color 12 at (40, 32) and a color 9 at (42, 32), are present in the lower right area. Ample clear space surrounds them. No other specific changes immediately preceded this action. Other background elements and UI elements are present and remained unchanged.\n      Interpretation: The action ACTION5 had no visible effect on any objects or the general environment.\n  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Two rectangular blocks, a color 12 at (40, 40) and a color 9 at (42, 40), are present in the lower right area.
