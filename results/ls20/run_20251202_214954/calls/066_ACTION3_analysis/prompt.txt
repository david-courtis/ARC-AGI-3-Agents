Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:
"ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: Two rectangular blocks are present in the lower right of the play area, with ample clear space to their left. These specific blocks have been observed to move with ACTION1 and ACTION2.
      Interpretation: Two blocks, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40), moved one unit to the left. The color 12 block moved from column 40 to 39, and the color 9 block moved from column 40 to 39.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: Two rectangular blocks, a color 12 at (48, 40) and a color 9 at (50, 40), are present in the lower right area with clear space to their left. These blocks have been observed to move with ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION4.
      Interpretation: Two blocks, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6), moved one unit to the left. The color 12 block moved from column 40 to 39, and the color 9 block moved from column 40 to 39.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64) at (0, 0) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48) at (8, 8) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16) at (16, 16) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION2 does not affect the newly introduced objects after a level change initiated by ACTION5.
  - The 'controlled' blocks (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)) from the previous game state are no longer present after a level change via ACTION5.
  - ACTION1, like ACTION2, appears to be non-functional on objects present after a level change initiated by ACTION5. This suggests the effects of ACTION1 and ACTION2 are limited to specific game states or specific object types that are removed upon a level transition.
  - ACTION4's effect is conditional and does not function on objects present after a level change initiated by ACTION5.
  - The environment after an ACTION5 trigger seems to reset the behavior of previously responsive objects to other actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4).
