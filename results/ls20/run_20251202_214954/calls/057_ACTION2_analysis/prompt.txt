Analyze the effect of action ACTION2.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION2:
"ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards. It also appears to cause a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear, potentially at the previous location of one of the moved main blocks, or as part of a 'drop' mechanism."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: Two rectangular blocks, previously at (40, 40) and (42, 40) respectively, are located in the lower right of the play area, with ample clear space below them. There are other objects and background elements present that were unaffected.
      Interpretation: Two blocks, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6), moved downwards by one unit. The color 12 block moved from row 40 to 41, and the color 9 block moved from row 42 to 43.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The scene contains a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32,32) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34,32). Several other objects are present including a 48x48 shape at (8, 8), a 64x64 shape at (0, 0), and various smaller blocks of different colors. Clear space is available below the two 'controlled' blocks. The top_ui also changed one pixel.
      Interpretation: A color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32) moved down one unit to (33, 32), and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32) moved down one unit to (35, 32). Additionally, a new color 9 rectangular block (2x2) appeared at (32, 32).

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64) at (0, 0) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48) at (8, 8) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16) at (16, 16) (appeared): Involved in ACTION5 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION2 not only moves the 'controlled' blocks down, but also causes a new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' to appear.
  - The new 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' appears at (32,32), which was the original top-left position of the Color 12 main block before it moved down.
  - The game has multiple distinct 'levels' or 'stages' that can be triggered by ACTION5.
  - ACTION5 can cause a complete overhaul of the game's visual state, including background, foreground objects, and UI.
  - The previously 'controlled' blocks are not retained across these environment changes initiated by ACTION5.
