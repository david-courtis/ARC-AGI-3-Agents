This suggests that the previously 'controlled' blocks (Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks) that respond to ACTION2 are no longer present in the game's current state, or they are no longer interactable given the dramatic environment change caused by the previous ACTION5. The current screen shows a new arrangement of objects and a green background, indicating a 'new level' where ACTION2 is either inactive or operates on different, yet-to-be-identified objects.",

The specific 'controlled' color 12 and color 9 rectangular blocks that previously responded to ACTION2 are not visible. Numerous new objects are present, including a large green background (Color 4 irregular shape), a Color 3 irregular shape, and various smaller blocks. UI elements are also present at the top and bottom of the screen.",
