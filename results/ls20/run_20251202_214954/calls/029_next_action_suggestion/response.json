  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has only been attempted once and still needs two more consistent observations to be verified. All actions currently lack verification, but ACTION1 is tied for the least number of attempts. ACTION5 has seen multiple 'no effect' outcomes recently, so it's best to test other pending actions first or move to a new position before retesting ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validation of whether ACTION1 consistently moves objects upwards as initially observed, or if it has other effects under different conditions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current controlled objects (color 12 and color 9 blocks) are in a central position, allowing for movement in multiple directions. There are no obvious immediate obstacles that would prevent a successful ACTION1 test. The current state is suitable for testing basic movement actions."
