  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the two 'controlled' rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9, of sizes 8x2 and 8x6 respectively) one unit to the right, provided there is clear space to their right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION1 has only been attempted once and still needs two more consistent observations to be verified. All actions currently lack verification, but ACTION1 is tied for the least number of attempts. ACTION5 has seen multiple 'no effect' outcomes recently, so it's best to test other pending actions first or move to a new position before retesting ACTION5.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Further validation of whether ACTION1 consistently moves objects upwards as initially observed, or if it has other effects under different conditions.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current controlled objects (color 12 and color 9 blocks) are in a central position, allowing for movement in multiple directions. There are no obvious immediate obstacles that would prevent a successful ACTION1 test. The current state is suitable for testing basic movement actions."
