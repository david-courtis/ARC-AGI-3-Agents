  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt (attempt 5). According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first before retrying it. Since ACTION3 has some consistency and moves the blocks, it's a good candidate for a setup move. Moving the blocks with ACTION3 will change the position, creating a new state to test ACTION5 from.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to discover if ACTION5 has a context-dependent effect that might be revealed by changing the position of the controlled blocks. We hope to get a successful observation for ACTION5 or further understand the conditions under which it has no effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current controlled blocks are two blocks, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6), which last moved left. ACTION5 previously had no effect. The environment seems to be a grid-based puzzle or block manipulation game. There are no obvious interaction points in the immediate vicinity of the controlled blocks."
