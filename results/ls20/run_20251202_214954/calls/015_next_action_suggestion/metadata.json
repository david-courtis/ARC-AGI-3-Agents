  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a 'player' object or 'selected' object upwards by one unit. It appears to apply to specific blocks in the play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected (or 'active') blocks to move one unit downwards. This action appears to be the inverse of ACTION1, which caused blocks to move upwards.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the currently controlled blocks one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be an action that has no immediate visible effect given the current game state, or it might require specific conditions not met here.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 moves specific blocks downwards by one unit.\n  - The two blocks involved in ACTION1 (upward movement) are also involved in ACTION2 (downward movement), suggesting they are 'controlled' objects.\n  - ACTION4 moves the 'controlled' blocks to the right by one unit.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt (attempt 5). According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first before retrying it. Since ACTION3 has some consistency and moves the blocks, it's a good candidate for a setup move. Moving the blocks with ACTION3 will change the position, creating a new state to test ACTION5 from.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to discover if ACTION5 has a context-dependent effect that might be revealed by changing the position of the controlled blocks. We hope to get a successful observation for ACTION5 or further understand the conditions under which it has no effect.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current controlled blocks are two blocks, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6), which last moved left. ACTION5 previously had no effect. The environment seems to be a grid-based puzzle or block manipulation game. There are no obvious interaction points in the immediate vicinity of the controlled blocks."
