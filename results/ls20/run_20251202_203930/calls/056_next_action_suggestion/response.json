  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no visible effect in its initial attempts. It is the least explored action with 0 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts. To get initial observations for this action, we must test it immediately. Since we have no verified movement steps we can move the avatar. We will simply test it from the current position to get an initial observation. If it again has no effect, we will know it is likely not position-dependent and will consider new strategies to test it.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a initial observation of ACTION5 (whether it has a visible effect or not). If it has an effect, we will start understanding its functionality. If it doesn't, it will support the theory that it might be an internal state change or context-dependent and we will prioritize trying it from different locations in the future.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and doesn't seem to favor or disfavor any particular action or context for actions like ACTION5, which currently has no known effects."
