  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 systematically affects 8x8 blocks in the play area (rows 24-39, columns 40-47), causing color changes. Specifically, it changes color 3 blocks to color 12 in the region (24,40)-(25,47), and color 3 blocks to color 9 in the region (26,40)-(31,47). It also changes a pixel at (2,X) from color 15 to 3, where X is 2, 12, or 14.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a contiguous group of 8x8 blocks of varying colors (so far 12 and 9) to change to color 3. The affected blocks are located in the upper or lower right section of the play area. It also affects a single pixel in the top UI, changing it from color 15 to color 3. The column of this UI pixel often varies (2, 4, 12, 14, 16) but is always in row 2.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 changes specific pixels or 8x8 blocks of specific colors to other colors. It affects both the UI and the play area. Specifically, it can change a pixel of color 15 in the UI to color 3. In the play area, it appears to interact with 8x8 blocks of colors 3, 12, and 9, performing a color swap between 3 and 12, and changing 9 to 3.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 appears to involve a color swapping mechanism within the play area for specific 8x8 blocks, similar to ACTION3. It also causes a change in a UI element, specifically altering the color of a pixel within the top UI bar. Specifically, it swaps 8x8 blocks of colors 3 and 12, and potentially affects blocks of color 9 in the vicinity. The pixel at (2,8) in the UI changes from 15 to 3.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 consistently has no visible effect. This observation further supports that ACTION5 repeatedly causes no visible change to the game state. Further observations are needed to determine if it ever has an effect under different conditions, or if it triggers an internal game state change not visible in the frames.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 9: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - pixel at (2,4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - pixel at (2,6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 9 at (50,32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - pixel at (2,8): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - pixel at (2,12): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (32,40)-(33,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (34,40)-(39,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (24,40)-(25,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (26,40)-(31,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,16): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION1 can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to color 9.\n  - The regions affected by ACTION1 can be in the upper right play area as well (e.g., rows 24-39 instead of 32-47).\n  - The specific column for the UI pixel change (e.g., (2,X)) varies with each observation (2, 12, 14 respectively), suggesting it might be dynamic or random, but always changes from 15 to 3.\n  - The coordinates of where existing colors are changed or new blocks appear in the play area can vary for ACTION2.\n  - The column for the UI pixel change in ACTION2 varies; it is always in row 2, and observed columns so far are 4, 12, 14, 16. What drives the column selection is still unknown.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no visible effect in its initial attempts. It is the least explored action with 0 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts. To get initial observations for this action, we must test it immediately. Since we have no verified movement steps we can move the avatar. We will simply test it from the current position to get an initial observation. If it again has no effect, we will know it is likely not position-dependent and will consider new strategies to test it.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a initial observation of ACTION5 (whether it has a visible effect or not). If it has an effect, we will start understanding its functionality. If it doesn't, it will support the theory that it might be an internal state change or context-dependent and we will prioritize trying it from different locations in the future.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and doesn't seem to favor or disfavor any particular action or context for actions like ACTION5, which currently has no known effects."
