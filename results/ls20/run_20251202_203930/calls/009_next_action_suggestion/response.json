  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has no observations yet, making it the highest priority for initial testing. Since no actions are verified, we cannot use any setup sequence to change position. Executing it in the current state is the only option to gain initial observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get the first observation of what ACTION5 does, whether it affects the UI, play area, or both, and whether it introduces new objects or changes existing ones.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various colored blocks and UI elements. Since we don't know what ACTION5 does, this state is as good as any other for a first attempt."
