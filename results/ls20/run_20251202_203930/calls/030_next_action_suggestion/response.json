  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no effect in 3 recent attempts. Since we don't have any verified movement actions yet, and the primary goal is to vary positions when an action has no effect, we prioritize testing an action with no observations (ACTION5 still has 0/3 consistent observations) at the current state. This gives us another data point for ACTION5, and if it still has no effect, it strengthens the hypothesis that it requires a different context or is a 'no-op'. We need to cycle through actions to gather more data points for verification. There are no verified movement actions so we cannot move yet.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe if ACTION5 has any effect in the current state. If it continues to have no effect, it will further validate the 'no effect' observation, guiding future tests to try it in drastically different game states.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely unchanged. There are several colored blocks and UI elements present. Without verified movement, we are limited to testing actions in this state. Since ACTION5 has been observed to have no effect recently, testing it again in the same state is not ideal, but it's the only completely unobserved action. We need to obtain at least one consistent observation for all actions."
