  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no visible effect in its previous 3 attempts, but we still have 0 consistent observations. We need to test it in a variety of states. Since we have no verified movement actions, we must test it in the current state to try and get new information. There are no clear 'bad' conditions for testing ACTION5 as it has consistently had no effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To determine if ACTION5 truly has no visible effect across different states, or if it has a subtle effect we haven't identified yet, or if it might be dependent on a specific, yet unseen, game state.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state features various 8x8 blocks of colors 3, 9, 12, and a dynamic UI. There are no specific conditions that would inhibit ACTION5, given its historical 'no effect' behavior. There aren't any 'bad' conditions that would prevent us from testing this action."
