  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION5.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION5:\n\"ACTION5 consistently has no visible effect. This observation further supports that ACTION5 repeatedly causes no visible change to the game state. Further observations are needed to determine if it ever has an effect under different conditions, or if it triggers an internal game state change not visible in the frames.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (21 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The current game state includes several 8x8 blocks of different colors and pixels in the top UI bar. No specific conditions are present that would obviously trigger a change for ACTION5.\n      Interpretation: The game state remained identical after ACTION5 was taken. This means the action had no visible effect in this instance. The ASCII DIFF shows no changes.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The current game state includes various 8x8 blocks of different colors and pixels in the top UI bar. No specific conditions are present that would obviously trigger a change for ACTION5.\n      Interpretation: The game state remained identical after ACTION5 was taken. This means the action had no visible effect in this instance. The ASCII DIFF shows no changes.\n  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The current game state includes several 8x8 blocks of different colors and pixels in the top UI bar. No specific conditions are present that would obviously trigger a change for ACTION5.\n      Interpretation: The game state remained identical after ACTION5 was taken. This means the action had no visible effect in this instance. The ASCII DIFF shows no changes.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 9: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - pixel at (2,4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - pixel at (2,6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 9 at (50,32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - pixel at (2,8): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - pixel at (2,12): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (32,40)-(33,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (34,40)-(39,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (24,40)-(25,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (26,40)-(31,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,16): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION1 can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to color 9.\n  - The regions affected by ACTION1 can be in the upper right play area as well (e.g., rows 24-39 instead of 32-47).\n  - The specific column for the UI pixel change (e.g., (2,X)) varies with each observation (2, 12, 14 respectively), suggesting it might be dynamic or random, but always changes from 15 to 3.\n  - The coordinates of where existing colors are changed or new blocks appear in the play area can vary for ACTION2.\n  - The column for the UI pixel change in ACTION2 varies; it is always in row 2, and observed columns so far are 4, 12, 14, 16. What drives the column selection is still unknown.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
