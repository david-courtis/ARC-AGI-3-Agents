  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 3 recent no-effect attempts. We need to test it again, but since it had no effect, we must try it from a different position. However, since no actions are verified, we cannot perform a setup sequence. Therefore, we must test ACTION5 again and hope that the state changes enough to reveal its effect, or at least help us progress in verifying other movement actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To determine if ACTION5 truly has no visible effect, or if it has an effect under different, currently unobservable, conditions. If it continues to have no effect, we might re-prioritize it lower, but for now we must exhaust trying it from various 'different' positions (which currently means just trying it fresh due to lack of verified moves).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has a variety of blocks and UI elements, but without verified movement actions, we cannot strategically alter the board state to test actions under different conditions. This limits our ability to move to a 'different position' for actions that previously had no effect. Thus, for ACTION5, we are forced to re-attempt it in a 'new' state, even if we cannot actively cause that new state."
