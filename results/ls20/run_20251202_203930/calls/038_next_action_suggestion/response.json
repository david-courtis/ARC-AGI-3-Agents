  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has had 0 effect across all its attempts, making it the highest priority to test. Since we have no verified actions to create a 'setup sequence', we have to test it in the current state. There were recent 'no-effect' attempts, but since we cannot move the agent, we must try again hoping for contextual changes.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To determine if ACTION5 truly has no effect, or if its effect is highly contextual and depends on a game state we haven't encountered. If it continues to have no effect, we can tentatively mark it as 'no-op'.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board currently contains various 8x8 blocks of different colors and some individual pixels in the UI and play area that could be affected by other actions, but nothing specific that obviously enables ACTION5. The 'no effect' attempts of ACTION5 are critical, meaning we need to change the state somehow if it continues to show no effect. Without verified movement, re-testing ACTION5 is the only immediate option to gather more data on it first, before moving on to less-often-tested actions."
