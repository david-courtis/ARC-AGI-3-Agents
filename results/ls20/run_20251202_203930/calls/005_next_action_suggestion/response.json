  "reasoning": "ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5 have no observations yet, making them the highest priority to test. Since there are no verified actions to use for a setup sequence, and no previous 'no effect' attempts, we should test an unobserved action directly. I'm choosing ACTION3 as the first of the unobserved actions to test.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the fundamental effects of ACTION3, and identify any new objects or UI changes it produces.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board shows various colored blocks and a distinct UI at the top. This state is suitable for testing any unobserved action as we have no specific context requirements for ACTION3 yet."
