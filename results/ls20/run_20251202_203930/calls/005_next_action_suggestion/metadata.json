  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 appears to generate new blocks of pixels in the lower right play area, specifically an 8x8 block of color 9, and two 8x8 blocks of color 3. It also changes any existing color 3 pixels in the (40,40)-(41,47) region to color 12. It also changes any existing color 9 pixels in the (50,40)-(57,47) region to color 3. Additionally, it seems to affect a specific pixel in the top UI, changing it from color 15 to 3.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes specific objects (8x8 blocks) and individual pixels in the play area to change to color 3. It also affects at least one pixel in the top UI but the specific effect on the UI pixel (pixel (2,4) changing from 15 to 3) needs further observation to define.\n  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 9: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - pixel at (2,4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The environment contains dynamic elements that can change colors and appear/disappear.\n  - The UI is a distinct area that can be affected by actions.\n  - ACTION2 can change existing 8x8 blocks of specific colors (12 and 9 observed so far) to color 3.\n  - ACTION2 can change individual existing pixels of specific colors (15 observed so far) to color 3.\n  - The UI is a distinct area that can be affected by ACTION2, specifically a pixel at (2,4) changed color.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5 have no observations yet, making them the highest priority to test. Since there are no verified actions to use for a setup sequence, and no previous 'no effect' attempts, we should test an unobserved action directly. I'm choosing ACTION3 as the first of the unobserved actions to test.",

    "current_board_assessment": "The board shows various colored blocks and a distinct UI at the top. This state is suitable for testing any unobserved action as we have no specific context requirements for ACTION3 yet."
