  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has been attempted multiple times with no effect, indicating it might require a different state or context, or truly has no effect. ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 all have only one observation each and need more validation. Since no movement actions are verified, we cannot strategically alter the position for ACTION5. Therefore, it's best to continue gathering 3 consistent observations for the actions that have shown some effect. ACTION1 is chosen to attempt to get more consistent observations about its behavior in generating and changing pixel blocks, and its UI effect, as it has the least definitive description among the actions with effects.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We hope to see if ACTION1 consistently generates new blocks of specific colors in the same locations and if it consistently changes existing blocks of certain colors in specific regions, and if the UI pixel change is consistent. This observation will help move ACTION1 towards verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board has various colored blocks and shapes. There are no obvious obstructions or conditions that would prevent ACTION1 from potentially exhibiting its documented effects. The UI also has elements that ACTION1 has been observed to interact with."
