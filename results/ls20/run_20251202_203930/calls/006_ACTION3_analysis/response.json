  "interpretation": "A pixel in the top UI changed from color 15 to 3. In the lower right play area, a block of 8x8 pixels of color 3 changed to color 12, and an adjacent 8x8 block of pixels of color 12 changed to color 3. Below that, an 8x8 block of pixels of color 9 changed to color 3. The ASCII diff indicates that the top 8x8 block of color 12 was also changed to color 3, but the pixel changes log shows that portion being color 3 to color 12. This discrepancy is noted.",
  "action_definition": "ACTION3 changes specific pixels or 8x8 blocks of specific colors to other colors. It affects both the UI and the play area. Specifically, it can change a pixel of color 15 in the UI to color 3. In the play area, it appears to interact with 8x8 blocks of colors 3, 12, and 9, performing a color swap between 3 and 12, and changing 9 to 3.",

Based on the pixel changes, it appears two adjacent 8x8 blocks swapped colors (3 and 12), and a block of color 9 below them changed to 3.",
