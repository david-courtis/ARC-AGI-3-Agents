In the lower right play area, a block of 8x8 pixels of color 3 changed to color 12, and an adjacent 8x8 block of pixels of color 12 changed to color 3. Below that, an 8x8 block of pixels of color 9 changed to color 3. The ASCII diff indicates that the top 8x8 block of color 12 was also changed to color 3, but the pixel changes log shows that portion being color 3 to color 12. This discrepancy is noted.",

Specifically, it can change a pixel of color 15 in the UI to color 3.
