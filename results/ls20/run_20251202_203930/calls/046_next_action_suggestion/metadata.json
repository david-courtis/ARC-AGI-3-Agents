  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 seems to affect specific 8x8 blocks in the play area (rows 32-47, columns 40-47), causing color changes. Specifically, it changes color 3 blocks to color 12 in the region (32,40)-(33,47), and color 3 blocks to color 9 in the region (34,40)-(39,47).  It also changes a pixel at (2,12) from color 15 to 3.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes specific objects (8x8 blocks) and individual pixels in the play area to change to color 3. It also affects at least one pixel in the top UI but the specific effect on the UI pixel (pixel (2,4) changing from 15 to 3) needs further observation to define.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 changes specific pixels or 8x8 blocks of specific colors to other colors. It affects both the UI and the play area. Specifically, it can change a pixel of color 15 in the UI to color 3. In the play area, it appears to interact with 8x8 blocks of colors 3, 12, and 9, performing a color swap between 3 and 12, and changing 9 to 3.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 appears to involve a color swapping mechanism within the play area for specific 8x8 blocks, similar to ACTION3. It also causes a change in a UI element, specifically altering the color of a pixel within the top UI bar. Specifically, it swaps 8x8 blocks of colors 3 and 12, and potentially affects blocks of color 9 in the vicinity. The pixel at (2,8) in the UI changes from 15 to 3.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 consistently has no visible effect. This observation further supports that ACTION5 repeatedly causes no visible change to the game state. Further observations are needed to determine if it ever has an effect under different conditions, or if it triggers an internal game state change not visible in the frames.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 9: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - pixel at (2,4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - pixel at (2,6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 9 at (50,32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - pixel at (2,8): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - pixel at (2,12): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (32,40)-(33,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (34,40)-(39,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION4 can cause an 8x8 block of color 3 in the play area to change to color 12.\n  - ACTION4 implicitly affects 8x8 blocks of color 9, either by changing their position or color as part of a larger pattern, similar to ACTION3.\n  - The coordinates of where existing colors are changed or new blocks appear can vary for ACTION1, specifically in the lower right play area.\n  - ACTION1 can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to color 12.\n  - ACTION1 can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to color 9.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no visible effect in its previous 3 attempts. Since there are currently no verified movement actions, the best strategy is to test an action that needs more validation (ACTION5) that has previously shown no effect, and we cannot move the agent to another position. While we cannot guarantee a change in context, it's crucial to continue testing all actions, especially those with minimal observations. Focusing on the actions with the fewest attempts is the priority, and ACTION5 is the only action with 0 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts, so more attempts are critical.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Determine if ACTION5 consistently has no effect, or if its effect is highly context-dependent, or if it triggers an internal game state change not visible in the frames. With more attempts, we might uncover a subtle or rare interaction.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current game state includes several distinct objects and UI elements, providing potential contexts for actions to manifest their effects. While ACTION5 has not caused visible changes so far, the presence of various colored blocks and UI elements means there are multiple potential interaction points if the action has a hidden effect. Since we lack verified movement actions, we must assume the current conditions are as good as any for re-testing actions that showed no prior visible effect."
