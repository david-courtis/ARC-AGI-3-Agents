Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 seems to affect specific 8x8 blocks in the play area (rows 32-47, columns 40-47), causing color changes. Specifically, it changes color 3 blocks to color 12 in the region (32,40)-(33,47), and color 3 blocks to color 9 in the region (34,40)-(39,47).  It also changes a pixel at (2,12) from color 15 to 3."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The game state consists of various colored blocks within a green play area, with a UI element at the top.
      Interpretation: The primary effect of ACTION1 was the appearance of a new 8x8 block of color 9 pixels in the lower right play area (rows 42-49, columns 40-47), which was previously color 3. Additionally, an existing object of color 15 at (2,2) changed to color 3, and two 8x8 blocks of color 3 appeared at (50,40)-(57,47), where previously color 9. Another two 8x8 blocks of color 12 appeared at (40,40)-(41,47) where previously color 3. The top UI also changed a single pixel from color 15 to color 3.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game state consists of various colored blocks within a green play area, with a UI element at the top. Before the action, there was a pixel of color 15 at (2,12). There were also several 8x8 blocks of color 3 in the lower right play area.
      Interpretation: The action caused a pixel at (2,12) to change from color 15 to 3. In the play area, two 8x8 blocks of color 3 at (32,40)-(33,47) changed to color 12. Also, two 8x8 blocks of color 3 at (34,40)-(39,47) changed to color 9. Another two 8x8 blocks of color 3 at (40,40)-(47,47) remained color 3. The specific regions mentioned in previous observations (40,40)-(41,47) and (50,40)-(57,47) were not affected as previously described in their entirety. Instead, the changes occurred in rows 32-47 and columns 40-47.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 9: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - pixel at (2,4): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - pixel at (2,6): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 9 at (50,32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - pixel at (2,8): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - pixel at (2,12): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (32,40)-(33,47): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (34,40)-(39,47): Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION4 can cause an 8x8 block of color 3 in the play area to change to color 12.
  - ACTION4 implicitly affects 8x8 blocks of color 9, either by changing their position or color as part of a larger pattern, similar to ACTION3.
  - The coordinates of where existing colors are changed or new blocks appear can vary for ACTION1, specifically in the lower right play area.
  - ACTION1 can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to color 12.
  - ACTION1 can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to color 9.
