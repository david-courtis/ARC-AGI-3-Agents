  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 3 recent no-effect attempts, so it must be tested from a new state. Since no actions are verified yet, it is critical to try to verify an action that can act as a setup move. ACTION1 has the most verbose description and appears to create new blocks, which could be useful for future tests. Using ACTION1 three times is an attempt to verify it. After executing ACTION1 three times, the board state will have changed, allowing for a re-test of ACTION5 in a new context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify ACTION1 by observing its effect three times. Then, test ACTION5 in a new state to try and discover its function, or at least confirm if the 'no effect' is persistent across different states.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board is largely green with a few small purple, black, yellow, and cyan elements. There are no readily apparent 'objects' or 'targets' for actions like 'interact', which might be why some actions have no effect. A dynamic board, potentially with more varied pixel arrangements through repeated ACTION1 execution, would be beneficial for further testing."
