Analyze the effect of action ACTION2.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION2:
"ACTION2 causes specific objects (8x8 blocks) and individual pixels in the play area to change to color 3. It also affects at least one pixel in the top UI but the specific effect on the UI pixel (pixel (2,4) changing from 15 to 3) needs further observation to define."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: Prior to ACTION2, the lower right section of the play area contained 8x8 blocks of color 12 and color 9. The top UI element had a pixel of color 15 at (2,4).
      Interpretation: A group of 8x8 blocks of color 12 and 9 changed to color 3. A single pixel at (2,4) also changed from color 15 to color 3. The change happened in the lower right part of the play area and affected a small part of the top UI.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 9: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - pixel at (2,4): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - pixel at (2,6): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 9 at (50,32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - pixel at (2,8): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - pixel at (2,12): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (32,40)-(33,47): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (34,40)-(39,47): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - pixel at (2,14): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (24,40)-(25,47): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (26,40)-(31,47): Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - The coordinates of where existing colors are changed or new blocks appear can vary for ACTION1, specifically in the lower right play area.
  - ACTION1 can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to color 12.
  - ACTION1 can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to color 9.
  - The regions affected by ACTION1 can be in the upper right play area as well (e.g., rows 24-39 instead of 32-47).
  - The specific column for the UI pixel change (e.g., (2,X)) varies with each observation (2, 12, 14 respectively), suggesting it might be dynamic or random, but always changes from 15 to 3.

FRAME CHANGES:
Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_right_playarea (64), lower_right_playarea (64), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-39], cols [16-47]
