  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not had any consistent effects observed, and has had 3 recent 'no effect' attempts. Since there are no verified movement actions, we cannot perform a setup sequence to change the position. Therefore, we must test ACTION5 again in the current state to continue gathering data. It is crucial to determine if `ACTION5` ever has an effect or if it's truly a 'no-op'. We are also prioritizing actions with the fewest attempts for initial observation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We will learn if ACTION5 can ever have a visible effect, given more attempts, or if it consistently produces no visible change. This will help understand if it's a 'no-op' or if its effects are context-dependent and we just haven't found the right context yet.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic enough for testing ACTION5, as its previous attempts had 'no effect' regardless of board specifics. Since no verified movement actions exist, we cannot strategically alter the board state anyway."
