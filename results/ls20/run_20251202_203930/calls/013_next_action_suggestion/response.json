  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 0 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts, making it the highest priority for initial testing. Since there are no verified actions, a setup sequence is not possible or necessary. Given ACTION5 has not been attempted at all, there's no 'no-effect' history to necessitate a state change.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get the first observation for ACTION5 to start understanding its behavior. Given its description 'appears to be an action that can sometimes have no visible effect,' even a 'no effect' observation would be valuable for initial data collection.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic enough for an initial test of an action that has never been tried. Without any specific environmental requirements for ACTION5, any state is suitable for the first attempt to gather data."
