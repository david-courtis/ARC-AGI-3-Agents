  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been observed even once, making it the highest priority for initial observation. While it has had no effect in recent attempts, there are no verified movement actions to guarantee a different position, so testing it in the current state is the most efficient choice to get a first observation. This decision prioritizes discovery of a completely unknown action over validating partially observed actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "A first observation of ACTION5's effect, or confirmation that it consistently has no effect in this current game state.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board appears to contain various 8x8 blocks of colors 3, 9, 12, and some individual pixels in the UI bar and play area. It presents a good opportunity to observe if ACTION5 interacts with any of these elements."
