  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been observed at all, making it the highest priority for initial testing. Although it had recent 'no effect' attempts, those attempts were from previous states. Since no verified actions are available for a setup sequence, we must test ACTION5 from the current position. If it remains 'no effect' we will prioritize changing position using other actions once they are verified.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Determine if ACTION5 ever has a visible effect, or if it consistently has no visible effect, indicating it might trigger internal state changes or is condition-dependent. This will also provide an initial observation count for ACTION5.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely a green background with some distinct colored larger blocks and smaller pixels. There are no obvious immediate obstacles or specific elements that would prevent any action from being tested from this position. The presence of varied colored blocks and pixels might be relevant for actions that affect their colors or positions, but for a wholly unobserved action like ACTION5, initial testing can proceed from any state."
