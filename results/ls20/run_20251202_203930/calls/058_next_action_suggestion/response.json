  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently shown 'no effect' and has had 3 recent no-effect attempts. Since none of the actions are verified for movement, we cannot move the agent. Therefore, the best strategy is to re-attempt ACTION5 given that no movement is possible and we need more validation attempts for it. If it continues to show no effect, we can strongly conclude it has no visible effect, or its effect is internal/conditional.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further attempts to confirm if ACTION5 truly has no visible effect in this game state, or if its effect is extremely subtle or conditional on a different game state that we cannot currently reach. This will increase confidence in our understanding of ACTION5's behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board shows various colored blocks and a UI. Since no movement actions are verified, we are stuck in the current position for testing all actions. The current state has all the elements involved in the previously observed actions (8x8 blocks of colors 3, 9, 12, and the changing UI pixel of color 15). These elements are present, so the board is suitable for testing without assuming specific object proximity for most actions, especially for ACTION5 which has had no effect regardless of board state."
