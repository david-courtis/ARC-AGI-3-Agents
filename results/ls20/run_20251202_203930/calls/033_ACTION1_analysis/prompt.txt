Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 appears to generate new blocks of pixels in the lower right play area, specifically an 8x8 block of color 9, and two 8x8 blocks of color 3. It also changes any existing color 3 pixels in the (40,40)-(41,47) region to color 12. It also changes any existing color 9 pixels in the (50,40)-(57,47) region to color 3. Additionally, it seems to affect a specific pixel in the top UI, changing it from color 15 to 3."

  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The game state consists of various colored blocks within a green play area, with a UI element at the top.
      Interpretation: The primary effect of ACTION1 was the appearance of a new 8x8 block of color 9 pixels in the lower right play area (rows 42-49, columns 40-47), which was previously color 3. Additionally, an existing object of color 15 at (2,2) changed to color 3, and two 8x8 blocks of color 3 appeared at (50,40)-(57,47), where previously color 9. Another two 8x8 blocks of color 12 appeared at (40,40)-(41,47) where previously color 3. The top UI also changed a single pixel from color 15 to color 3.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 9: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - pixel at (2,4): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - pixel at (2,6): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 9 at (50,32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - pixel at (2,8): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - It is possible that ACTION3 performs a color swapping mechanic for specific colors (e.g., 3 and 12) between adjacent blocks.
  - ACTION4 can change the color of a pixel in the top UI bar from 15 to 3.
  - ACTION4 can cause an 8x8 block of color 12 in the play area to change to color 3.
  - ACTION4 can cause an 8x8 block of color 3 in the play area to change to color 12.
  - ACTION4 implicitly affects 8x8 blocks of color 9, either by changing their position or color as part of a larger pattern, similar to ACTION3.
