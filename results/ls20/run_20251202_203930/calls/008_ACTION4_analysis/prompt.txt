Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

This is the FIRST time observing this action.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 9: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - pixel at (2,4): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - pixel at (2,6): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 9 at (50,32): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION3 can change an 8x8 block of color 3 in the play area to color 12.
  - ACTION3 can change an 8x8 block of color 12 in the play area to color 3.
  - ACTION3 can change an 8x8 block of color 9 in the play area to color 3.
  - There is an observed discrepancy between the ASCII DIFF and the pixel changes list for the color at (48,40) and surrounding points: ASCII diff shows 12->3, while the pixel change log shows 3->12 and 12->3 simultaneously for corresponding positions. Based on the pixel changes, it appears two adjacent 8x8 blocks swapped colors (3 and 12), and a block of color 9 below them changed to 3.
  - It is possible that ACTION3 performs a color swapping mechanic for specific colors (e.g., 3 and 12) between adjacent blocks.

FRAME CHANGES:
Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-55], cols [8-47]
