  "interpretation": "When ACTION4 was taken, the pixel at (2,8) in the top UI changed from color 15 to color 3. In the play area, a large block of color 12 (8x8 pixels) at (48,32) changed to color 3. An adjacent 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,40) changed to color 12. Approximately an 8x8 block of color 9 remained at (50,40), while the 8x8 block of color 9 that was previously at (50,32) has moved/changed.",
  "action_definition": "ACTION4 appears to involve a color swapping mechanism within the play area for specific 8x8 blocks, similar to ACTION3. It also causes a change in a UI element, specifically altering the color of a pixel within the top UI bar. Specifically, it swaps 8x8 blocks of colors 3 and 12, and potentially affects blocks of color 9 in the vicinity. The pixel at (2,8) in the UI changes from 15 to 3.",
