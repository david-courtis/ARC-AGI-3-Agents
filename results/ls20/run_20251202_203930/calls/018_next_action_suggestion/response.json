  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 0/3 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts, making it the highest priority for initial testing as it's an unobserved action. All other actions have been attempted at least once. Since there are no verified actions yet, a setup sequence is not possible. Also, ACTION5 had no recent 'no-effect' attempts, so we don't need to try and change position first based on that criteria.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Testing ACTION5 for the first time will provide initial observations about what it does or if it consistently produces no effect. This is crucial for beginning to define its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has a variety of colors and objects that may interact with different actions. Since we have no specific context for WHERE ACTION5 needs to be tested, it is reasonable to try it in the current, default state."
