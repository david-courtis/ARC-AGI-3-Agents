  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has the highest priority because its definition is the most detailed and it affects clear regions of the play area. It has also been attempted 8 times, which shows many observations. The recent observations specify that the coordinates for ACTION1 can vary and it can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to either color 12 or 9. Given the current game state, there are many 8x8 blocks of color 3 present, especially in the central play area and the bottom left corner. This seems to be a good state to test ACTION1 to see how it interacts with these existing blocks and if new blocks appear or if existing colors are changed. There are no identified conflicts with the current game state. We prioritize actions with more detail as they are closer to being verified.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe which specific 8x8 blocks of color 3 are affected by ACTION1 in this current configuration. We want to confirm if it continues to change color 3 blocks to color 12 or 9 in its defined regions, or if it has new effects. We also want to observe if the pixel at (2,12) changes from color 15 to 3 as previously noted. This will help us get closer to verifying ACTION1.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game board contains several 8x8 blocks of color 3, which are identified as being involved in ACTION1's effects (changing color 3 to 12 or 9). There are also UI elements that ACTION1 has been observed to affect. This state seems suitable for testing ACTION1 directly without a setup sequence."
