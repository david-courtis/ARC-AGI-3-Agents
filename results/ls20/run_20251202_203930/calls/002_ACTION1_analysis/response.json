Additionally, an existing object of color 15 at (2,2) changed to color 3, and two 8x8 blocks of color 3 appeared at (50,40)-(57,47), where previously color 9. Another two 8x8 blocks of color 12 appeared at (40,40)-(41,47) where previously color 3. The top UI also changed a single pixel from color 15 to color 3.",
