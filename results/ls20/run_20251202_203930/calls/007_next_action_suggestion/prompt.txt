Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 appears to generate new blocks of pixels in the lower right play area, specifically an 8x8 block of color 9, and two 8x8 blocks of color 3. It also changes any existing color 3 pixels in the (40,40)-(41,47) region to color 12. It also changes any existing color 9 pixels in the (50,40)-(57,47) region to color 3. Additionally, it seems to affect a specific pixel in the top UI, changing it from color 15 to 3.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes specific objects (8x8 blocks) and individual pixels in the play area to change to color 3. It also affects at least one pixel in the top UI but the specific effect on the UI pixel (pixel (2,4) changing from 15 to 3) needs further observation to define.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 changes specific pixels or 8x8 blocks of specific colors to other colors. It affects both the UI and the play area. Specifically, it can change a pixel of color 15 in the UI to color 3. In the play area, it appears to interact with 8x8 blocks of colors 3, 12, and 9, performing a color swap between 3 and 12, and changing 9 to 3.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 8x8 block of color 9: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - pixel at (2,4): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - pixel at (2,6): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - 8x8 block of color 9 at (50,32): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION3 can change an 8x8 block of color 3 in the play area to color 12.
  - ACTION3 can change an 8x8 block of color 12 in the play area to color 3.
  - ACTION3 can change an 8x8 block of color 9 in the play area to color 3.
  - There is an observed discrepancy between the ASCII DIFF and the pixel changes list for the color at (48,40) and surrounding points: ASCII diff shows 12->3, while the pixel change log shows 3->12 and 12->3 simultaneously for corresponding positions. Based on the pixel changes, it appears two adjacent 8x8 blocks swapped colors (3 and 12), and a block of color 9 below them changed to 3.
  - It is possible that ACTION3 performs a color swapping mechanic for specific colors (e.g., 3 and 12) between adjacent blocks.
