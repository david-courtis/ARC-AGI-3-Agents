  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 and ACTION5 have no observations yet, making them the highest priority for testing. Since all previous actions resulted in some effect, there is no need for a setup sequence due to a 'no effect' observation. Testing ACTION4 next aligns with systematic exploration of unknown actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To gain initial observations of what ACTION4 does, including any changes to the play area, UI, or specific objects. This will help us start defining its effects and identifying relevant objects/pixels.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state appears neutral and suitable for testing a completely new action. There are various colored blocks and UI elements present, which might be affected by an unknown action."
