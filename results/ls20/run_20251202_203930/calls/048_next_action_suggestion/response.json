  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently shown no effect over multiple attempts. While this might indicate it truly has no effect, it is more likely that its effects are highly contextual or internally state-changing. To rule out the 'no effect' possibility under varying conditions, we need to test it from different positions. Since no movement actions are yet verified, we cannot use a setup sequence. Therefore, we must test ACTION5 as is, and prioritize attempting to verify any movement actions as soon as possible before returning to ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe if ACTION5 ever has an effect under the current conditions, or if it continues to have no visible effect, reinforcing the need for varied positions or an internal state change hypothesis.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely static with some visual elements. The most prominent elements are various 8x8 blocks of colors 3, 9, 12, and an object that looks like a hat. The UI elements remain consistent. Without verified movement actions, the current position is our only testing ground."
