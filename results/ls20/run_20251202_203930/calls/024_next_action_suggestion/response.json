  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been observed even once, making it the highest priority for initial testing. Although it had no effect in recent attempts, we are in a new state and since no verified actions exist, we must prioritize testing unobserved actions. We need to get some initial data on what it might do.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get a first observation of what ACTION5 does, or to confirm it consistently produces no effect in this state. This will allow us to start defining its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state offers a visual spread of distinct elements (various 8x8 blocks of different colors and positions, UI elements), which is generally good for observing the initial effects of an unknown action. There isn't a specific 'bad' position for testing an unknown action like ACTION5, as its primary behavior is yet to be determined."
