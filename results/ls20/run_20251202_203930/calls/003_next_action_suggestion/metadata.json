It also changes any existing color 3 pixels in the (40,40)-(41,47) region to color 12. It also changes any existing color 9 pixels in the (50,40)-(57,47) region to color 3. Additionally, it seems to affect a specific pixel in the top UI, changing it from color 15 to 3.\n  ACTION2: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The environment contains dynamic elements that can change colors and appear/disappear.\n  - The UI is a distinct area that can be affected by actions.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",
