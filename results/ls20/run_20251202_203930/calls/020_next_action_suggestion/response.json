  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in previous attempts. Since no actions are yet verified, I cannot construct a setup sequence to change the position. Therefore, the best strategy is to re-attempt ACTION5 in the current state to hopefully reveal some effect or to get more 'no effect' results, enabling us to move it further down the priority list.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe any effect from ACTION5, which currently shows 'no effect'. If it shows no effect again, it further corroborates its 'no effect' nature.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic, which is suitable for testing an action that has shown no effect previously. Without verified movement actions, we cannot strategically alter the board state."
