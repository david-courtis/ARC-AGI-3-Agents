  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no observable effect in the last 3 attempts, and since no actions are verified, we cannot move the agent to a different position. The current state has various colored blocks and UI elements, which might provide context for ACTION5 to have an effect. Without verified movement actions, the best strategy is to re-test an action that previously had no effect in the current state to confirm if it truly has no effect or if we just missed something, hoping for a different outcome this time. If it still has no effect, we will need to prioritize verifying some movement actions first to enable position changes.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To determine if ACTION5 truly has no effect in this specific state, or if its effect is subtle and was missed, or if it might trigger an internal state change. Any observable change would be significant, as its definition currently states 'consistently has no visible effect'.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game board is currently complex with various colored blocks and shapes, and a detailed UI. This state is suitable for testing any action that might interact with these elements. While ideally, we'd move after a no-effect attempt, the lack of verified movement actions prevents this strategy."
