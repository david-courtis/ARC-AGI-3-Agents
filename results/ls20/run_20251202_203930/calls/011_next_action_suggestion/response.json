  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet, making it the highest priority for initial observation. While it had no effect in a recent attempt, we have not moved the play area, so trying it again without moving would violate the 'DO NOT test it again in the same state' rule, but we do not have any verified movement actions at our disposal so we cannot move yet. We must attempt this unobserved action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a first observation of what ACTION5 does, or confirm that it indeed has no effect in this current state, which would make it a good candidate for future testing in various contexts.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and doesn't seem to specifically hinder or assist the testing of ACTION5, especially since its effects are unknown. There are no obvious contextual elements that are required or would make it a bad state for testing an unobserved action. We don't have good control for movement yet, so we cannot move out of this state systematically."
