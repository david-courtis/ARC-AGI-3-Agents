  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "All actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) have had one attempt each. ACTION5 has had zero attempts but multiple 'no effect' observations. Since there are no VERIFIED ACTIONS yet, we cannot use a setup sequence. The highest priority is to test actions that have never been observed to try and get an initial observation. Therefore, ACTION5, which has 0/8 attempts, should be tested first to gather an initial observation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "An initial observation of ACTION5 to understand its basic effect, or to confirm if it truly has no effect in this current state.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various 8x8 blocks of colors 3, 9, 12, and some individual pixels in the UI that previous actions have affected. While we don't know what ACTION5 does, the current state offers a variety of elements that other actions interact with, making it a reasonable starting point for a brand new action investigation."
