  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "Since all actions have 'NO OBSERVATIONS YET', the highest priority is to test an unobserved action. ACTION1 is chosen as the first in the list. There are no recent 'NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS' and no verified actions, so a setup sequence is not possible or necessary at this stage. We must start observing the effects of actions from the current position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the initial effect of ACTION1. This could be movement, interaction with an object, or a change in the environment. This will provide the first piece of information for ACTION1's behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows a distinct green background with some rectangular shapes (lighter green and solid green). There's a yellow/black object, a black/purple object, and a cyan/purple object. The current position is in an open area, which is suitable for testing basic actions without immediate obstruction."
