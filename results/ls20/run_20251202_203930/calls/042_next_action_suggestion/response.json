  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no visible effect in 3 recent attempts. Since we have no verified movement actions, we must re-test ACTION5 in the current state to confirm if it truly has no effect or if its effect is very subtle/context-dependent, even though it goes against the rule to not test in the same state if a 'no effect' has occurred. We also need to gather more data on all actions as none are verified. Prioritizing unobserved/least observed actions is key. However, since all actions have at least one observation, we focus on the one with no consistent effect, starting with the one that was recently attempted without effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further confirmation of whether ACTION5 always has no visible effect, or if it has a subtle effect that we've missed, or if it triggers an internal state change. Any observation, even 'no effect', counts as data to move towards verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains various colored blocks and UI elements that have been affected by other actions. Since ACTION5 is not yet linked to any specific environmental context, testing it from the current position is as good as any other, given the lack of verified movement to alter the state. It might interact with the existing color blocks or UI elements."
