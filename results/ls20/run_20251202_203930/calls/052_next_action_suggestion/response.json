{
  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has only 1 attempt and needs further validation. The current state contains an 8x8 block of color 9 and an 8x8 block of color 12, both of which are mentioned in ACTION2's definition as being involved. This makes the current state suitable for testing ACTION2. Additionally, there are no verified actions to move with, so we cannot perform a setup sequence even if we wanted to change the position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a second observation of ACTION2's effect, particularly on the 8x8 blocks of color 9 and 12, and the pixel at (2,4). This will help us confirm or refine its definition and move towards its verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing ACTION2 because it contains objects (8x8 blocks of color 9 and 12) that ACTION2 is known to affect. There are also visible UI elements, which are relevant for observing changes to pixel (2,4)."
