  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 systematically affects 8x8 blocks in the play area (rows 24-39, columns 40-47), causing color changes. Specifically, it changes color 3 blocks to color 12 in the region (24,40)-(25,47), and color 3 blocks to color 9 in the region (26,40)-(31,47). It also changes a pixel at (2,X) from color 15 to 3, where X is 2, 12, or 14.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes specific objects (8x8 blocks) and individual pixels in the play area to change to color 3. It also affects at least one pixel in the top UI but the specific effect on the UI pixel (pixel (2,4) changing from 15 to 3) needs further observation to define.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 changes specific pixels or 8x8 blocks of specific colors to other colors. It affects both the UI and the play area. Specifically, it can change a pixel of color 15 in the UI to color 3. In the play area, it appears to interact with 8x8 blocks of colors 3, 12, and 9, performing a color swap between 3 and 12, and changing 9 to 3.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 appears to involve a color swapping mechanism within the play area for specific 8x8 blocks, similar to ACTION3. It also causes a change in a UI element, specifically altering the color of a pixel within the top UI bar. Specifically, it swaps 8x8 blocks of colors 3 and 12, and potentially affects blocks of color 9 in the vicinity. The pixel at (2,8) in the UI changes from 15 to 3.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 consistently has no visible effect. This observation further supports that ACTION5 repeatedly causes no visible change to the game state. Further observations are needed to determine if it ever has an effect under different conditions, or if it triggers an internal game state change not visible in the frames.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - 8x8 block of color 9 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 3 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 blocks of color 12 (newly appeared): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,2): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - top UI element: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 9: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - pixel at (2,4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - pixel at (2,6): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 9 at (50,32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - pixel at (2,8): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 12 at (48,32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (48,40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - pixel at (2,12): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (32,40)-(33,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (34,40)-(39,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - pixel at (2,14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (24,40)-(25,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - 8x8 block of color 3 at (26,40)-(31,47): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The coordinates of where existing colors are changed or new blocks appear can vary for ACTION1, specifically in the lower right play area.\n  - ACTION1 can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to color 12.\n  - ACTION1 can change 8x8 blocks of color 3 to color 9.\n  - The regions affected by ACTION1 can be in the upper right play area as well (e.g., rows 24-39 instead of 32-47).\n  - The specific column for the UI pixel change (e.g., (2,X)) varies with each observation (2, 12, 14 respectively), suggesting it might be dynamic or random, but always changes from 15 to 3.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 has only 1 attempt and needs further validation. The current state contains an 8x8 block of color 9 and an 8x8 block of color 12, both of which are mentioned in ACTION2's definition as being involved. This makes the current state suitable for testing ACTION2. Additionally, there are no verified actions to move with, so we cannot perform a setup sequence even if we wanted to change the position.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a second observation of ACTION2's effect, particularly on the 8x8 blocks of color 9 and 12, and the pixel at (2,4). This will help us confirm or refine its definition and move towards its verification.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing ACTION2 because it contains objects (8x8 blocks of color 9 and 12) that ACTION2 is known to affect. There are also visible UI elements, which are relevant for observing changes to pixel (2,4)."
