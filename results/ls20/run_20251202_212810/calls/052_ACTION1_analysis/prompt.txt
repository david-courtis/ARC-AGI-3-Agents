Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 moves one or more selected objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). If a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) is located at (32,32) and other objects are moved 'up', this specific 2x2 block will disappear."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (5 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (16, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (18, 24).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24) moved upwards to (15,24). A Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24) also moved upwards to (17,24).
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 40).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved up to (47,40), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved up to (49,40).
  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (42, 32). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved up to (39,32). A Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) also moved up to (41,32). Concurrently, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) disappeared.

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION5 can cause a complete game reset, including new object generation and UI changes, if no specific interaction context is present.
  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no selected object'.
  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) suggests that objects of type Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at location (32,32) might be 'triggers' or automatically removed under certain conditions, specifically when ACTION1 is performed and other objects are moved upwards. This is a newly observed interaction and overrides the previous idea of selection for ACTION1.
  - ACTION2 can also cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move down, although the conditions for this appearance are unknown.
