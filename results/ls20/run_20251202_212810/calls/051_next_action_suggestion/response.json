  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has 0/3 consistent observations and 5/8 attempts, making it a high priority for further validation. Although it had a recent effect, the definition for ACTION1 is very specific regarding the disappearance of a Color 9 block at (32,32). We need to verify if this behavior is consistent and under what precise conditions the object disappears. The current state has multiple objects, giving it a good setup to test movement actions. There is no indication that the current state is bad for testing ACTION1. Unlike ACTION5, ACTION1 hasn't had any 'no effect' attempts recently, so a setup sequence is not strictly necessary for it.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify if ACTION1 consistently moves objects 'up' and specifically confirm the conditions for the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) to disappear. We need to observe if the objects mentioned in the definition (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)) actually move 'up' and how this relates to the 'disappearance' of the specific 2x2 block.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board appears to contain multiple movable objects, including some that have been identified in previous ACTION1 effects (e.g., Color 12 rectangular block (8x2), Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)). This state is suitable for testing spatial manipulation actions like ACTION1. There is no immediate object at (32,32) matching the description for the disappearing block, so we are also testing for the broader movement behavior of ACTION1."
