  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 8/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). The presence and movement of other objects specifically impacts whether a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) appears, disappears, or remains.\n  ACTION2: VERIFIED - ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 usually moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left. However, sometimes, it triggers a game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, similar to ACTION5 under certain, yet to be fully understood, conditions. When a game reset occurs, the objects that were 'selected' or 'involved' in the reset might also undergo a movement transformation as they appear in the new state.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided (and likely also when no game reset condition is met), has no effect. The specific conditions under which it acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action are still undefined but are more complex than simply the absence of a selected object.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 5 8x8 shape: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 3x3 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The general movement down of the two larger blocks is consistent with the 'Move DOWN' interpretation of ACTION2.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when ACTION4 is executed is context-dependent and does not always occur.\n  - The movement of specified blocks is consistent with the 'Move RIGHT' interpretation of ACTION4.\n  - ACTION3 can, under certain conditions, trigger a full game reset, similar to how ACTION5 sometimes does.\n  - During a game reset caused by ACTION3, not only do existing objects disappear and new ones appear, but the objects that were 'involved' might also undergo a movement transformation as part of their reappearance on the new board.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION2\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "setup_sequence": [],
    "reasoning": "ACTION1 has 0/3 consistent observations and 8 attempts. It has not had a no-effect observation recently. The description of ACTION1 suggests it moves objects 'up' and affects the appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block at (32,32). There is a Color 9 block at (32,32) on the current board, which provides a good context to test ACTION1 and potentially observe its effect on this object and its interaction with other objects.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to gain more consistent observations for ACTION1, specifically how it interacts with the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32), and other visible objects (the 8x2 Color 12 block and the 8x6 Color 9 block, both at (32,32) based on the image and descriptions), and to confirm its 'move up' functionality.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32,32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) also at (32,32), along with a smaller Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32). This state seems conducive for testing ACTION1, which is related to these objects and this specific coordinate, potentially moving them up or causing the 2x2 block to appear/disappear. Therefore, no setup sequence is immediately needed."
