  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has had 7 no-effect attempts, including the last 6 actions. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different state before retesting an action that recently had no effect. ACTION2 is the only fully verified movement action, so it is used twice to ensure a significant change in position. After moving, we can re-test ACTION4.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe if ACTION4, after a change in board state, will either perform its expected rightward movement or trigger a game reset, and if the potential side effect of the Color 9 block appearing at (32,32) occurs. This will help us gain more consistent observations for ACTION4 and better understand its conditions for effect and reset.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has led to multiple no-effect outcomes for ACTION4. Without changing the state, it's highly likely ACTION4 would continue to have no effect. A setup sequence is necessary to alter the environment and potentially allow ACTION4 to exhibit its designed behavior."
