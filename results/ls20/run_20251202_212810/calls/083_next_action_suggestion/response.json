  "reasoning": "ACTION4 had no effect in the previous state. According to the rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying a no-effect action. ACTION2 is the only VERIFIED movement action, so we will use it twice to significantly change the position of selected objects. After moving, we will re-test ACTION4 to see if the new position yields a different outcome or helps us understand the reset conditions better.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION4 after a setup sequence, we aim to confirm whether its 'no effect' was state-dependent and if a new state can trigger its effect or a game reset. Specifically, we are looking to observe object movement or a reset, which would provide more data towards understanding ACTION4's conditions and ultimately verifying it. We also hope to learn more about the conditions that lead to a game reset or the specific movement of objects when ACTION4 is performed after a positional change.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board features several shapes and colors. Key objects include a gold and black structure, a small purple and black object, and some light blue and purple shapes in the bottom right, along with black L-shapes in the bottom left. The previous ACTION4 resulted in 'NO EFFECT', indicating that the current state is not conducive for its regular operation or that a specific interaction point/object might be missing or not activated. The goal is to move the presumed 'selected' or 'operable' objects to a new position to see if the functionality changes when ACTION4 is applied."
