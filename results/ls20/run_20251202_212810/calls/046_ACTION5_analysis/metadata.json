  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION5.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION5:\n\"ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided, usually has no effect. However, under certain (as yet undefined) conditions, it can act as a 'reset' or 'new game' action, clearing the previous game state and generating a new one with various new objects and a changed UI.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (12 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (50, 40) in a predominantly orange background. There were no explicit indicators of selection or interaction points.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, the entire game state reset. All previous objects disappeared, and many new objects appeared, including a large background object and several smaller blocks/shapes. The UI elements also changed significantly. This suggests ACTION5 acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action when no specific object or interaction point is active.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40). No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This is after a game reset in the previous context for ACTION5.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [3] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 48). No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 can cause a complete game reset, including new object generation and UI changes, if no specific interaction context is present.\n  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no selected object'.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
