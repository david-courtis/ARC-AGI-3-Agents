  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has had multiple recent 'NO EFFECT' attempts, and according to the rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying it. ACTION2 is the only fully verified movement action. Moving twice with ACTION2 will ensure a significant change in position from where ACTION4 previously had no effect. ACTION4 also has zero consistent observations, making it a high priority for validation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION4 after a clear positional change, we aim to: 1. See if the no-effect outcome was due to the previous state. 2. Observe if ACTION4 now causes selected blocks to move right. 3. Further investigate the conditions under which ACTION4 triggers a game reset or the appearance of the Color 9 block at (32,32).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is not ideal for testing ACTION4, especially since it previously resulted in no effect. A change in position is necessary to gather new information about ACTION4's behavior. There are several movable blocks that could potentially be affected by ACTION4 if it functions as a 'move right' action."
