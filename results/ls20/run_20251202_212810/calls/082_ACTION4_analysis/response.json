The context indicates a Color 12 block (8x2) at (48, 48) and a Color 9 block (8x6) at (50, 48) were present, but they did not move. This implies either they are not 'selected' or 'movable', or there's an obstruction, or the boundary of the play area prevented movement. Since the previous analysis already noted a 'no effect' instance for ACTION4, it reinforces that not all objects always respond to movement actions.",
