  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:\n\"ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). Under certain, currently unknown, conditions, ACTION4 can trigger a full game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, and the two affected blocks to reappear with a movement transformation (right movement combined with an 'appearance' effect for the new board). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (7 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (24, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (26, 48). Other various blocks and shapes were present. No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (32, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (34, 40).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 40) moved right to (32,41) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 40) moved right to (34,41). No other object appeared or disappeared in this instance.\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 40). The background was predominantly green, with other blocks and shapes present. After the reset, the background is orange and a new set of objects are present.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved right to (48,41) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved right to (50,41). No other object appeared or disappeared in this instance. The background changed from green to orange along with other UI elements, similar to a game 'reset'.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 5 8x8 shape: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 3x3 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 52): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (18, 34): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (3x3) at (54, 1): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 12: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 17: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 22: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 27: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 32: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 37: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 42: Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - During a game reset caused by ACTION3, not only do existing objects disappear and new ones appear, but the objects that were 'involved' might also undergo a movement transformation as part of their reappearance on the new board.\n  - ACTION1 can also act as a full game reset under certain conditions.\n  - The conditions for ACTION1 triggering a game reset are currently unknown.\n  - ACTION4 can sometimes trigger a full game reset, similar to ACTION1 and ACTION3, and specific instances of ACTION5. The conditions for this full game reset are still unknown.\n  - When a full game reset occurs, objects that were present before the reset may reappear in transformed positions as part of the new game state (i.e., a 'moved' state after reset).\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
