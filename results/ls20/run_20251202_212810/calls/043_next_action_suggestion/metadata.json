However, in certain contexts, it can also cause other adjacent objects to disappear or be 'destroyed'.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided, acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action, clearing the previous game state and generating a new one with various new objects and a changed UI.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 can cause a complete game reset, including new object generation and UI changes, if no specific interaction context is present.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has shown no effect in recent attempts from the current state. The critical rule states that if an action had no effect, it should not be tested again in the same state. Therefore, a setup sequence is required to move to a different position. Since no actions are yet verified, I will use ACTION2 and ACTION4 which have at least shown 'effect' in previous attempts, to change the state. The goal is to retry ACTION5 from a new position to see if the context changes its behavior, specifically trying to trigger its 'reset' or 'new game' effect which was observed once.",
    "expected_information_gain": "To validate whether the 'reset' behavior of ACTION5 is context-dependent or if the previous 'no effect' was due to insufficient movement between trials, or other state dependencies. Specifically, if moving the pieces around changes whether ACTION5 causes a reset or interaction.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The board currently has multiple colored blocks. The 'no effect' observations for ACTION5 suggest that the current configuration might not be conducive to its 'reset' behavior unless certain internal conditions are met or it's not near a specific interactable object. A movement sequence will change the position of the movable blocks and hopefully, the overall game state."
