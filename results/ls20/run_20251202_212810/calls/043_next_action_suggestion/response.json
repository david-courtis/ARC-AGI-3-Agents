  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has shown no effect in recent attempts from the current state. The critical rule states that if an action had no effect, it should not be tested again in the same state. Therefore, a setup sequence is required to move to a different position. Since no actions are yet verified, I will use ACTION2 and ACTION4 which have at least shown 'effect' in previous attempts, to change the state. The goal is to retry ACTION5 from a new position to see if the context changes its behavior, specifically trying to trigger its 'reset' or 'new game' effect which was observed once.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To validate whether the 'reset' behavior of ACTION5 is context-dependent or if the previous 'no effect' was due to insufficient movement between trials, or other state dependencies. Specifically, if moving the pieces around changes whether ACTION5 causes a reset or interaction.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board currently has multiple colored blocks. The 'no effect' observations for ACTION5 suggest that the current configuration might not be conducive to its 'reset' behavior unless certain internal conditions are met or it's not near a specific interactable object. A movement sequence will change the position of the movable blocks and hopefully, the overall game state."
