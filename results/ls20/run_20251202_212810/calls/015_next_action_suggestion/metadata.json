    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no effect three times in a row in the current state. The rule dictates that we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying a 'no effect' action. However, since no movement actions (ACTION1-4) are yet verified, we cannot reliably construct a setup sequence. Therefore, the highest priority is to get more observations for the remaining unverified actions. ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 all have 0/3 consistent observations and 1/8 attempts, making them equally good candidates. I'm choosing ACTION1 simply to make progress on validating movement actions.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Observing the effect of ACTION1 will either provide the second consistent observation towards verifying it, or a new effect that requires further testing. This is crucial for building a library of verified movement actions to escape 'no effect' states.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current game state requires validation of basic movement actions to allow for strategic exploration. ACTION5 is stuck in a 'no effect' loop for the current position without verified movement actions."
