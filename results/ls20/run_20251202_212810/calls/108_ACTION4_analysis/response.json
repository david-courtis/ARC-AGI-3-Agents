The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 48) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 48) were present, but remained stationary. There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified, nor any visible obstruction to the right. This situation is consistent with previous 'no effect' observations for ACTION4 under similar conditions. It appears that specific selection or activation criteria must be met for these blocks to respond to movement actions.",
