  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION2.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION2:\n\"ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (40, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (42, 40).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION2 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) moved down to (41,40), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40) moved down to (43,40).\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (8, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located below it at (10, 24). They were within the main play area.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION2 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24) moved down to (9,24), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24) moved down to (11,24).\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (32, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (34, 32).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION2 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32) moved down to (33,32), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32) moved down to (35,32). Another block, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) which was not explicitly part of the initial movable object context, appeared at (32, 32).\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when other blocks move is inconsistent for ACTION4. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4 are still unknown, suggesting a more complex trigger than simple movement of other blocks.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause objects to move. There might be a selection mechanism or a requirement for 'selected' objects to be present to move.\n  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when ACTION1 is taken is not guaranteed. There are as yet unknown conditions that cause its disappearance.\n  - The appearance/disappearance logic for the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) is complex and tied to both ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION4, but with inconsistent triggers. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4, and its disappearance with ACTION1, are still unknown.\n  - The presence of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) does not cause it to disappear when ACTION3 is executed on other blocks.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed.
