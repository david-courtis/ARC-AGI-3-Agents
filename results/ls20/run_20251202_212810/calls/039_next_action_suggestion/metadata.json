However, in certain contexts, it can also cause other adjacent objects to disappear or be 'destroyed'.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided, acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action, clearing the previous game state and generating a new one with various new objects and a changed UI.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 can cause a complete game reset, including new object generation and UI changes, if no specific interaction context is present.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had many 'no effect' outcomes or a full reset. While the last ACTION5 did reset the game, we still need to validate its behavior and explore other actions. ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 all have very few consistent observations (0-1). ACTION1 has the lowest consistency (0/3) and the most attempts with varied results, indicating it's highly context-dependent. Starting with ACTION1 will help us gather more data on its specific actions for different states.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the movement or interaction of objects with ACTION1. Specifically, we're looking for consistent behavior to verify its definition. We might also uncover more 'destruction' effects if we are at an appropriate position.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The board has several scattered objects. The recent reset by ACTION5 means the game state is now fresh, which is a good opportunity to test other actions to see how they interact with this new default state."
