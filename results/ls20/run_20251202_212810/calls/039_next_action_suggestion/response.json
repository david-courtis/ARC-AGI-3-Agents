  "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had many 'no effect' outcomes or a full reset. While the last ACTION5 did reset the game, we still need to validate its behavior and explore other actions. ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 all have very few consistent observations (0-1). ACTION1 has the lowest consistency (0/3) and the most attempts with varied results, indicating it's highly context-dependent. Starting with ACTION1 will help us gather more data on its specific actions for different states.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the movement or interaction of objects with ACTION1. Specifically, we're looking for consistent behavior to verify its definition. We might also uncover more 'destruction' effects if we are at an appropriate position.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board has several scattered objects. The recent reset by ACTION5 means the game state is now fresh, which is a good opportunity to test other actions to see how they interact with this new default state."
