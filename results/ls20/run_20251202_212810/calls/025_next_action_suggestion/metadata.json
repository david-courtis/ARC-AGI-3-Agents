However, in certain contexts, it can also cause other adjacent objects to disappear or be 'destroyed'.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "target_action": "ACTION4",
    "setup_sequence": [],
    "reasoning": "ACTION4 has only been attempted once and is not yet consistent. While ACTION5 also needs more testing, it has shown no effect recently in the current state. Since we have no verified movement actions, we cannot form a setup sequence to move to a different position to test ACTION5. Therefore, it is more efficient to test an action that has not had multiple no-effect attempts from the current position. Testing another movement action like ACTION4 will help us gather more data on its behavior and potentially lead to its verification, which would then allow for more strategic movement for testing other actions.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the effect of ACTION4 on the current board state. This will contribute to understanding its movement pattern and context-dependent behaviors, moving it closer to verification. Specifically, we'll look for which objects move and in what direction (right).",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board has several distinct rectangular blocks of different colors. There is a prominent 'L' shaped block in the bottom left, and another complex structure in the upper right. There are a couple of small single-pixel blocks in the middle. We are currently at a state where many actions either cause movement of specific blocks or have no effect. ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in recent attempts, suggesting it might be context-dependent or inactive in the current state."
