  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had multiple recent 'no effect' attempts in the current state. According to the rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retesting an action that previously had no effect. Since no actions are yet fully verified, we will use actions with at least one observed effect for the setup sequence. The goal of the setup sequence is to change the 'context' for ACTION5, as its previous effects indicate it's highly context-dependent (either no effect or a full game reset). Moving closer to the orange and green squares for example, or the magenta/black L-shape, might change the context enough for ACTION5 to have a different effect. We will prioritize moving to a new section of the board.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe a different effect from ACTION5 now that the game state, specifically the 'player' or 'selection' position, has been altered. This could lead to a less drastic 'interact' effect, or at least help us understand what conditions trigger the full game reset versus no effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows several distinct objects, including some squares at the top right (orange and green), a complex shape in the middle, and an L-shape at the bottom-left. The previous ACTION5 attempts consistently had 'no effect' in the previous states. Testing ACTION5 again in the same state would be redundant. We need to explore how changing the perceived 'focus' or 'position' affects its outcome."
