Despite being present and normally movable to the right, they did not move. There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified, nor any visible obstruction to the right. This situation is consistent with previous 'no effect' observations for ACTION4 under similar conditions. It appears that specific selection or activation criteria must be met for these blocks to respond to movement actions.",

No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously. The background was green.",

  "no_effect_reason": "No objects moved. The blocks that would typically move right did not. This reinforces that not all objects always respond to movement actions and there are likely unobserved selection/activation mechanisms for movement.",
