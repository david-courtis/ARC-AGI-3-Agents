  "reasoning": "ACTION4 recently had a 'NO EFFECT' attempt. Following the critical rule, we must use a setup sequence of verified actions to change the game state before re-testing it. ACTION2 is the only VERIFIED action available. Using ACTION2 twice should move any movable objects, especially the 8x2 block, to a sufficiently different position to re-test ACTION4. This addresses the 'ACTION4 NO EFFECT' attempt and continues to gather observations for ACTION4.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a new observation for ACTION4, specifically verifying whether it moves objects to the right, or triggers another game reset under these new conditions. This will help us clarify the conditions under which ACTION4 causes a reset versus a simple movement.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains several rectangular blocks, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) which has been involved in previous actions. The overall layout suggests a possibility of movement or interaction based on object positions. Since ACTION4 had a 'NO EFFECT' recently, the current state is not ideal for re-testing it without a setup sequence."
