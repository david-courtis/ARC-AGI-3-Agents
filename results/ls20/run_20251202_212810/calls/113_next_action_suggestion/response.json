  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has had multiple 'no effect' outcomes recently (5 consecutive). The rule states to use a setup sequence of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position before retesting. ACTION2 is the only fully VERIFIED action. By executing ACTION2 twice, we will move any 'selected' or movable objects in the scene downwards, thus changing the game state significantly enough to re-test the no-effect action. This will prevent a redundant attempt of ACTION4 in the same state. This sequence will ensure a new testing context for ACTION4. We also need to get more consistent observations for ACTION4 to verify its definition and understand the reset conditions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION4 after moving to a new state with ACTION2, we aim to observe if ACTION4 now causes an effect (either movement or a reset) and if the conditions for the appearance of the Color 9 block at (32,32) are met. This will help us gain an additional consistent observation for ACTION4, eventually leading to its verification and a better understanding of its reset mechanics and side-effects. We will also learn if the game state change induced by two ACTION2s is sufficient to make ACTION4 affective again.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various objects, but recent attempts of ACTION4 have shown no effect. This suggests that either no relevant objects are 'selected' or in a state to be affected by ACTION4, or the context is not right for its effect or a reset. Moving objects with ACTION2 will change their position relative to the background and other objects, potentially creating a new context where ACTION4 might have an effect or reveal its reset condition."
