  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:\n\"ACTION1 appears to move a selected object one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). However, in certain contexts, it can also cause other adjacent objects to disappear or be 'destroyed'.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (4 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (40, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (42, 24).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24) moved up to (39,24). The Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24) disappeared. This suggests that ACTION1 may cause certain blocks to move up and other blocks to disappear, or that the Color 9 block was an 'obstacle' for the Color 12 block, or that the Color 9 block was 'destroyed' in the process of moving the Color 12 block. This outcome is inconsistent with the previous observation where both blocks moved up.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (16, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (18, 24).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24) moved upwards to (15,24). A Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24) also moved upwards to (17,24).\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 40).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved up to (47,40), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved up to (49,40).\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 can cause a complete game reset, including new object generation and UI changes, if no specific interaction context is present.\n  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no selected object'.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 147 pixels changed.
