  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 appears to move a selected object one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). However, in certain contexts, it can also cause other adjacent objects to disappear or be 'destroyed'.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is selected or at a current interaction position, has no visible effect. It is hypothesized that ACTION5 requires a 'selected' object or a 'current position' to perform an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION3 has only been attempted once and its effect is unknown. It's a high priority to gather more data on unexplored actions. The current state doesn't seem to actively prevent ACTION3 from having an effect, as there is an object in the lower-left that could potentially be moved, and several objects on the right that have been moved by other actions. Also, there are no recent 'no effect' attempts for ACTION3.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the effect of ACTION3 on an object in the environment, helping to understand its primary function. We also want to see if it causes any secondary effects like ACTION1.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The board has several block-like objects. The top row has a series of small, colored blocks. There's a larger structure near the top right, and another smaller block-like object in the lower left. The central area is mostly clear. This state appears suitable for testing lateral movement actions."
