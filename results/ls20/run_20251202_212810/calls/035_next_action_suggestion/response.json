  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no effect in 3 recent attempts, suggesting the current state is not conducive to its function. Given its hypothesized 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' nature, it likely requires an object to be 'selected' or a specific context. Since no movement actions are verified, we will use an unverified movement action for setup. ACTION4 has one consistent observation of moving a block to the right. Moving to the right provides a different spatial context where ACTION5 might interact with a different object or become active. The goal is to vary the position to attempt to activate ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving to a new position with ACTION4 and then attempting ACTION5, we hope to observe an effect for ACTION5, potentially revealing its selection or interaction mechanism. We also hope to gain another consistent observation for ACTION4, bringing it closer to verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, as evidenced by multiple failed attempts with ACTION5, appears to lack the necessary conditions for ACTION5 to produce a visible effect. There are several blocks on the screen, some of which were affected by prior actions. A change in position is required to give ACTION5 a new context."
