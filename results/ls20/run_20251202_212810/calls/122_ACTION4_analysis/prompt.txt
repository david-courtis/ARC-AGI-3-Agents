Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). No effect is observed if blocks are not selected or conditions for movement are not met. Under certain, currently unknown, conditions, ACTION4 can trigger a full game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, and the two affected blocks to reappear with a movement transformation (right movement combined with an 'appearance' effect for the new board). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (21 total):
  [1] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (50, 48). Other various blocks and shapes were present. No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously. The background was green.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.
  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (50, 48). Other various blocks and shapes were present. No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously. The background was green.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.
  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (50, 48). Other various blocks and shapes were present.

Recent Observations:
  - The conditions for ACTION3 to trigger a game reset are still unknown, but it does not always trigger a reset when multiple objects are present and it can perform its 'move left' function.
  - The conditions for ACTION4 to trigger a full game reset are still unknown, as it did not occur in this instance.
  - The conditions for the appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) during ACTION4 are still unknown, as it did not appear in this instance.
  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) with ACTION1 is highly contextual and does not occur in all instances where other blocks move up. It appears to be linked to the background, whether it's the green or orange background, or a more precise placement and type of objects around it. Further observation will be needed.
  - It appears that specific selection or activation criteria must be met for blocks to respond to movement actions.
