  "reasoning": "ACTION4 consistently showed no effect recently in the current state (7 times, 3 of them consecutively). According to the rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different state before retesting it. Since ACTION2 is the only verified movement action, we will use it twice to ensure a significant change in position. This should allow us to test ACTION4 again in a new context, hoping to trigger either its movement effect or the game reset and gain more information about its conditions. We are prioritizing actions that need more validation (ACTION4 has 0/3 consistency) and have had no effect recently.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION4 after a clear movement with ACTION2, we aim to observe if it can now produce its intended rightward movement or if it triggers a game reset. We want to understand the conditions under which ACTION4 causes either an effect or a reset, and specifically the conditions for the appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 block at (32,32). Moving the movable objects via ACTION2 might put them in a state where ACTION4 is effective.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains several objects, some of which are documented as being movable. However, ACTION4 has had no effect in this current configuration. There are a number of objects, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40), and other objects that have been involved in prior ACTION4 actions (e.g., Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24)). We need to alter the positions of these objects to re-evaluate ACTION4's behavior."
