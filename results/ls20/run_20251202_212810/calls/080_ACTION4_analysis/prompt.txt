Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (6 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (24, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (26, 40).
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 40) moved right to (24,41), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 40) moved right to (26,41). No other object appeared or disappeared in this instance.
  [2] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (24, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (26, 48). Other various blocks and shapes were present. No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (32, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (34, 40).
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 40) moved right to (32,41) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 40) moved right to (34,41). No other object appeared or disappeared in this instance.

Recent Observations:
  - The movement of specified blocks is consistent with the 'Move RIGHT' interpretation of ACTION4.
  - ACTION3 can, under certain conditions, trigger a full game reset, similar to how ACTION5 sometimes does.
  - During a game reset caused by ACTION3, not only do existing objects disappear and new ones appear, but the objects that were 'involved' might also undergo a movement transformation as part of their reappearance on the new board.
  - ACTION1 can also act as a full game reset under certain conditions.
  - The conditions for ACTION1 triggering a game reset are currently unknown.
