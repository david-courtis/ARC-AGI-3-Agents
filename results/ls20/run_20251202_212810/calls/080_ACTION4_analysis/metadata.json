  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:\n\"ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (6 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (24, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (26, 40).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 40) moved right to (24,41), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 40) moved right to (26,41). No other object appeared or disappeared in this instance.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (24, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (26, 48). Other various blocks and shapes were present. No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (32, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (34, 40).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 40) moved right to (32,41) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 40) moved right to (34,41). No other object appeared or disappeared in this instance.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 5 8x8 shape: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 3x3 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The movement of specified blocks is consistent with the 'Move RIGHT' interpretation of ACTION4.\n  - ACTION3 can, under certain conditions, trigger a full game reset, similar to how ACTION5 sometimes does.\n  - During a game reset caused by ACTION3, not only do existing objects disappear and new ones appear, but the objects that were 'involved' might also undergo a movement transformation as part of their reappearance on the new board.\n  - ACTION1 can also act as a full game reset under certain conditions.\n  - The conditions for ACTION1 triggering a game reset are currently unknown.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed.
