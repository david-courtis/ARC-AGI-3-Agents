No other object appeared or disappeared in this instance. The background changed from green to orange along with other UI elements, similar to a game 'reset'.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). Under certain, currently unknown, conditions, ACTION4 can trigger a full game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, and the two affected blocks to reappear with a movement transformation (right movement combined with an 'appearance' effect for the new board). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "Two movable blocks, Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40), were present. However, instead of simply moving right, the entire game state reset, and the two blocks appeared in new positions as part of that reset. This suggests that certain environmental conditions or absence of specific objects trigger a 'reset' when ACTION4 is performed.",
