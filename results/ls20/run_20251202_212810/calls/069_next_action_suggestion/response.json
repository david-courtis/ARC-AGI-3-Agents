  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has only been attempted twice and has one consistent observation. It needs more validation to verify its definition. ACTION4 and ACTION5 both had recent 'no effect' outcomes in the previous state, so we must avoid testing them in the current state without a setup sequence. While ACTION2 has two consistent observations, ACTION3 is less explored.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validate the definition of ACTION3, observe if it consistently moves selected blocks to the left, and if the side effects (like the Color 9 block at (32,32)) are consistent or new patterns emerge.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various objects, including some that have been seen to move with other actions. This should be a suitable state to test if ACTION3 applies to any of these immediately visible objects. There are no obvious environmental constraints (e.g. against a wall) that would prevent movement to the left for a hypothetical selected object."
