  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 8/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). The presence and movement of other objects specifically impacts whether a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) appears, disappears, or remains.\n  ACTION2: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided (and likely also when no game reset condition is met), has no effect. The specific conditions under which it acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action are still undefined but are more complex than simply the absence of a selected object.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION4 can cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move right, similar to ACTION2. This suggests the appearance of this specific block is tied to the movement of other blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6), not necessarily the direction of movement, and is a side effect.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when other blocks move is inconsistent for ACTION4. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4 are still unknown, suggesting a more complex trigger than simple movement of other blocks.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause objects to move. There might be a selection mechanism or a requirement for 'selected' objects to be present to move.\n  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when ACTION1 is taken is not guaranteed. There are as yet unknown conditions that cause its disappearance.\n  - The appearance/disappearance logic for the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) is complex and tied to both ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION4, but with inconsistent triggers. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4, and its disappearance with ACTION1, are still unknown.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION3 has only been attempted twice and has one consistent observation. It needs more validation to verify its definition. ACTION4 and ACTION5 both had recent 'no effect' outcomes in the previous state, so we must avoid testing them in the current state without a setup sequence. While ACTION2 has two consistent observations, ACTION3 is less explored.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Further validate the definition of ACTION3, observe if it consistently moves selected blocks to the left, and if the side effects (like the Color 9 block at (32,32)) are consistent or new patterns emerge.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various objects, including some that have been seen to move with other actions. This should be a suitable state to test if ACTION3 applies to any of these immediately visible objects. There are no obvious environmental constraints (e.g. against a wall) that would prevent movement to the left for a hypothetical selected object."
