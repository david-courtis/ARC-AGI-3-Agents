  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before re-testing it. ACTION2 is the only verified movement action. We will move multiple times with ACTION2 to ensure a significant change in position from where ACTION5 previously failed. While ACTION4 also had recent no-effects, ACTION5 has the fewest attempts overall and the most ambiguous definition, making its verification a higher priority. The current game state contains several distinct objects that might be selectable or interactable with ACTION5, including the prominent yellow/black object near the center, and the purple/cyan object in the bottom right, and the black/purple object in the bottom left.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a significant positional change, we aim to discover if it has an effect in a new context. This might help us identify the conditions under which ACTION5 acts as an 'interact', 'select', 'rotate', or even another type of reset. Specifically, we want to see if the presence or position of certain objects, now perceived differently, will trigger an effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows several distinct objects on a green background. There is a yellow/black shape with a small purple pixel near the center, a black L-shape with a purple pixel bottom left, and a larger purple block with a cyan line on top at the bottom right. The top border also has a pattern of red and green squares. The variety of objects and their positions suggest potential interaction points for ACTION5. However, the last ACTION5 attempt had no effect, so the current state might not be ideal without movement."
