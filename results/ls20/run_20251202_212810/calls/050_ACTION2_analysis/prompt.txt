Analyze the effect of action ACTION2.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION2:
"ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell)."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (40, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (42, 40).
      Interpretation: When ACTION2 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) moved down to (41,40), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40) moved down to (43,40).
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (8, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located below it at (10, 24). They were within the main play area.
      Interpretation: When ACTION2 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24) moved down to (9,24), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24) moved down to (11,24).

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION5 can cause a complete game reset, including new object generation and UI changes, if no specific interaction context is present.
  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no selected object'.
  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) suggests that objects of type Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at location (32,32) might be 'triggers' or automatically removed under certain conditions, specifically when ACTION1 is performed and other objects are moved upwards. This is a newly observed interaction and overrides the previous idea of selection for ACTION1.
