  "reasoning": "We haven't observed any actions yet, so we need to start by testing each action to understand its effect. Starting with ACTION1 allows us to test a basic directional movement and begin building our understanding of the game's mechanics. The current position appears central enough that testing a movement action won't immediately lead to being stuck against a wall.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe what happens when ACTION1 is performed. Ideally, the agent will move 'up' (decrease row/y). This will be the first step in understanding movement controls.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The agent is in a fairly open area with no immediate obstacles. There are other objects on the screen (the yellow/black figure, the purple/cyan block) but they are not directly adjacent to the agent. The red and orange squares at the top might be UI elements or boundaries."
