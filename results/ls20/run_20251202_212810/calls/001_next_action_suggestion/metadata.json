    "reasoning": "We haven't observed any actions yet, so we need to start by testing each action to understand its effect. Starting with ACTION1 allows us to test a basic directional movement and begin building our understanding of the game's mechanics. The current position appears central enough that testing a movement action won't immediately lead to being stuck against a wall.",

    "current_board_assessment": "The agent is in a fairly open area with no immediate obstacles. There are other objects on the screen (the yellow/black figure, the purple/cyan block) but they are not directly adjacent to the agent. The red and orange squares at the top might be UI elements or boundaries."
