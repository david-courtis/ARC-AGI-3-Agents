  "reasoning": "ACTION4 had two recent consecutive 'no effect' attempts. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before re-testing it. ACTION2 is the only currently VERIFIED movement action, making it a reliable choice for the setup sequence. Moving twice using ACTION2 should sufficiently alter the game state to give ACTION4 a new context for testing. We are prioritizing actions that need more validation and have recently failed (ACTION4 and ACTION5), and ACTION1 is considered 'not yet verified' but has shown effects recently, so its immediate re-testing might not yield new information about its 'reset' behavior without more detailed analysis. Given the priority, ACTION4 is the next logical step after a setup move to avoid repeated no-effect attempts.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION4 after a setup sequence, we aim to confirm if its previous 'no effect' was due to the specific game state. We also hope to gather more data points to understand the conditions under which ACTION4 causes a full game reset or moves objects to the right, and to work towards verifying its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state led to two 'no effect' outcomes for ACTION4. There are multiple objects present, but it seems their positions, or a lack of selected objects, prevented ACTION4 from having its intended effect. Changing the board state with verified moves is critical before re-testing ACTION4."
