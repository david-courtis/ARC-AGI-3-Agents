  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 7/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). If a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) is present at (32,32) when ACTION1 is performed AND other objects are moved 'up', this specific 2x2 block will disappear.\n  ACTION2: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided (and likely also when no game reset condition is met), has no effect. The specific conditions under which it acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action are still undefined but are more complex than simply the absence of a selected object.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION1's effect on objects depends on their location and other objects present. Specifically, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) can disappear when ACTION1 is performed and causes other objects to move up.\n  - The interaction where a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) disappears when ACTION1 causes adjacent blocks to move up is consistently reproducible.\n  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no specific object selected' and the current context for that is still unknown.\n  - ACTION4 can cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move right, similar to ACTION2. This suggests the appearance of this specific block is tied to the movement of other blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6), not necessarily the direction of movement, and is a side effect.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when other blocks move is inconsistent for ACTION4. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4 are still unknown, suggesting a more complex trigger than simple movement of other blocks.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 has zero consistent observations and only 4 attempts, making it a high priority for further testing. It has also shown 'EFFECT' in the last two attempts. Since ACTION4 has shown an effect in previous attempts from what is likely a similar state, we can attempt it again to gain more observations towards verification. ACTION5 has consistently shown 'NO EFFECT' recently, and would require a setup sequence. ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 have more observations and some consistency already, placing ACTION4 as a higher priority for raw observation gathering.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Further observations on ACTION4's movement behavior and conditions for the appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32). We aim to get closer to 3 consistent observations for verification.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The board appears to be in a state where objects are present that have previously responded to ACTION4. Specifically, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24) were affected by ACTION4 in past observations, and a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34,32) were also affected. These objects appear to be present and positioned adequately for further testing of ACTION4."
