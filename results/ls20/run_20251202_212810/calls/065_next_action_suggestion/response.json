  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has zero consistent observations and only 4 attempts, making it a high priority for further testing. It has also shown 'EFFECT' in the last two attempts. Since ACTION4 has shown an effect in previous attempts from what is likely a similar state, we can attempt it again to gain more observations towards verification. ACTION5 has consistently shown 'NO EFFECT' recently, and would require a setup sequence. ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 have more observations and some consistency already, placing ACTION4 as a higher priority for raw observation gathering.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further observations on ACTION4's movement behavior and conditions for the appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32). We aim to get closer to 3 consistent observations for verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board appears to be in a state where objects are present that have previously responded to ACTION4. Specifically, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24) were affected by ACTION4 in past observations, and a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34,32) were also affected. These objects appear to be present and positioned adequately for further testing of ACTION4."
