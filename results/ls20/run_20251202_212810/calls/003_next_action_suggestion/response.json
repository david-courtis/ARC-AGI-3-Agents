  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5 have not been observed yet. To efficiently gather new information, we prioritize testing completely unobserved actions. Among these, ACTION2 (Move DOWN) is chosen next as it is a fundamental movement action and directly complements the partially observed ACTION1 (Move UP). The current state seems generic enough to test a basic movement action like ACTION2.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe the effect of ACTION2, specifically if it moves objects, the player, or changes the environment in any way, contributing to our understanding of basic downward movement.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board features several rectangular blocks. One (8x2 color 12) at (48,40) and another (8x6 color 9) at (50,40) have been affected by ACTION1 previously. The screen appears to be a grid-based environment. There are no obvious obstacles or features that would inherently block a 'move down' action at this stage, making the current state suitable for testing basic movement."
