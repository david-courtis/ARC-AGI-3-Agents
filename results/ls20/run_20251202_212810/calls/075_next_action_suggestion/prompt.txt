Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 8/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). The presence and movement of other objects specifically impacts whether a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) appears, disappears, or remains.
  ACTION2: VERIFIED - ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).
  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided (and likely also when no game reset condition is met), has no effect. The specific conditions under which it acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action are still undefined but are more complex than simply the absence of a selected object.

Recent Observations:
  - The presence of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) does not cause it to disappear when ACTION3 is executed on other blocks.
  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) with ACTION2 is context-dependent and did not occur in this observation.
  - The general movement down of the two larger blocks is consistent with the 'Move DOWN' interpretation of ACTION2.
  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when ACTION4 is executed is context-dependent and does not always occur.
  - The movement of specified blocks is consistent with the 'Move RIGHT' interpretation of ACTION4.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION2
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5
