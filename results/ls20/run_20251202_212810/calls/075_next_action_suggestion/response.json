  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 is currently at 2/3 consistent observations. There are no recent 'no effect' attempts for ACTION3, meaning we can test it directly in the current state to try and gain the third consistent observation and verify it. Verifying movement actions is a high priority for building reliable setup sequences.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe ACTION3 moving blocks one unit to the left again. If it is consistent, ACTION3 will become verified, which is crucial for future setup sequences. We will also monitor for any unexpected side effects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state appears suitable for testing ACTION3 as there are movable blocks present (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32)). There are no immediate obstacles to prevent leftward movement for these objects. We are in a state where we can continue gathering data for pending actions without needing to move first."
