  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 8/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). The presence and movement of other objects specifically impacts whether a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) appears, disappears, or remains.\n  ACTION2: VERIFIED - ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided (and likely also when no game reset condition is met), has no effect. The specific conditions under which it acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action are still undefined but are more complex than simply the absence of a selected object.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The presence of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) does not cause it to disappear when ACTION3 is executed on other blocks.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) with ACTION2 is context-dependent and did not occur in this observation.\n  - The general movement down of the two larger blocks is consistent with the 'Move DOWN' interpretation of ACTION2.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when ACTION4 is executed is context-dependent and does not always occur.\n  - The movement of specified blocks is consistent with the 'Move RIGHT' interpretation of ACTION4.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION2\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "setup_sequence": [],
    "reasoning": "ACTION3 is currently at 2/3 consistent observations. There are no recent 'no effect' attempts for ACTION3, meaning we can test it directly in the current state to try and gain the third consistent observation and verify it. Verifying movement actions is a high priority for building reliable setup sequences.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe ACTION3 moving blocks one unit to the left again. If it is consistent, ACTION3 will become verified, which is crucial for future setup sequences. We will also monitor for any unexpected side effects.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state appears suitable for testing ACTION3 as there are movable blocks present (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32)). There are no immediate obstacles to prevent leftward movement for these objects. We are in a state where we can continue gathering data for pending actions without needing to move first."
