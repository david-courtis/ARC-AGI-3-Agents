  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has had recent 'no effect' attempts, so it's critical to test it from a new state. The current board is rather static, and there isn't a direct target for many of the actions that could potentially trigger a reset, making it hard to get consistent observations. By performing a setup sequence with a verified action (ACTION2), we can alter the game state and potentially find new conditions for ACTION4's behavior. ACTION2 is chosen as a verified action to ensure the setup sequence reliably changes the environment. Moving 'down' twice is a simple way to create a distinct state. This should give a 'fresh' state where ACTION4 can be re-evaluated. Also, ACTION4 is still far from verified and needs more observation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe if ACTION4 can trigger a reset or have its intended 'move right' effect in a new position, potentially revealing specific environmental conditions required for its different behaviors. We want to see if the recent 'no effect' attempts were due to the state or if the action itself has context-dependent mechanics we are missing. Specifically, we want to try and trigger the move right, the full game reset or the appearance of a new block. This attempt would contribute to moving ACTION4 closer to consistency or reveal new aspects of its reset conditions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely unchanged from previous observations, with no clear 'selected' objects or immediate interaction points that would explain ACTION5's behavior or prevent ACTION's movement. It's a neutral state, making it a good candidate for attempting setup sequences with verified moves before re-testing pending actions. The recent 'no effect' results for ACTION4 and ACTION5 suggest the current state might not be optimal for observing their effects or that their triggers are more subtle."
