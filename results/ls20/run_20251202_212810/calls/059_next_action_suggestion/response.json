  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has recently had no effect four times in a row. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move first before retrying ACTION5. However, we do not have any VERIFIED actions to use in a setup sequence yet. Therefore, the highest priority is to get another action verified or find new information about one of the pending actions. ACTION4 has only been tested twice and has a partial definition. Testing it again will either provide the 3rd consistent observation to verify it, or give new information. The current state is not obviously detrimental to testing ACTION4 as there appears to be space to the right.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get closer to verifying ACTION4. We might discover more about what objects ACTION4 affects and if there are any specific conditions for its effect. This might also allow us to use ACTION4 as part of a setup sequence in the future.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains various blocks, some of which have been identified as movable by prior actions. The main interactive elements seem to be the movable blocks. We are currently in a state where ACTION5 resulted in no effect several times, indicating the need to change the state before re-testing it. We have not yet verified any movement actions."
