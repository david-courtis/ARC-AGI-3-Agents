  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has had two recent 'NO EFFECT' outcomes and needs to be retested from a different position. Since ACTION2 is verified and moves objects downwards, using it twice will significantly change the position of movable objects on the screen, creating a new context for ACTION4. This addresses the critical rule of not repeating a 'NO EFFECT' action in the same state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION4 after a positional change, we aim to: 1. See if it now causes an effect (either moving blocks or triggering a reset). 2. If it moves an object, we will get closer to verifying its 'move right' definition. 3. If it triggers a reset, we can further investigate the conditions for such resets tied to ACTION4 and its side effects, such as the appearance of the Color 9 block at (32,32).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, with several movable blocks, is suitable for testing movement actions. However, to avoid another 'NO EFFECT' for ACTION4, changing the position of these blocks is necessary. Applying ACTION2 twice ensures a noticeable vertical shift, providing a distinct testing environment for ACTION4."
