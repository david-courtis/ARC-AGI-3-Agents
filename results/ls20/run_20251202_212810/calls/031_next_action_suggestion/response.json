  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has the fewest attempts (1/8 attempts) and therefore needs the most validation. While ACTION5 also has low consistency (0/3), it has been attempted 8 times and the recent history shows multiple 'NO EFFECT' results, suggesting it's not the right time or state to test it again directly. The current game state has several movable blocks, which is suitable for testing movement actions. Since ACTION2 has only been tested once, we should prioritize attempts to verify its behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get more consistent observations about what ACTION2 does, specifically if it reliably moves selected objects downwards and under what conditions. This will help us achieve 3 consistent observations to verify its definition.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board has multiple distinct movable blocks (Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks) that appear to be interactable, making it a good state to test movement actions. There doesn't appear to be any immediate obstruction that would prevent a downward movement, so no setup sequence is immediately necessary for ACTION2."
