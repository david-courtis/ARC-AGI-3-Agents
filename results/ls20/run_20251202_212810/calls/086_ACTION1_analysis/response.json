The Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) (which sometimes disappears with ACTION1) did not disappear, suggesting that its disappearance is contingent on a specific context not met here. This context included the presence of other blocks and a green background, indicating it was not a 'reset' scenario.",
