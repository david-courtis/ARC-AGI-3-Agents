Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 generally moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). However, under specific and currently unknown conditions, ACTION1 can trigger a full game reset, similar to some instances of ACTION3 and ACTION5. When a reset occurs, existing objects disappear, and a new set of objects appear, often with a changed background and UI. The objects that were present before the reset may reappear in a different location as part of the new game state."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (9 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (42, 32). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved up to (39,32), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) moved up to (41,32). Concurrently, the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) disappeared.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (24, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (26, 48). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48) moved up to (23,48), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48) moved up to (25,48). The Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) remained unchanged, it did not disappear.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 40). The background was a solid orange, with no other discernible objects.
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, the entire game state reset. All previous objects disappeared and many new objects appeared, including a large background object and several smaller blocks/shapes. The UI elements also changed significantly. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) were replaced by a new Color 12 rectangular block and a new Color 9 rectangular block in different positions.

Recent Observations:
  - During a game reset caused by ACTION3, not only do existing objects disappear and new ones appear, but the objects that were 'involved' might also undergo a movement transformation as part of their reappearance on the new board.
  - ACTION1 can also act as a full game reset under certain conditions.
  - The conditions for ACTION1 triggering a game reset are currently unknown.
  - ACTION4 can sometimes trigger a full game reset, similar to ACTION1 and ACTION3, and specific instances of ACTION5. The conditions for this full game reset are still unknown.
  - When a full game reset occurs, objects that were present before the reset may reappear in transformed positions as part of the new game state (i.e., a 'moved' state after reset).
