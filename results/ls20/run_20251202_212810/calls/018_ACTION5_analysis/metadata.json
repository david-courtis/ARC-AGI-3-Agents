  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION5.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION5:\n\"None\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT\n      Context: Multiple objects were present including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40), as well as other blocks and shapes of various colors. No specific object was indicated as 'selected' or 'at current position' for interaction.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This means the action had no effect in this specific context.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32). There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified for interaction.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24). There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified for interaction.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
