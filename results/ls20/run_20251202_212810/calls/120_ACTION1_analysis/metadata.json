  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:\n\"ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). Under specific and currently unknown conditions, ACTION1 can trigger a full game reset. When a reset occurs, existing objects disappear, and a new set of objects appear, often with a changed background and UI. The objects present before the reset may reappear in a different location as part of the new game state. The disappearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) is a contextual side-effect that does not always occur when other blocks move up.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (11 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 40). The background was a solid orange, with no other discernible objects.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, the entire game state reset. All previous objects disappeared and many new objects appeared, including a large background object and several smaller blocks/shapes. The UI elements also changed significantly. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) were replaced by a new Color 12 rectangular block and a new Color 9 rectangular block in different positions.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (50, 48). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32). The background was green.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 48) moved up to (47,48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 48) moved up to (49,48). The Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) remained unchanged.\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (50, 48). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32). The background was green.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 48) moved up to (47,48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 48) moved up to (49,48). The Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) remained unchanged.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 5 8x8 shape: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 3x3 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 52): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (18, 34): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (3x3) at (54, 1): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 12: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 17: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 22: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 27: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 32: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 37: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 42: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The conditions for ACTION3 to trigger a game reset are still unknown, but it does not always trigger a reset when multiple objects are present and it can perform its 'move left' function.\n  - The conditions for ACTION4 to trigger a full game reset are still unknown, as it did not occur in this instance.\n  - The conditions for the appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) during ACTION4 are still unknown, as it did not appear in this instance.\n  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) with ACTION1 is highly contextual and does not occur in all instances where other blocks move up. It appears to be linked to the background, whether it's the green or orange background, or a more precise placement and type of objects around it. Further observation will be needed.\n  - It appears that specific selection or activation criteria must be met for blocks to respond to movement actions.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed.
