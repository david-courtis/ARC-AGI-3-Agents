  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). Under specific and currently unknown conditions, ACTION1 can trigger a full game reset. When a reset occurs, existing objects disappear, and a new set of objects appear, often with a changed background and UI. The objects present before the reset may reappear in a different location as part of the new game state. The disappearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) and other contextual side-effects are highly dependent on the current game state and do not occur consistently when other blocks move up.",

The conditions for a game reset (orange background) were not met, and the specific conditions for the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) to disappear were also not met in this green background context.",
