  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 is one of the pending actions and has fewer attempts (4/8) compared to ACTION4 (6/8) and ACTION1 (10/8, though this needs to be re-evaluated for its reset vs. move effect). It also has a 'no effect' history associated with it that we want to avoid further accumulation of. Since there are currently no verified actions that allow precise movement to a specific object without risking a full reset, the current state is as good as any to test ACTION3. We want to understand what conditions cause it to move blocks versus trigger a reset. Since ACTION3 has not been attempted recently, we will try it without a setup sequence for now.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We want to observe if ACTION3 moves any blocks left, which specific blocks are affected, or if it triggers a game reset. This will help us refine its definition and work towards verification. We are particularly interested in its effect on the 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32)', the 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32)' and the 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32)' based on their prior involvement with ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains various blocks, including the important 2x2 and 8x6 blocks. The current state is suitable for observing the immediate effect of ACTION3 without a specific setup, as we haven't seen recent 'no effect' for ACTION3."
