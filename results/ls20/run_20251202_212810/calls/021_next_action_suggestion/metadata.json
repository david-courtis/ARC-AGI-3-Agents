However, in certain contexts, it can also cause other adjacent objects to disappear or be 'destroyed'.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has been attempted multiple times recently (5 times in the last 6 actions, and 3 consecutive times with no effect). According to the rules, if an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, we must use a setup sequence of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position before retesting it. Since no actions are yet verified, I will pick ACTION1, which has been attempted the most (8 times), as movement seems to be the primary function of ACTION1-4. I will attempt it 3 times to get a significant change in position. The current environment includes a 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and a 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' that were involved in ACTION1. Moving them should create a new context for ACTION5. I need to continue gathering observations for all actions.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By executing a setup sequence, we aim to change the game state. Then, testing ACTION5 again will allow us to observe if it now has an effect in this new context, helping to validate its function and conditions for activation.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The board currently has several block-like objects. The previous attempts at ACTION5 have yielded no effect, suggesting it might be context-dependent or operate on objects not currently present or selected. The current state is not conducive to retesting ACTION5 without a state change."
