  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:\n\"ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). Under certain, currently unknown, conditions, ACTION4 can trigger a full game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, and the two affected blocks to reappear with a movement transformation (right movement combined with an 'appearance' effect for the new board). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (12 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (50, 48). Other various blocks and shapes were present. No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously. The background was green.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (50, 48).

The conditions for this full game reset are still unknown.\n  - When a full game reset occurs, objects that were present before the reset may reappear in transformed positions as part of the new game state (i.e., a 'moved' state after reset).\n  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) with ACTION1 is highly contextual and does not occur in all instances where other blocks move up.\n  - ACTION3 can move two specific blocks left without causing a game reset, reaffirming its primary move function.\n  - The conditions for ACTION3 to trigger a game reset are still unknown, but it does not always trigger a reset when multiple objects are present and it can perform its 'move left' function.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed.
