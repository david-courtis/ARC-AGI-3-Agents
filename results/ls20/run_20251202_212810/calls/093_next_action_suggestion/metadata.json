  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 10/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 generally moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). However, under specific and currently unknown conditions, ACTION1 can trigger a full game reset, similar to some instances of ACTION3 and ACTION5. When a reset occurs, existing objects disappear, and a new set of objects appear, often with a changed background and UI. The objects that were present before the reset may reappear in a different location as part of the new game state.\n  ACTION2: VERIFIED - ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 usually moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left. However, sometimes, it triggers a game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, similar to ACTION5 under certain, yet to be fully understood, conditions. When a game reset occurs, the objects that were 'selected' or 'involved' in the reset might also undergo a movement transformation as they appear in the new state.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 6/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). Under certain, currently unknown, conditions, ACTION4 can trigger a full game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, and the two affected blocks to reappear with a movement transformation (right movement combined with an 'appearance' effect for the new board). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided (and likely also when no game reset condition is met), has no effect. The specific conditions under which it acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action are still undefined but are more complex than simply the absence of a selected object.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 5 8x8 shape: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 3x3 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 52): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (18, 34): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (3x3) at (54, 1): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 12: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 17: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 22: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 27: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 32: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 37: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 42: Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION1 can also act as a full game reset under certain conditions.\n  - The conditions for ACTION1 triggering a game reset are currently unknown.\n  - ACTION4 can sometimes trigger a full game reset, similar to ACTION1 and ACTION3, and specific instances of ACTION5. The conditions for this full game reset are still unknown.\n  - When a full game reset occurs, objects that were present before the reset may reappear in transformed positions as part of the new game state (i.e., a 'moved' state after reset).\n  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) with ACTION1 is highly contextual and does not occur in all instances where other blocks move up.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION2\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 is largely untested and has had little effect so far. The previous attempts at ACTION5 had no effect, implying that it might require specific conditions or object proximity to trigger. The observation data lists several objects as being 'involved' in ACTION5 (e.g., Color 8 64x64 block, Color 4 irregular shape). By strategically using the VERIFIED ACTION2 to move, we can effectively change the game state and potentially bring the 'player' (or relevant interactable object) closer to one of these listed objects, or move to a different general area of the screen. Two uses of ACTION2 is chosen to ensure a significant change in position from where previous no-effect actions were attempted. This provides a fresh context for testing ACTION5.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Testing ACTION5 in a new position increases our chances of discovering when it produces a visible effect, distinguishing whether it's context-dependent (e.g., proximity to an object) or if its 'no-effect' behavior is simply due to unmet internal conditions. We aim to confirm if any of the listed objects like the 'Color 8 64x64 block' or 'Color 4 irregular shape' are indeed interactive, and how ACTION5 affects them, or if it triggers a game reset under new conditions. By changing the board state, we can also explore the 'reset' condition for ACTION5 which is currently undefined.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, while not explicitly 'bad' for any action, is not ideal for re-testing actions that have recently shown 'no effect' without changing the context. Several blocks are present, including a prominent yellow and black structure at the top-middle, and a purple and cyan structure at the bottom-right. The 'no effect' history of ACTION4 and ACTION5 suggests that a positional change is necessary before re-testing them."
