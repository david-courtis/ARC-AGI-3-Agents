  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: Two blocks, a Color 12 (8x2) and a Color 9 (8x6) were located next to each other at (48,40) and (50,40) respectively, within the play area.
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) moved upwards by a small amount. The Color 12 block moved from (48,40) to (47,40) and the Color 9 block moved from (50,40) to (49,40). This matches the semantic hint that ACTION1 means 'Move UP'.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action
