Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 appears to move a selected object one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). However, in certain contexts, it can also cause other adjacent objects to disappear or be 'destroyed'."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: Two blocks, a Color 12 (8x2) and a Color 9 (8x6) were located next to each other at (48,40) and (50,40) respectively, within the play area.
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) moved upwards by a small amount. The Color 12 block moved from (48,40) to (47,40) and the Color 9 block moved from (50,40) to (49,40). This matches the semantic hint that ACTION1 means 'Move UP'.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (40, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (42, 24).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24) moved up to (39,24). The Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24) disappeared. This suggests that ACTION1 may cause certain blocks to move up and other blocks to disappear, or that the Color 9 block was an 'obstacle' for the Color 12 block, or that the Color 9 block was 'destroyed' in the process of moving the Color 12 block. This outcome is inconsistent with the previous observation where both blocks moved up.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
