All previous objects disappeared and many new objects appeared, including a large background object and several smaller blocks/shapes. The UI elements also changed significantly. The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) were replaced by a new Color 12 rectangular block and a new Color 9 rectangular block in different positions.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION1 generally moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). However, under specific and currently unknown conditions, ACTION1 can trigger a full game reset, similar to some instances of ACTION3 and ACTION5. When a reset occurs, existing objects disappear, and a new set of objects appear, often with a changed background and UI. The objects that were present before the reset may reappear in a different location as part of the new game state.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "Instead of moving two blocks up like in previous observations for ACTION1, the action caused a full game reset. This indicates that ACTION1, under specific, currently unknown circumstances, can behave like a 'reset' action. The presence of only the two blocks and a large orange background, without a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32), might be part of the conditions that trigger this reset.",
