Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). The presence and movement of other objects specifically impacts whether a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) appears, disappears, or remains."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (8 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (42, 32). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved up to (39,32), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) moved up to (41,32). Concurrently, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) disappeared.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (42, 32). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved up to (39,32), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) moved up to (41,32). Concurrently, the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) disappeared.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (24, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (26, 48). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32).
      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48) moved up to (23,48), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48) moved up to (25,48). The Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) remained unchanged, it did not disappear.

Recent Observations:
  - The general movement down of the two larger blocks is consistent with the 'Move DOWN' interpretation of ACTION2.
  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when ACTION4 is executed is context-dependent and does not always occur.
  - The movement of specified blocks is consistent with the 'Move RIGHT' interpretation of ACTION4.
  - ACTION3 can, under certain conditions, trigger a full game reset, similar to how ACTION5 sometimes does.
  - During a game reset caused by ACTION3, not only do existing objects disappear and new ones appear, but the objects that were 'involved' might also undergo a movement transformation as part of their reappearance on the new board.
