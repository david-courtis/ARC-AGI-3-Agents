  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48) were present in the play area and were not obstructed above them, allowing them to move freely upwards. The previously observed disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) when other blocks moved up did not occur in this instance, suggesting other unknown conditions are involved for its disappearance. The presence of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) does not guarantee its disappearance upon ACTION1 when other blocks move. Similarly, the appearance of a 2x2 block with ACTION2 and ACTION4 is also context-dependent.",
