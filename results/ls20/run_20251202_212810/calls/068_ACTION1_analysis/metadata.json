If a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) is present at (32,32) when ACTION1 is performed AND other objects are moved 'up', this specific 2x2 block will disappear.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (7 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (42, 32). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved up to (39,32). A Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) also moved up to (41,32).

This suggests the appearance of this specific block is tied to the movement of other blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6), not necessarily the direction of movement, and is a side effect.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when other blocks move is inconsistent for ACTION4. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4 are still unknown, suggesting a more complex trigger than simple movement of other blocks.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause objects to move. There might be a selection mechanism or a requirement for 'selected' objects to be present to move.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed.
