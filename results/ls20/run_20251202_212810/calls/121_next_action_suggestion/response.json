  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has had 7 no-effect attempts and the last 6 actions were also no-effect attempts for ACTION4. The critical rule states that if an action had no effect in the current state, we must use a setup sequence of verified movement actions to reach a different position before testing it again. ACTION2 is the only verified movement action, so we will use it to move at least one object to a new position. This will allow us to test ACTION4 in a new state, hopefully revealing its effect or the conditions under which it causes movement or a reset. We want to test ACTION4 to gain more consistency (currently 0/3) and understand its 'reset' behavior and the conditions for the appearance of the Color 9 block.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION4 now causes selected blocks to move right in the new position, or if it triggers a game reset. Specifically, we'll look for movement of blocks, the disappearance of existing objects, and the appearance of new ones (including the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32)). This will help us further define the conditions for its effects and move closer to verifying it.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board features several objects, notably a yellow and black object near the top-center, a smaller black and purple object below it, and some purple/cyan at the bottom right. There is also a small black and purple object at the bottom left. The repeated 'no effect' for ACTION4 suggests that either the conditions for its movement/reset effect were not met in the previous state, or no movable objects were 'selected' in the previous state. Moving to a new position with ACTION2 should change the selection/context, which might allow ACTION4 to have an effect."
