  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has been inconsistent, sometimes causing a reset and sometimes having no effect. It also had multiple recent 'no effect' attempts. The rule states that if an action had no effect and will be re-attempted, a setup sequence to move to a different position is required. None of the movement actions are yet verified, but they have shown consistent 'move object' behavior. Performing ACTION2 will move the selected block (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) which was involved in recent ACTION1 attempts, now at (48, 40) or (40, 24) or (16, 24)) to a new position, thus changing the game state. This new position might provide the necessary context for ACTION5 to have a consistent effect, or reveal new behavior. We choose ACTION2 as a movement action to change the state. We want to test ACTION5 multiple times to verify if it consistently resets the game in certain conditions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to gain more consistent observations about ACTION5. Specifically, we want to confirm if changing the position of the movable block, through a movement action from the 'pending' list, will make ACTION5 consistently reset the game. This will help to clarify the conditions under which ACTION5 acts as a 'reset' vs. having 'no effect'.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows several distinct objects, including multiple 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' pairs that appear to be movable. There is also a 'Color 8 64x64 block' and 'Color 4 irregular shape (64x64)' which were involved in a reset after ACTION5 previously. The recent successful ACTION1 on the 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' suggests this block is currently 'selected' or the primary interactable element. The current layout is suitable for movement actions to vary the position of this block."
