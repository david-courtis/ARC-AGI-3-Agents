  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had three consecutive 'no effect' attempts. This means we cannot test it again in the current state without a setup sequence to change the position. Since none of the movement actions (ACTION1-ACTION4) are verified, we cannot reliably use them for a setup sequence. Therefore, we should prioritize testing an unverified action that has not recently resulted in 'no effect'. ACTION1 has only 0/3 consistent observations and its last attempt was successful. It also has a complex definition related to specific objects at specific locations (the disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32)). Testing ACTION1 again directly in the current state might help clarify its conditions or provide another consistent observation towards its verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get another consistent observation for ACTION1 to move towards its verification. Specifically, we want to see if the described behavior regarding the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) is repeatable under similar conditions. This will help us understand the role of specific objects and their locations in triggering complex action effects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board currently contains several objects, including 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' at various locations, and 'Color 9 rectangular block (2x2)' and 'Color 12 rectangular block (2x2)' at relevant locations. The conditions for ACTION1's specific effects (disappearance of the 2x2 block) may depend on the arrangement of these objects. The current state is suitable for testing ACTION1, especially given the lack of verified movement actions for a reliable setup sequence."
