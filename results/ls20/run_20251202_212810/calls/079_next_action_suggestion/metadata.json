  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 9/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 generally moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). However, under specific and currently unknown conditions, ACTION1 can trigger a full game reset, similar to some instances of ACTION3 and ACTION5. When a reset occurs, existing objects disappear, and a new set of objects appear, often with a changed background and UI. The objects that were present before the reset may reappear in a different location as part of the new game state.\n  ACTION2: VERIFIED - ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 usually moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left. However, sometimes, it triggers a game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, similar to ACTION5 under certain, yet to be fully understood, conditions. When a game reset occurs, the objects that were 'selected' or 'involved' in the reset might also undergo a movement transformation as they appear in the new state.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided (and likely also when no game reset condition is met), has no effect. The specific conditions under which it acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action are still undefined but are more complex than simply the absence of a selected object.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 5 8x8 shape: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 3x3 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The movement of specified blocks is consistent with the 'Move RIGHT' interpretation of ACTION4.\n  - ACTION3 can, under certain conditions, trigger a full game reset, similar to how ACTION5 sometimes does.\n  - During a game reset caused by ACTION3, not only do existing objects disappear and new ones appear, but the objects that were 'involved' might also undergo a movement transformation as part of their reappearance on the new board.\n  - ACTION1 can also act as a full game reset under certain conditions.\n  - The conditions for ACTION1 triggering a game reset are currently unknown.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION2\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 had a 'no effect' earlier because the conditions (likely proximity to a specific object or screen position) were not met. We need to test it in a new position. Since ACTION2 is verified to move objects downwards, a sequence of ACTION2s will effectively change the position of the movable objects on the screen. This should provide a sufficiently different state to re-test if ACTION4 has an effect, particularly regarding its primary function (moving blocks right) and the secondary effect of creating the Color 9 rectangular block at (32,32). We're prioritizing ACTION4 over ACTION3 and ACTION5 because ACTION4 has more attempts and we have a clearer understanding of its potential effects (block movement, block creation). ACTION5 has had several 'no effects' and its conditions for triggering a reset are very unclear, making it less efficient to test without more context.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION4 moves the currently present movable blocks to the right. We also want to observe if the Color 9 rectangular block at (32,32) appears, and to clarify the conditions under which it appears. This will help us get closer to verifying ACTION4's primary and secondary effects.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has several movable objects. The most recent ACTION4 attempts resulted in a 'no effect', indicating that the previous positions were not suitable for observing its effects. We need to move these objects to a new location. There are no obvious 'interactable' objects for ACTION5, and ACTION3 has recently caused a reset, which is harder to predict and may not be the primary function. Therefore, moving the blocks using ACTION2 will create a good environment to re-test ACTION4's movement and object creation capabilities."
