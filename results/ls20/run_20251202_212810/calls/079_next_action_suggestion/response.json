  "reasoning": "ACTION4 had a 'no effect' earlier because the conditions (likely proximity to a specific object or screen position) were not met. We need to test it in a new position. Since ACTION2 is verified to move objects downwards, a sequence of ACTION2s will effectively change the position of the movable objects on the screen. This should provide a sufficiently different state to re-test if ACTION4 has an effect, particularly regarding its primary function (moving blocks right) and the secondary effect of creating the Color 9 rectangular block at (32,32). We're prioritizing ACTION4 over ACTION3 and ACTION5 because ACTION4 has more attempts and we have a clearer understanding of its potential effects (block movement, block creation). ACTION5 has had several 'no effects' and its conditions for triggering a reset are very unclear, making it less efficient to test without more context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION4 moves the currently present movable blocks to the right. We also want to observe if the Color 9 rectangular block at (32,32) appears, and to clarify the conditions under which it appears. This will help us get closer to verifying ACTION4's primary and secondary effects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has several movable objects. The most recent ACTION4 attempts resulted in a 'no effect', indicating that the previous positions were not suitable for observing its effects. We need to move these objects to a new location. There are no obvious 'interactable' objects for ACTION5, and ACTION3 has recently caused a reset, which is harder to predict and may not be the primary function. Therefore, moving the blocks using ACTION2 will create a good environment to re-test ACTION4's movement and object creation capabilities."
