If a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) is present at (32,32) WHEN ACTION1 is performed AND other objects are moved 'up', this specific 2x2 block will disappear.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (6 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 40).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved up to (47,40), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved up to (49,40).\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (42, 32). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION1 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved up to (39,32). A Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) also moved up to (41,32).

This is a newly observed interaction and overrides the previous idea of selection for ACTION1.\n  - ACTION2 can also cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move down, although the conditions for this appearance are unknown.\n  - ACTION1's effect on objects depends on their location and other objects present. Specifically, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) can disappear when ACTION1 is performed and causes other objects to move up.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 156 pixels changed.
