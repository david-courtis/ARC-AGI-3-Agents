Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:
"ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 40).
      Interpretation: When ACTION3 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved left to (48,39), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved left to (50,39).
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (8, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located below it at (10, 32). They were within the main play area.
      Interpretation: When ACTION3 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32) moved left to (8,31), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32) moved left to (10,31).

  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION4 can cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move right, similar to ACTION2. This suggests the appearance of this specific block is tied to the movement of other blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6), not necessarily the direction of movement, and is a side effect.
  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when other blocks move is inconsistent for ACTION4. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4 are still unknown, suggesting a more complex trigger than simple movement of other blocks.
  - ACTION4 does not always cause objects to move. There might be a selection mechanism or a requirement for 'selected' objects to be present to move.
  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when ACTION1 is taken is not guaranteed. There are as yet unknown conditions that cause its disappearance.
  - The appearance/disappearance logic for the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) is complex and tied to both ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION4, but with inconsistent triggers. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4, and its disappearance with ACTION1, are still unknown.
