  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION5.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION5:\n\"ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided, usually has no effect. However, under certain (as yet undefined) conditions, it can act as a 'reset' or 'new game' action, clearing the previous game state and generating a new one with various new objects and a changed UI.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (14 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 48). No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32). There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified for interaction. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (40, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (42, 32). Other various blocks and shapes were present. No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no selected object'.\n  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) suggests that objects of type Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at location (32,32) might be 'triggers' or automatically removed under certain conditions, specifically when ACTION1 is performed and other objects are moved upwards. This is a newly observed interaction and overrides the previous idea of selection for ACTION1.\n  - ACTION2 can also cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move down, although the conditions for this appearance are unknown.\n  - ACTION1's effect on objects depends on their location and other objects present. Specifically, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) can disappear when ACTION1 is performed and causes other objects to move up.\n  - The interaction where a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) disappears when ACTION1 causes adjacent blocks to move up is consistently reproducible.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
