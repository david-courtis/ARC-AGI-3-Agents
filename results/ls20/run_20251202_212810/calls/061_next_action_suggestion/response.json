  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no effect in 7 out of 8 attempts, including the most recent ones. According to the rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different state before retrying it. Since none of the movement actions are fully verified, I'm choosing a sequence that combines some known movements (ACTION1 and ACTION2 both have some consistent observations) to ensure we reach a new position. The goal is to retry ACTION5 in a different context to try and discover its 'reset' or 'new game' functionality, which is currently unknown. The chosen setup sequence combines moving objects up and then down, which should sufficiently alter the board state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We primarily expect to learn the conditions under which ACTION5 has an effect, specifically its reset or new game functionality. By trying it in a new board state, we might trigger a different outcome. We will also observe if the setup sequence itself behaves consistently, adding to the validation of ACTION1 and ACTION2.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows multiple interactive blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6) along with other static elements. ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in this and similar states. Changing the arrangement of the interactive blocks through a setup sequence is crucial to testing ACTION5's contextual effects."
