  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has 2/3 consistent observations and is therefore the closest to being verified. It also did not have a recent 'no effect' attempt. Although ACTION4 and ACTION5 have recent no-effect attempts, a setup sequence is only required when the action *itself* resulted in no effect. The current state is not problematic for testing ACTION2.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify ACTION2 by observing its effect on movable objects, specifically looking for downward movement and any interaction with the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board contains several rectangular blocks of different colors and sizes, some of which are likely movable. There's a prominent Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) that has been involved in previous actions. The complex interaction of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) with various actions is a key mystery to unravel."
