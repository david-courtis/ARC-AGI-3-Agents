  "interpretation": "When ACTION3 was taken, the entire game state reset. All previous objects largely disappeared, including the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48), and other blocks and shapes present in the previous frame. The background changed from green to orange, and the objects that appeared were a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32,48) that moved down and left to (33,47) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34,48) that moved down and left to (35,47) in the new background. This is a complete game reset, similar to what ACTION5 sometimes did.",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION3 usually moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left. However, sometimes, it triggers a game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, similar to ACTION5 under certain, yet to be fully understood, conditions. When a game reset occurs, the objects that were 'selected' or 'involved' in the reset might also undergo a movement transformation as they appear in the new state.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": false,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "Instead of moving two blocks to the left like in previous observations, the action caused a full game reset. This indicates that ACTION3, under specific, currently unknown circumstances, can behave like a 'reset' action, similar to some instances of ACTION5. The two blocks, originally at (32,48) and (34,48) seemingly moved down and left as part of their recalculation and reappearance on the new (reset) game board.",
