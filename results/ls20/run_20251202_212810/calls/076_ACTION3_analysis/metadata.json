  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:\n\"ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 40).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION3 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved left to (48,39), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved left to (50,39).\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (8, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located below it at (10, 32). They were within the main play area.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION3 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32) moved left to (8,31), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32) moved left to (10,31).\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (16, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (18, 48). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION3 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 48) moved left to (16,47), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 48) moved left to (18,47). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) remained unchanged.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The presence of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) does not cause it to disappear when ACTION3 is executed on other blocks.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) with ACTION2 is context-dependent and did not occur in this observation.\n  - The general movement down of the two larger blocks is consistent with the 'Move DOWN' interpretation of ACTION2.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when ACTION4 is executed is context-dependent and does not always occur.\n  - The movement of specified blocks is consistent with the 'Move RIGHT' interpretation of ACTION4.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 4088 pixels changed.

All previous objects largely disappeared, including the Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48) and the Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48), and other blocks and shapes present in the previous frame. The background changed from green to orange, and the objects that appeared were a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32,48) that moved down and left to (33,47) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34,48) that moved down and left to (35,47) in the new background.

    "new_definition": "ACTION3 usually moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left. However, sometimes, it triggers a game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, similar to ACTION5 under certain, yet to be fully understood, conditions. When a game reset occurs, the objects that were 'selected' or 'involved' in the reset might also undergo a movement transformation as they appear in the new state.",

    "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "Instead of moving two blocks to the left like in previous observations, the action caused a full game reset. This indicates that ACTION3, under specific, currently unknown circumstances, can behave like a 'reset' action, similar to some instances of ACTION5. The two blocks, originally at (32,48) and (34,48) seemingly moved down and left as part of their recalculation and reappearance on the new (reset) game board.",
