Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:
"ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 40).
      Interpretation: When ACTION3 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved left to (48,39), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved left to (50,39).
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (8, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located below it at (10, 32). They were within the main play area.
      Interpretation: When ACTION3 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32) moved left to (8,31), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32) moved left to (10,31).
  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (16, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located directly below it at (18, 48). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) was also present at (32, 32).
      Interpretation: When ACTION3 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 48) moved left to (16,47), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 48) moved left to (18,47). A Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) remained unchanged.

  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - The presence of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) does not cause it to disappear when ACTION3 is executed on other blocks.
  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) with ACTION2 is context-dependent and did not occur in this observation.
  - The general movement down of the two larger blocks is consistent with the 'Move DOWN' interpretation of ACTION2.
  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when ACTION4 is executed is context-dependent and does not always occur.
  - The movement of specified blocks is consistent with the 'Move RIGHT' interpretation of ACTION4.
