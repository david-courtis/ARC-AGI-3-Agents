  "reasoning": "ACTION4 had a 'no effect' attempt recently. According to the rules, I must move to a different position before retesting. ACTION2 is a verified movement action and will change the state. After moving, ACTION4 is still a high priority action to validate. We need to reach 3 consistent observations for ACTION4. The current knowledge status for ACTION4 suggests it causes movement to the right, and we need more trials to confirm this behavior and understand any conditions that lead to its 'no effect' behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION4 consistently moves selected blocks one unit to the right in a new position, or if it further reveals conditions where it has no effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, while not explicitly problematic for testing ACTION4, needs to be changed because ACTION4 recently had a 'no effect' result. We have sufficient movable objects present to test movement."
