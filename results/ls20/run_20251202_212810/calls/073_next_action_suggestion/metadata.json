  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 8/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). The presence and movement of other objects specifically impacts whether a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) appears, disappears, or remains.\n  ACTION2: VERIFIED - ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided (and likely also when no game reset condition is met), has no effect. The specific conditions under which it acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action are still undefined but are more complex than simply the absence of a selected object.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when ACTION1 is taken is not guaranteed. There are as yet unknown conditions that cause its disappearance.\n  - The appearance/disappearance logic for the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) is complex and tied to both ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION4, but with inconsistent triggers. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4, and its disappearance with ACTION1, are still unknown.\n  - The presence of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) does not cause it to disappear when ACTION3 is executed on other blocks.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) with ACTION2 is context-dependent and did not occur in this observation.\n  - The general movement down of the two larger blocks is consistent with the 'Move DOWN' interpretation of ACTION2.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION2\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 had a 'no effect' attempt recently. According to the rules, I must move to a different position before retesting. ACTION2 is a verified movement action and will change the state. After moving, ACTION4 is still a high priority action to validate. We need to reach 3 consistent observations for ACTION4. The current knowledge status for ACTION4 suggests it causes movement to the right, and we need more trials to confirm this behavior and understand any conditions that lead to its 'no effect' behavior.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION4 consistently moves selected blocks one unit to the right in a new position, or if it further reveals conditions where it has no effect.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, while not explicitly problematic for testing ACTION4, needs to be changed because ACTION4 recently had a 'no effect' result. We have sufficient movable objects present to test movement."
