  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 only has 0/3 consistent observations and has recently been observed to have an effect (1 success out of 3 attempts). Although there has been a recent successful outcome, it still needs more validation. ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 have higher consistency than ACTION4 but are closer to being verified already compared to ACTION4. ACTION5 had no effect in the current state recently, so it should not be tested again without a setup sequence. Testing ACTION4 next allows us to gather more data for this less consistent action without needing a setup sequence.",
  "expected_information_gain": "More observations of ACTION4's effects, hopefully leading to consistent observations and a better definition of its behavior, including scenarios where the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) appears at (32,32).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has movable objects (Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)) that have reacted to ACTION4 recently. This state is suitable for further testing ACTION4."
