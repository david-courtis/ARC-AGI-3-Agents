  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has been attempted multiple times recently (3 recent no-effect attempts) and consistently had no effect. This strongly suggests that the environmental context is not suitable for ACTION5. Therefore, we must perform a setup sequence to change the game state significantly before retrying ACTION5. Since we have no fully verified movement actions yet, we'll use a sequence of different movement actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3) which have shown some effect in the past, to alter the position of the movable objects and potentially create a new context where ACTION5 might be effective. These are the actions with at least one observed effect among the non-verified ones. We are aiming to explore if ACTION5 requires proximity to a specific object or a 'selected' state. By moving the existing movable objects around, we hope to inadvertently create such a condition.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing a setup sequence involving several movement actions and then attempting ACTION5, we hope to either: 1. Finally observe an effect of ACTION5, providing crucial information about its functionality and required context. 2. Confirm that even after significant movement of other objects, ACTION5 still has no effect, suggesting a different activation condition (e.g., a specific selection mechanism not yet discovered or a 'current position' needing interaction).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows several blocks, including a prominent cyan-topped purple block in the upper middle area, and a smaller black and purple L-shaped block near the bottom left. The previous attempts of ACTION5 have had no effect, indicating that the current state does not present a valid 'interaction' context. The last observed effects for movement actions involved the cyan-topped purple block and the black and purple L-shaped block."
