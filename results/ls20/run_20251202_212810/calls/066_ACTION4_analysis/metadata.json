  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:\n\"ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (4 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (8, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located below it at (10, 24). They were within the main play area.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24) moved right to (8,25), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24) moved right to (10,25).\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (32, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (34, 32). These are the same positions as the previous ACTION2 observation where the same 2x2 block appeared, only the movement direction is different.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32) moved right to (32,33), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32) moved right to (34,33). Concurrently, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) which was not explicitly part of the initial movable object context, appeared at (32, 32).\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (24, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (26, 40).\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 40) moved right to (24,41), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 40) moved right to (26,41). No other object appeared or disappeared in this instance.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION1's effect on objects depends on their location and other objects present. Specifically, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) can disappear when ACTION1 is performed and causes other objects to move up.\n  - The interaction where a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) disappears when ACTION1 causes adjacent blocks to move up is consistently reproducible.\n  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no specific object selected' and the current context for that is still unknown.\n  - ACTION4 can cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move right, similar to ACTION2. This suggests the appearance of this specific block is tied to the movement of other blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6), not necessarily the direction of movement, and is a side effect.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when other blocks move is inconsistent for ACTION4. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4 are still unknown, suggesting a more complex trigger than simple movement of other blocks.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
