    "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been observed even once, making it the highest priority for initial testing. It's crucial to gather a first observation for all actions.",

    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing basic movement actions as there appear to be movable objects present. There's ample space for movement in various directions."
