Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value)."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 32).
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32) moved right to (48,33), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32) moved right to (50,33).
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (8, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located below it at (10, 24). They were within the main play area.
      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24) moved right to (8,25), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24) moved right to (10,25).

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) suggests that objects of type Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at location (32,32) might be 'triggers' or automatically removed under certain conditions, specifically when ACTION1 is performed and other objects are moved upwards. This is a newly observed interaction and overrides the previous idea of selection for ACTION1.
  - ACTION2 can also cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move down, although the conditions for this appearance are unknown.
  - ACTION1's effect on objects depends on their location and other objects present. Specifically, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) can disappear when ACTION1 is performed and causes other objects to move up.
  - The interaction where a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) disappears when ACTION1 causes adjacent blocks to move up is consistently reproducible.
  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no specific object selected' and the current context for that is still unknown.
