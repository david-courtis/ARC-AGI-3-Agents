There were no obstructions to the right of these objects. The appearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) is a new side-effect of ACTION4, similar to ACTION2 but not seen with ACTION4 previously. This suggests that the appearance of this specific block is tied to the movement of other specific blocks, not necessarily the direction of movement.",

This suggests the appearance of this specific block is tied to the movement of other blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6), not necessarily the direction of movement, and is a side effect."
