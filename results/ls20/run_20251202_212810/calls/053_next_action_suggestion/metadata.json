  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 6/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves one or more selected objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). If a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) is present at (32,32) WHEN ACTION1 is performed AND other objects are moved 'up', this specific 2x2 block will disappear.\n  ACTION2: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided, usually has no effect. However, under certain (as yet undefined) conditions, it can act as a 'reset' or 'new game' action, clearing the previous game state and generating a new one with various new objects and a changed UI.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 can cause a complete game reset, including new object generation and UI changes, if no specific interaction context is present.\n  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no selected object'.\n  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) suggests that objects of type Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at location (32,32) might be 'triggers' or automatically removed under certain conditions, specifically when ACTION1 is performed and other objects are moved upwards. This is a newly observed interaction and overrides the previous idea of selection for ACTION1.\n  - ACTION2 can also cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move down, although the conditions for this appearance are unknown.\n  - ACTION1's effect on objects depends on their location and other objects present. Specifically, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) can disappear when ACTION1 is performed and causes other objects to move up.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has a complex and context-dependent behavior, sometimes leading to a game reset, and other times having no effect. It has also recently had several 'no effect' attempts. This suggests that its effect is highly dependent on the current game state and potentially specific object configurations. The critical rule states that if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first. We need to test ACTION5 from a different configuration to determine the conditions under which it resets the game or has other effects. Since ACTION2 is almost verified and moves objects downwards, it's a good candidate to use as a setup sequence to change the game state before testing ACTION5 again. This will help us avoid repeating the 'no effect' result and potentially uncover new conditions for ACTION5. Additionally, getting ACTION2 verified is also a priority.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to understand the conditions under which ACTION5 triggers a game reset or other effects, moving beyond its 'no effect' behavior in the current unspecific context. By using ACTION2 as a setup, we also expect to get ACTION2 verified and understand its interaction with the environment, specifically the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32).",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, after multiple attempts, has shown that ACTION5 frequently has no effect. The movement actions (ACTION1-ACTION4) tend to move specific blocks. We need to systematically vary the game state to fully understand ACTION5. There are multiple movable blocks on the screen, which can be acted upon by movement actions."
