  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has had multiple 'no effect' attempts recently, indicating that the previous states were not conducive to its effects. To try and find a state where it might have an effect, we need to move to a new position. Since ACTION2 is verified, we can safely use it to change the position of the movable objects. By testing ACTION4 after a known move, we can ideally observe its effect or gain more information about the conditions under which it acts as a reset or moves blocks.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe a non-'no effect' outcome for ACTION4. This could be either a block movement or a game reset. If it moves blocks, we can start to verify what blocks it affects and how. If it causes a reset, we'll gain more consistent observations about its reset behavior compared to ACTION1 and ACTION3.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, while not providing any specific hints for ACTION4's context, is unsuitable for re-testing ACTION4 due to its recent 'no effect' history in similar states. A change in position is necessary to gather new data points for ACTION4."
