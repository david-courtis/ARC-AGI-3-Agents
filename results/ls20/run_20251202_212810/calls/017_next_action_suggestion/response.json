  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had 'no effect' in its recent attempts. According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, it must be re-tested from a different position. Since no actions are yet verified, I am using ACTION1 as a tentative setup action based on its semantic hint of moving 'up' and its observed effect of moving an object. Executing ACTION1 multiple times will move the 'selected' object to a sufficiently different position before attempting ACTION5 again.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION5 after a significant change in position, we aim to discover if ACTION5 is context-dependent and requires a specific location or interaction opportunity to have an effect. This will help us understand its true function and potentially verify it.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board currently shows a 'selected' object (the Color 12 rectangular block) which has responded to directional actions. ACTION5 has not shown any effect so far, suggesting it might be context-dependent. The current position has led to 'no effect' for ACTION5 repeatedly, making it a bad state to re-test ACTION5 without moving."
