    "reasoning": "ACTION5 resulted in 'NO EFFECT' in its last attempt. Therefore, according to the rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying it. Since no actions are yet verified, we'll pick an unverified movement action for the setup sequence. ACTION3 is chosen arbitrarily for movement. After the movement, we will test ACTION5 again to see if the new context enables it.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Verify if ACTION5's effect is context-dependent, specifically if moving to a new position allows it to have an effect. This will also provide another observation for ACTION3.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The game board shows several blocks. The previous ACTION5 attempt had no effect, indicating it might require a specific object to be selected or to be in a certain proximity to an object. Moving to a new position, potentially closer to other objects, might change the context for ACTION5."
