  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 7/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). If a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) is present at (32,32) when ACTION1 is performed AND other objects are moved 'up', this specific 2x2 block will disappear.\n  ACTION2: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided (and likely also when no game reset condition is met), has no effect. The specific conditions under which it acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action are still undefined but are more complex than simply the absence of a selected object.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The interaction where a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) disappears when ACTION1 causes adjacent blocks to move up is consistently reproducible.\n  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no specific object selected' and the current context for that is still unknown.\n  - ACTION4 can cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move right, similar to ACTION2. This suggests the appearance of this specific block is tied to the movement of other blocks (Color 12 8x2 and Color 9 8x6), not necessarily the direction of movement, and is a side effect.\n  - The appearance/disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) when other blocks move is inconsistent for ACTION4. The specific conditions for its appearance with ACTION2 and ACTION4 are still unknown, suggesting a more complex trigger than simple movement of other blocks.\n  - ACTION4 does not always cause objects to move. There might be a selection mechanism or a requirement for 'selected' objects to be present to move.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 failed to produce an effect on its last attempt but has produced effects in the past. It needs to reach 3 consistent observations to be verified. Since there's only one recent no-effect attempt, and the 'no effect' condition for ACTION4 is still being investigated (i.e. 'not always causing objects to move'), it is reasonable to retest it at the current state, without a setup sequence for now. We prioritize validating partially known actions.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Further clarity on the conditions under which ACTION4 causes objects to move or not move. Specifically, whether the absence of a 'selected' object is the cause of the no-effect, or if the initial state contains the necessary objects for movement, but the conditions are otherwise not met for movement, or if there's a specific 'selection mechanism' that needs to be triggered first. We want to observe if objects move and if the 2x2 block at (32,32) appears or disappears, and understand the consistency and conditions of these effects.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various objects, including Color 12 and Color 9 blocks, which have been involved in ACTION4's observed effects. There are also other static objects that may or may not be relevant to ACTION4. There is no explicit 'selected' object shown, which might be why ACTION4 recently had no effect. However, ACTION4 has had effects in previous varied states, so the current state might still yield new information for ACTION4."
