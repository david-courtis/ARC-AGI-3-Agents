  "reasoning": "ACTION4 failed to produce an effect on its last attempt but has produced effects in the past. It needs to reach 3 consistent observations to be verified. Since there's only one recent no-effect attempt, and the 'no effect' condition for ACTION4 is still being investigated (i.e. 'not always causing objects to move'), it is reasonable to retest it at the current state, without a setup sequence for now. We prioritize validating partially known actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further clarity on the conditions under which ACTION4 causes objects to move or not move. Specifically, whether the absence of a 'selected' object is the cause of the no-effect, or if the initial state contains the necessary objects for movement, but the conditions are otherwise not met for movement, or if there's a specific 'selection mechanism' that needs to be triggered first. We want to observe if objects move and if the 2x2 block at (32,32) appears or disappears, and understand the consistency and conditions of these effects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various objects, including Color 12 and Color 9 blocks, which have been involved in ACTION4's observed effects. There are also other static objects that may or may not be relevant to ACTION4. There is no explicit 'selected' object shown, which might be why ACTION4 recently had no effect. However, ACTION4 has had effects in previous varied states, so the current state might still yield new information for ACTION4."
