Despite being present and normally movable, they did not move to the right. There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified, and no obvious obstruction to the right. This situation indicates that either these specific blocks were not currently 'selected' or 'active' for movement, or there are other unknown conditions preventing their movement despite sufficient open space.",
