However, in certain contexts, it can also cause other adjacent objects to disappear or be 'destroyed'.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had 'NO EFFECT' in its last three attempts. According to the critical rules, if an action had 'NO EFFECT' recently, a setup sequence to move first is mandatory. Since no movement actions are verified, we will use an unverified movement action for the setup sequence. ACTION3 has only been tried once and resulted in an effect, making it a good candidate for diversifying our position. After moving, we will re-test ACTION5 to see if its behavior changes in a new state, potentially revealing context-dependent functionality.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION3, we expect to further clarify its effect and potentially discover a new state. After moving, testing ACTION5 in a new position will help us determine if its lack of effect was context-dependent or if it truly has no function in the game. We are hoping to get a new or consistent observation for ACTION5.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has a few distinct objects, but the exact selection mechanism is unclear. There's a prominent Color 12 rectangular block which seems to be the target of previous actions. The repeated 'NO EFFECT' for ACTION5 suggests it might require a specific context or proximity to an object, which the current state does not provide in the tested conditions."
