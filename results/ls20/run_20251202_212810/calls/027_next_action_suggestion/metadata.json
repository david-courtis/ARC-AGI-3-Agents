However, in certain contexts, it can also cause other adjacent objects to disappear or be 'destroyed'.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 0 consistent observations and 0/3 needed for verification. Also, it has recently had no effect, and the rules state, 'If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first.' However, since there are no VERIFIED actions, we cannot form a setup sequence. Therefore, the only available option is to try ACTION5 again, hoping that the context has changed or that a different object will be selected or interacted with.",
    "expected_information_gain": "To observe the effect of ACTION5 on the game state. We want to understand what 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position' means in this game, especially if it affects the visible blocks or other game elements.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The board currently displays several blocks and is in a state where ACTION5 could potentially interact with or select one of them. While ACTION5 had no effect multiple times previously, we have no verified movement actions to alter the environment, making a direct re-attempt of ACTION5 the only method to move forward in exploration. The position is considered 'good' for testing ACTION5 as there are interactive elements present."
