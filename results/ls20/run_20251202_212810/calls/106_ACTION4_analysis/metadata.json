  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:\n\"ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). Under certain, currently unknown, conditions, ACTION4 can trigger a full game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, and the two affected blocks to reappear with a movement transformation (right movement combined with an 'appearance' effect for the new board). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (14 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (50, 48). Other various blocks and shapes were present. No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously. The background was green.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was located at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was located at (50, 40). The background was green. Other various blocks and shapes were present.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION4 was taken, a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved right to (48,41), and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved right to (50,41). No game reset occurred, and no Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) appeared.\n  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (48, 48) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (50, 48). Other various blocks and shapes were present. No explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' was identified. This observation was taken after a 'game reset' caused by ACTION5 previously.

It appears to be linked to the background, whether it's the green or orange background, or a more precise placement and type of objects around it. Further observation will be needed.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
