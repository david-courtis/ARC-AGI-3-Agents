Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 7/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). If a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) is present at (32,32) when ACTION1 is performed AND other objects are moved 'up', this specific 2x2 block will disappear.
  ACTION2: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value).
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided, usually has no effect. However, under certain (as yet undefined) conditions, it can act as a 'reset' or 'new game' action, clearing the previous game state and generating a new one with various new objects and a changed UI.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - The condition that causes ACTION5 to trigger a game reset is more complex than simply 'no selected object'.
  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) suggests that objects of type Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at location (32,32) might be 'triggers' or automatically removed under certain conditions, specifically when ACTION1 is performed and other objects are moved upwards. This is a newly observed interaction and overrides the previous idea of selection for ACTION1.
  - ACTION2 can also cause a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) to appear at (32, 32) when other blocks move down, although the conditions for this appearance are unknown.
  - ACTION1's effect on objects depends on their location and other objects present. Specifically, a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) can disappear when ACTION1 is performed and causes other objects to move up.
  - The interaction where a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32) disappears when ACTION1 causes adjacent blocks to move up is consistently reproducible.
