  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 3 recent 'NO EFFECT' attempts. According to the rules, if an action had no effect recently, we must use a setup sequence to move first. However, none of the movement actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) are 'verified' yet, meaning we cannot reliably use them for a setup sequence. Therefore, the priority remains to test ACTION5 to try and get it verified or understand its trigger conditions. Since we cannot move reliably with unverified actions, we must test ACTION5 again in the current state to try and observe its effect if its specific trigger condition is met.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe what causes ACTION5 to have an effect (reset the game state) and thus get closer to verifying its behavior. Alternatively, if it fails again, it further emphasizes the need to understand its trigger conditions or find a different state where it might apply.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is complex with various objects. There are no clear 'selected' objects or obvious 'interaction' points that are typically associated with ACTION5. The critical piece of knowledge needed for ACTION5 is to identify the conditions under which it resets the game, which previously occurred. There is no clear indication that the current state is 'bad' for testing ACTION5, as its trigger is unknown."
