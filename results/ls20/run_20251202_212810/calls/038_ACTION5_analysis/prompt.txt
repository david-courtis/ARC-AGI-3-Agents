Analyze the effect of action ACTION5.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION5:
"ACTION5, when no specific object is selected or at a current interaction position, has no visible effect. It is hypothesized that ACTION5 requires a 'selected' object or a 'current position' to perform an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (9 total):
  [1] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32). There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified for interaction.
      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.
  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24). There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified for interaction.
      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.
  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 32). There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified for interaction.
      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action
