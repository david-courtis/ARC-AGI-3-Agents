  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION5.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION5:\n\"ACTION5, when no specific object is selected or at a current interaction position, has no visible effect. It is hypothesized that ACTION5 requires a 'selected' object or a 'current position' to perform an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (9 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32). There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified for interaction.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24).
