  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the rules, we must use a setup sequence of verified movement actions to reach a different position before retesting an action that previously had no effect. Since no actions are verified yet, but we have some understanding of ACTION1-4, I'm choosing a sequence to move the 'agent' (which seems to be the black L-shaped object) to a different location. I will move it up once and left once from its current position to try to vary the context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We want to see if ACTION5 has an effect in a different part of the game board. It might be an 'interact' action that requires proximity to a specific object. By moving to a new position, we increase the chances of finding such a context.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows a black L-shaped object in the bottom left, which appears to be the 'agent' or controlled entity. There are several other colored blocks. ACTION5 has been tried twice without effect. The definitions for ACTION1-4 suggest they move objects, not necessarily the agent, but it's the best available information to construct a 'movement' setup sequence."
