  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has the most recent effect, and it is not verified. Since it is not a no-effect action, we can try to validate its behavior and narrow down the conditions that cause a reset versus regular movement. It also has a contextual effect (disappearance of a block) that needs further investigation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe ACTION1's effect again, hopefully moving an object or causing a game reset. This will help us gather more consistent observations for ACTION1 and differentiate between its two known behaviors (moving objects vs. game reset), and understand the conditions under which a specific block might disappear.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various objects, which provides potential targets for actions. There is no immediate reason to use a setup sequence for ACTION1 as it has not recently had 'no effect'."
