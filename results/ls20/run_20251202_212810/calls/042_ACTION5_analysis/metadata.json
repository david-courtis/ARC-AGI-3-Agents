  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION5.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION5:\n\"ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided, acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action, clearing the previous game state and generating a new one with various new objects and a changed UI.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (10 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24). There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified for interaction.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Multiple objects were present, including a Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 32) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 32). There was no explicit selection mechanism or 'current position' identified for interaction.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, no visible changes occurred in the environment. This action had no effect on any objects.\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: A Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) was at (48, 40) and a Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) was at (50, 40) in a predominantly orange background. There were no explicit indicators of selection or interaction points.\n      Interpretation: When ACTION5 was taken, the entire game state reset. All previous objects disappeared, and many new objects appeared, including a large background object and several smaller blocks/shapes. The UI elements also changed significantly. This suggests ACTION5 acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action when no specific object or interaction point is active.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 can cause a complete game reset, including new object generation and UI changes, if no specific interaction context is present.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",
