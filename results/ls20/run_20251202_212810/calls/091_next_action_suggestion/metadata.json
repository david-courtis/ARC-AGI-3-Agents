  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 10/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 generally moves one or more selected/interactive objects one unit 'up' (decreasing its row/y coordinate). However, under specific and currently unknown conditions, ACTION1 can trigger a full game reset, similar to some instances of ACTION3 and ACTION5. When a reset occurs, existing objects disappear, and a new set of objects appear, often with a changed background and UI. The objects that were present before the reset may reappear in a different location as part of the new game state.\n  ACTION2: VERIFIED - ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 usually moves selected blocks (or all movable blocks) one unit to the left. However, sometimes, it triggers a game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, similar to ACTION5 under certain, yet to be fully understood, conditions. When a game reset occurs, the objects that were 'selected' or 'involved' in the reset might also undergo a movement transformation as they appear in the new state.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 6/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 causes selected blocks to move one unit to the right (increase column/x value). Under certain, currently unknown, conditions, ACTION4 can trigger a full game reset, causing all existing objects to disappear and new ones to appear, and the two affected blocks to reappear with a movement transformation (right movement combined with an 'appearance' effect for the new board). The appearance of a Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) may or may not occur as a side effect, depending on unknown conditions.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5, when no specific object is implicitly or explicitly selected, and no specific interaction point is provided (and likely also when no game reset condition is met), has no effect. The specific conditions under which it acts as a 'reset' or 'new game' action are still undefined but are more complex than simply the absence of a selected object.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (16, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (18, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 24): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 32): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (64x64): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 3 irregular shape (48x48): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 4 rectangular block (8x16): Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 5 8x8 shape: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 2x2 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 3x3 block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 3 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 52): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (18, 34): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (3x3) at (54, 1): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 12: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 17: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 22: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 27: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 32: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 37: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 3 4x1 block at row 62, col 42: Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION1 can also act as a full game reset under certain conditions.\n  - The conditions for ACTION1 triggering a game reset are currently unknown.\n  - ACTION4 can sometimes trigger a full game reset, similar to ACTION1 and ACTION3, and specific instances of ACTION5. The conditions for this full game reset are still unknown.\n  - When a full game reset occurs, objects that were present before the reset may reappear in transformed positions as part of the new game state (i.e., a 'moved' state after reset).\n  - The disappearance of the Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32,32) with ACTION1 is highly contextual and does not occur in all instances where other blocks move up.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION2\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 has three recent 'no effect' attempts. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a new position before retesting an action that previously had no effect. ACTION2 is a verified movement action that causes selected objects to move downwards. By executing ACTION2 first, we aim to change the game state, specifically the position of the movable objects, thereby creating a new context for ACTION4. This increases the likelihood of observing an effect for ACTION4, helping to validate or further define its behavior. We prioritize ACTION4 as it has more pending attempts than ACTION3 and ACTION5, and could potentially yield more critical information about its game reset conditions.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe an effect from ACTION4, either a 'move right' action as sometimes defined, or a game reset. If it moves an object, we will gain another observation towards verifying its movement properties. If it resets the game, we will have another data point for understanding the conditions that trigger game resets for ACTION4. The main goal is to break the 'no effect' streak and gain new information about ACTION4's behavior in a different state.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, after multiple 'no effect' instances for ACTION4 and ACTION1, appears to be a context where direct re-testing of these actions is unproductive. There are several interactive objects that might be affected by movement actions. Changing the position of these objects using a verified action (ACTION2) is crucial to provide a fresh context for testing ACTION4 and potentially uncovering its intended effect or clarifying its reset conditions."
