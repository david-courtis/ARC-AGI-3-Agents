However, in certain contexts, it can also cause other adjacent objects to disappear or be 'destroyed'.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a selected movable object (or objects) to move downwards by one unit (pixel/cell).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect recently, indicating that the current state is not suitable for testing it. We need to move to a different position. Since no actions are yet verified, we will use known effective actions to move. ACTION1 has shown some effect, but it has not been sufficiently validated yet. By moving using ACTION4 then ACTION2, we vary the position of the currently selected movable object and then test ACTION1 again to gain more observations and work towards verifying it, while avoiding re-testing a no-effect action in the same state.",
    "expected_information_gain": "This action should provide further insight into the behavior of ACTION1, specifically how it affects objects in a new position and whether the 'destroy' effect is consistent or context-dependent. We hope to get closer to 3 consistent observations for ACTION1.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current game state has a selected movable object. ACTION5 is not having an effect in this state. The other actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) have shown some effect, indicating they likely move the selected object. To properly test ACTION5 or get more information on other actions, we need to change the position of the selected object."
