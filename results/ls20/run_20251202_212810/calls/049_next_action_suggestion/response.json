  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had multiple recent 'no effect' attempts and needs a positional change, but we don't have enough verified movement actions to reliably change position yet. Also, testing an action that has some consistency (e.g., ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, which all have 1/3 consistent observations) is a priority to get them verified. ACTION2, in particular, affects the 'Color 12 rectangular block (8x2)' and 'Color 9 rectangular block (8x6)' which are present on the screen in various locations. Since we lack verified movement, we prioritize trying to verify an action that has shown some effect before in the current general state. ACTION2 is chosen as it's next in the list of partially verified actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe another instance of ACTION2 moving the selected movable object(s) downwards, pushing it closer to being verified (2/3 consistent).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains multiple movable blocks that could be affected by directional movement actions. There is no specific setup needed to test ACTION2, and there is no indication that the current position is bad for it. We have a good chance to gain another consistent observation for ACTION2."
