  "reasoning": "The player is positioned at (4,3), directly adjacent to the Goal tile at (4,2), and possesses the required Key (visible in inventory). While side-movement (ACTION3) needs verification, testing the Goal interaction is a higher priority to understand the level completion conditions and confirm if the standard 'Move UP' action (ACTION1) triggers the unlock mechanism.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm the 'Lock and Key' mechanic: specifically, that moving into the Goal tile with the key consumes the key and completes the level or opens the path. This verifies the interaction logic for goal objects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Player is at (4,3) on Muted Green floor. Goal is at (4,2) (North). Key is in inventory. Path is clear. The state is optimal for attempting to solve the stage."
