  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: VERIFIED - Move UP 8 pixels. If target tile contains a Collectible (Color 9/Purple Debris), collect it (remove from map, update inventory) and move into the space.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player character DOWN by 8 pixels (1 grid unit). Consumes 1 move resource.\n  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the RIGHT (Positive X direction). Requires open floor (Color 3) in the target space.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Bright Green (Color 1)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 1))\n  Description: The play area is surrounded by a solid Bright Green void/wall color. Any movement into this color is blocked.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  8x8 Pixel Grid. Current room allows movement on Muted Green floor. Player is at Grid (4,3). Goal is at Grid (4,2). Hole is at Grid (2,2-2,3).\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A grid-based puzzle game involving resource management (move counter) and item collection. The player must navigate a room with obstacles (walls, holes), collect necessary items (keys), and reach a specific goal tile (lock) to progress, all within a limited number of steps.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.\n  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.\n  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.\n  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.\n  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.\n  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.\n  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).\n  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).\n  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.\n  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).\n  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.\n  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.\n  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.\n  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.\n  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.\n  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.\n  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.\n  - Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).\n  - Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.\n  - Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.\n  - Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The specific interaction result with the Yellow Goal tile.\n  - The function of the orange UI elements in the top right.\n  - The meaning of the grey dashes in the bottom right.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.\n  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).\n  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.\n  - Player movement is locked to 8-pixel grid steps.\n  - Movement consumes 'Move Counter' resources.\n  - Player confined to Muted Green (Color 3) regions.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas (walls/holes).\n  - Movement is quantized to 8 pixels per action.\n  - Movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter resource.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Debris at (4,4) likely blocks direct Northward movement from (4,5).\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas.\n  - Movement consumes 1 Top-UI resource.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel steps.\n  - Movement is quantized effectively to the 8x8 grid.\n  - Successful movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2\n  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)\n  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area\n  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)\n  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid\n  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)\n  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3\n  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle\n  - Rectangular Void (Hole) at Grid Column 2, spanning Rows 2 and 3\n  - Debris Object at Grid (4,4) likely acts as an obstacle or interactable block\n  - Rectangular Hole/Void (Bright Green) at Grid Column 2, Rows 2-3\n  - The play area boundaries define a specific room shape (approx 6x5 walkable area)\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Player Character: Purple body, Cyan top, Black feet 8x8 composite block (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: Controlled by actions, moved 8 pixels North in the last step.\n  - Goal / Lock: Yellow background, Purple symbol 8x8 square block (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Located at visible end of path (4,2). Symbol matches the collected Key icon. Player is now adjacent to it.\n  - Inventory Icon: Purple symbol on Black stand Small icon in bottom-left UI (Role hypothesis: ui_element)\n      Evidence: Appeared after collecting the debris/key. Persists across frames.\n  - Move Counter: Red/Grey dots Row of small squares at top UI (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)\n      Evidence: Updates (decrements) with every successful move action.\n  - Hole / Void: Bright Green Vertical Rectangle (8x16 pixels) (Role hypothesis: obstacle)\n      Evidence: Internal area of the background color within the room layout.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Will moving UP into the Goal tile trigger a standard level completion or require a specific 'Use' command?\n  - Does the Goal tile consume the Key from the inventory?\n  - What do the orange squares in the top right UI represent?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Debris (Row 4, Col 4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Bottom UI Element: Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Moving into Debris clears it from the map.\n  - Clearing Debris triggers a state change in the Bottom-Left UI (likely counting keys or score).\n  - The path to the Goal (Row 2, Col 4) is now clear.\n  - Confirmed Grid (4,3) is valid walkable floor.\n  - Observations confirm that ACTION1 functions as a standard 'Move Up' in empty space, in addition to its object-interaction properties observed previously.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",
