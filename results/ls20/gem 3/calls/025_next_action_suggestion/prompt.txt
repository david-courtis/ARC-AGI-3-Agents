=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

=== STAGE/LEVEL INFO ===
Current Stage: 1 (score: 0/254)
Actions in this stage: 9

ACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):
  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)
  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)
  ACTION3: Move LEFT (decrease column/x)
  ACTION4: Move RIGHT (increase column/x)

⚠️ NOTE: Only 4 actions are available in this game: ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: VERIFIED - Move UP 8 pixels. If target tile contains a Collectible (Color 9/Purple Debris), collect it (remove from map, update inventory) and move into the space.
  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player character DOWN by 8 pixels (1 grid unit). Consumes 1 move resource.
  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the RIGHT (Positive X direction). Requires open floor (Color 3) in the target space.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Bright Green (Color 1)

BORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 1))
  Description: The play area is surrounded by a solid Bright Green void/wall color. Any movement into this color is blocked.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  8x8 Pixel Grid. Current room allows movement on Muted Green floor. Player is at Grid (4,3). Goal is at Grid (4,2). Hole is at Grid (2,2-2,3).

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A grid-based puzzle game involving resource management (move counter) and item collection. The player must navigate a room with obstacles (walls, holes), collect necessary items (keys), and reach a specific goal tile (lock) to progress, all within a limited number of steps.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.
  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.
  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).
  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.
  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.
  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.
  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.
  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.
  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).
  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.
  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).
  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).
  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).
  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.
  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).
  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.
  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.
  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.
  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.
  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.
  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.
  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.
  - Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).
  - Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.
  - Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.
  - Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The specific interaction result with the Yellow Goal tile.
  - The function of the orange UI elements in the top right.
  - The meaning of the grey dashes in the bottom right.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).
  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.
  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.
  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.
  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).
  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.
  - Player movement is locked to 8-pixel grid steps.
  - Movement consumes 'Move Counter' resources.
  - Player confined to Muted Green (Color 3) regions.
  - Player constrained to Muted Green floor tiles.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas (walls/holes).
  - Movement is quantized to 8 pixels per action.
  - Movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter resource.
  - Player constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.
  - Debris at (4,4) likely blocks direct Northward movement from (4,5).
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas.
  - Movement consumes 1 Top-UI resource.
  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel steps.
  - Movement is quantized effectively to the 8x8 grid.
  - Successful movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2
  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)
  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area
  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)
  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid
  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)
  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3
  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle
  - Rectangular Void (Hole) at Grid Column 2, spanning Rows 2 and 3
  - Debris Object at Grid (4,4) likely acts as an obstacle or interactable block
  - Rectangular Hole/Void (Bright Green) at Grid Column 2, Rows 2-3
  - The play area boundaries define a specific room shape (approx 6x5 walkable area)

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Player Character: Purple body, Cyan top, Black feet 8x8 composite block (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: Controlled by actions, moved 8 pixels North in the last step.
  - Goal / Lock: Yellow background, Purple symbol 8x8 square block (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Located at visible end of path (4,2). Symbol matches the collected Key icon. Player is now adjacent to it.
  - Inventory Icon: Purple symbol on Black stand Small icon in bottom-left UI (Role hypothesis: ui_element)
      Evidence: Appeared after collecting the debris/key. Persists across frames.
  - Move Counter: Red/Grey dots Row of small squares at top UI (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)
      Evidence: Updates (decrements) with every successful move action.
  - Hole / Void: Bright Green Vertical Rectangle (8x16 pixels) (Role hypothesis: obstacle)
      Evidence: Internal area of the background color within the room layout.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Will moving UP into the Goal tile trigger a standard level completion or require a specific 'Use' command?
  - Does the Goal tile consume the Key from the inventory?
  - What do the orange squares in the top right UI represent?

Legacy Objects:
  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Debris (Row 4, Col 4): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Bottom UI Element: Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - Moving into Debris clears it from the map.
  - Clearing Debris triggers a state change in the Bottom-Left UI (likely counting keys or score).
  - The path to the Goal (Row 2, Col 4) is now clear.
  - Confirmed Grid (4,3) is valid walkable floor.
  - Observations confirm that ACTION1 functions as a standard 'Move Up' in empty space, in addition to its object-interaction properties observed previously.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action

Provide your structured suggestion.
