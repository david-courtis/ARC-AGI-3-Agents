The target position at x:5 (pixel column 40) was valid walkable floor.\n      Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move RIGHT'. The Player Character (Purple block with Cyan top) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the right. The move counter in the top UI decreased by one unit.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The player spawned in Stage 2 at grid (3,5). The local map geometry at this start point is a vertical 'dead end' corridor with walls to the Left, Right, and Down. The only open path is Up (North). Attempts to move Right into the wall fail silently.\n      Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move RIGHT' (Action 4). However, the action resulted in NO CHANGE to the environment. The player character remained at grid position (3, 5) (pixels x:24, y:40).\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n\u26a0\ufe0f NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 1 (Bright Green)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 1 (Bright Green))\n  Description: The entire play area is carved out of a solid Bright Green void. Any tile not Muted Green is a wall.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Winding 'S' or Spiral shape. Start (3,5) -> Up -> Right -> Up -> Left (through Red Block (1,1)) -> Down -> Goal (1,5). Central area (2,2) is void.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A 2D grid-based puzzle game focused on resource-limited navigation. The player must traverse a maze-like floor, collect essential items (Keys) to bypass obstacles (Red Blocks), and reach a specific Goal tile. Movement is quantized and constrained by walls and void spaces.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.\n  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.\n  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.\n  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.\n  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.\n  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.\n  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).\n  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).\n  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.\n  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).\n  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.\n  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.\n  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.\n  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.\n  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.\n  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.\n  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.\n  - Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).\n  - Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.\n  - Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.\n  - Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.\n  - LEVEL TRANSITION CONFIRMED: Successfully completing the objective in Stage 1 loaded a new map (Stage 2) and reset the player position and UI move counter.\n  - NEW OBJECT: 'Red Block' (Color 15) identified at Grid (2,2). Its function (Wall/Hazard/Switch) is currently unknown but it marks a distinct path feature.\n  - PATH PUZZLE IDENTIFIED: Direct path to goal (Left) is blocked by void. The valid path requires a winding route (Right->Up->Left->Down) to collect the Key and reach the Goal.\n  - PERSISTENCE: The 'Key' mechanic is consistent; a new Key object exists in this level, matching the Goal's lock symbol.\n  - CONFIRMED WALL COLLISION: Attempting to move Right from (3,5) into Wall (4,5) had no effect and consumed no resources.\n  - MAP TOPOLOGY REVEALED: The path is a spiral. Start -> Key -> Red Block -> Goal.\n  - CRITICAL CHOKE POINT: The Red Block at (1,1) separates the Start/Key zone from the Goal zone. It must be an interactable Door/Gate.\n  - Corrected Player Position coordinates to (3,5) based on wall collision evidence.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The interaction properties of the Red Block at (1,1).\n  - The pink/grey dashed line at the very bottom (Row 7) - likely a progress or score bar.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.\n  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).\n  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.\n  - Player movement is locked to 8-pixel grid steps.\n  - Movement consumes 'Move Counter' resources.\n  - Player confined to Muted Green (Color 3) regions.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas (walls/holes).\n  - Movement is quantized to 8 pixels per action.\n  - Movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter resource.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Debris at (4,4) likely blocks direct Northward movement from (4,5).\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas.\n  - Movement consumes 1 Top-UI resource.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel steps.\n  - Movement is quantized effectively to the 8x8 grid.\n  - Successful movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) background voids.\n  - Movement is constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Must navigate around the central void to reach the Goal.\n  - Movement resets/consumes the visual Move Counter dots at the top left.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green path.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green walls.\n  - Failed moves (blocked by wall) do NOT consume Move Counter resources.\n  - Red Block (1,1) likely blocks movement until condition met (e.g., collecting key).\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2\n  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)\n  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area\n  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)\n  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid\n  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)\n  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3\n  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle\n  - Rectangular Void (Hole) at Grid Column 2, spanning Rows 2 and 3\n  - Debris Object at Grid (4,4) likely acts as an obstacle or interactable block\n  - Rectangular Hole/Void (Bright Green) at Grid Column 2, Rows 2-3\n  - The play area boundaries define a specific room shape (approx 6x5 walkable area)\n  - Bright Green void separating the Start (Col 4) and Goal (Col 2) columns\n  - Central void creating a winding 'S' or 'U' shaped corridor\n  - Central Void (Bright Green) roughly occupying columns 2-3 in the middle rows, creating a u-shaped or spiral layout.\n  - Wall at (4,5) - Confirmed by blocked movement this turn.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Player: Purple/Cyan (Composite) 8x8 Block (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: Controlled by actions, camera follows it, failure to move confirms position.\n  - Goal: Yellow/Purple Square with Keyhole (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Located at end of path (1,5); distinct visual marking matching key symbol.\n  - Key / Debris: Purple/Black Irregular/Small (Role hypothesis: collectible_key)\n      Evidence: Located at (4,3) on the path; matches shape of key collected in previous stage.\n  - Red Block: Color 15 (Dark Red) 8x8 Square (Role hypothesis: obstacle_gate)\n      Evidence: Located at (1,1), a critical choke point connecting the right path section to the left path section. Likely needs to be opened or destroyed.\n  - Move Counter: Red/Grey Row of dots (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)\n      Evidence: Updates with successful moves (previous stage evidence).\n  - Inventory Indicator (UI): Purple/Black Icon (Role hypothesis: ui_indicator)\n      Evidence: Located at bottom left (0,6) in UI area, static representation of key shape.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Does the Red Block open automatically upon collecting the Key, or is it a 'push' block?\n  - Does the bottom-left UI icon indicate 'Key Held' or 'Key Needed'?\n  - Does the score (1/254) imply a persistent campaign across levels?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Debris (Row 4, Col 4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Bottom UI Element: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Goal/Lock: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Key (Inventory): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Player Character (Color 12/Purple Block): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Wall (Bright Green): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Floor (Muted Green): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - New Object Type: Red Block (Color 15) appeared at grid (2,2) (pixels 16,16).

If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects\n3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context\n4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)\n5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect\n6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.\n7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.\n\nAnalyze what happened and provide your structured analysis."
