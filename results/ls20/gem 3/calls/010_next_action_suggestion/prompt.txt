=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

=== STAGE/LEVEL INFO ===
Current Stage: 1 (score: 0/254)
Actions in this stage: 4

ACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):
  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)
  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)
  ACTION3: Move LEFT (decrease column/x)
  ACTION4: Move RIGHT (increase column/x)

⚠️ NOTE: Only 4 actions are available in this game: ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player object (8x8 purple block with cyan top) UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels), provided the target space is empty (floor color 3).
  ACTION2: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the RIGHT (Positive X direction). Requires open floor (Color 3) in the target space.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Muted Green (Color 3)

BORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 0/1))
  Description: Solid contiguous block of Bright Green surrounding the playable Muted Green area, acting as a void/wall.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Strict 8x8 pixel grid. Playable area is an irregular room of Muted Green floor tiles surrounded by Bright Green walls. Grid coordinates (0,0) top-left to (7,7) bottom-right align with 64x64 resolution.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A grid-based puzzle or navigation game (Sokoban or similar style). The player controls a block character to reach a specific target (Yellow Face) or collect items, navigating around walls and voids within a limited number of moves (indicated by the UI counter).

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.
  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.
  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).
  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.
  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.
  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.
  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.
  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The dashed line at the bottom of the screen (UI separator?)
  - The behavior of the Debris object upon interaction
  - The behavior of the 'Hole' obstacle

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).
  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.
  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.
  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.
  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).
  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2
  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)
  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Player Character: Purple body with Cyan top strip 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: Moves in response to ACTION commands; position updates by 8 pixels (1 grid unit).
  - Goal/NPC: Yellow with Black/Purple face pattern 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Distinctive unique appearance with a 'face', located centrally in the puzzle area. Often signifies a target.
  - Small Debris: Purple and Black Small irregular 'heart' or 'V' shape (approx 4x4 pixels centered in 8x8 tile) (Role hypothesis: collectible_or_obstacle)
      Evidence: Occupies a specific grid tile (approx x:4, y:3). Distinct from floor and walls. Player moved away from its vicinity.
  - Move Counter: Red/Grey/Green sequence Row of small squares (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)
      Evidence: Located in Top UI. Analysis indicates it changes/decrements with moves, suggesting a limited number of steps.
  - Lives/Status: Orange Three squares in top right (Role hypothesis: lives_indicator)
      Evidence: Static count of 3, typical for lives in retro games.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What happens if the player touches the Debris? Is it collected or does it block?
  - What is the function of the 'L' shape in the bottom left corner?
  - Does the 'Hole' cause death/reset if stepped into, or is it just a solid wall?

Legacy Objects:
  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - Confirmed ACTION3 is 'Move Left'.
  - Reconfirmed 'Muted Green' (Color 3) is valid walkable terrain.
  - Movement is quantized to 8x8 pixel blocks.
  - Reconfirmed that movement is grid-aligned (8x8 pixels per step).
  - Confirmed valid horizontal movement range extends to at least grid column 5 (pixel x=40).

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action

Provide your structured suggestion.
