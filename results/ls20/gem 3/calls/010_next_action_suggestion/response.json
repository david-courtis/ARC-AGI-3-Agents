  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "Highest priority is to test the unobserved ACTION2 (Down). However, visual assessment shows the player positioned directly against the bottom wall (Bright Green boundary), meaning a 'Move Down' action would likely have no visible effect. To verify ACTION2 properly, we first need to move away from the bottom wall. ACTION1 (Up) is the most logical choice as the space above is open. This will also provide a needed confirmation sample for ACTION1.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify ACTION1 functions as 'Move Up' (increasing consistency count) and reach a board state (y-1) where the space below the player is open, enabling a valid test of ACTION2 in the next step.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Player is effectively cornered in the bottom-right of the current room section. South and East paths are blocked by Bright Green walls. North and West paths are open Muted Green floor."
