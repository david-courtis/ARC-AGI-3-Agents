  "reasoning": "The recent attempt to use ACTION4 (Move Right) failed because the player was blocked by a wall at (3,5). To test ACTION4 effectively, we must reposition to a coordinate where movement to the right is possible. Based on the environment analysis, the path extends slightly UP before turning RIGHT. Additionally, the 'Debris/Key' object is hypothesized to be at (4,4). Moving UP once (ACTION1) places the player at (3,4), directly adjacent to the hypothesized key location. Testing ACTION4 from this position serves to 1) Verify the 'Move Right' mechanic (currently 2/3 verified), 2) Test interaction with the Debris object, and 3) Progress toward the goal.",
  "expected_information_gain": "This test aims to confirm that ACTION4 successfully moves the player RIGHT when space permits. We expect to move from (3,4) into (4,4). If (4,4) contains the Debris/Key, we expect to see an item collection event (Key removed, Inventory updated) or a collision if it is an obstacle. This will complete the verification of ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Stage 2. Player is at (3,5) in a vertical corridor. Walls block East, West, and South. The path North is open. A Red Block is at (1,1). A Goal is at (1,5). A Key/Debris is likely at (4,4). The immediate goal is to navigate UP and then RIGHT to collect the Key."
