    "content": "You are an environment analyst studying an unknown game world.\n\nYour SOLE FOCUS is understanding the ENVIRONMENT - not the actions.\n\nCRITICAL: YOUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG!\n- Previous object identifications and role hypotheses are TENTATIVE and may need correction\n- If action results contradict your current understanding, UPDATE IT\n- You can and SHOULD replace incorrect objects/roles with better interpretations\n- Every analysis is an opportunity to REFINE or CORRECT the environment model\n\nYou must discover and document:\n1. BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking change?\n- What color/pattern indicates a boundary vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

The target tile (Row 4, Column 4) c\nEvidence Status: STATE CHANGE OBSERVED - Use this as evidence!\n\nRECENT CHANGES OBSERVED (THIS IS EVIDENCE!):\nTotal: 147 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), lower_left_playarea (9), bottom_ui (9), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-62], cols [1-39]\n\nObject-level changes: DISAPPEARED: 1 objects\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32)\nMOVED: 2 objects\n  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved up\n  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) moved up\n\n\n=== ACTION ANALYSIS INSIGHTS (from previous LLM analysis of this action) ===\nFull Interpretation: The Player Character moved UP (North) by 1 grid unit (8 pixels). The target tile (Row 4, Column 4) contained a Debris object. The Player successfully entered the tile, and the Debris object was removed (destroyed or collected) from the play area. The move consumed 1 Move Counter resource (top UI) and triggered a change in the Bottom UI (likely an inventory or score update).\nWhy This Outcome: The player was positioned at (Col 4, Row 5) facing UP. The adjacent tile at (Col 4, Row 4) contained a Debris object. The game logic defines Debris as 'breakable' or 'collectible' rather than solid, allowing the player to move into its space and clear it.\nUpdated Action Definition: Moves the player object (8x8 purple block with cyan top) UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels). Valid target tiles include empty floor (Color 3) AND tiles containing Debris (Color 9/Black). If the player moves into a Debris tile, the Debris object is removed from the grid (clearing the path) and a UI state update occurs.\nEnvironment Updates Discovered:\n  - Debris objects are NOT solid walls; they are destructible/collectible obstacles.\n  - Moving into Debris clears it from the map.\n  - Clearing Debris triggers a state change in the Bottom-Left UI (likely counting keys or score).\n  - The path to the Goal (Row 2, Col 4) is now clear.\nObjects Involved: Player Character, Debris (Row 4, Col 4), Top UI Move Counter, Bottom UI Element\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above insights were discovered by analyzing the action's effect.\nUse these insights to UPDATE your environment understanding!\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING (MAY BE WRONG - UPDATE IF NEEDED):\nBackground: Bright Green (Color 1)\nBorder: Yes (Bright Green (Color 1)) - The play area is a 'room' of Muted Green floor tiles sculpted out of a solid Bright Green background. This background acts as a wall/void.\nInternal walls/obstacles:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2\n  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)\n  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area\n  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)\n  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid\n  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)\n  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3\n  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle\n  - Rectangular Void (Hole) at Grid Column 2, spanning Rows 2 and 3\n  - Debris Object at Grid (4,4) likely acts as an obstacle or interactable block\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.\n  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).\n  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.\n  - Player movement is locked to 8-pixel grid steps.\n  - Movement consumes 'Move Counter' resources.\n  - Player confined to Muted Green (Color 3) regions.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas (walls/holes).\n  - Movement is quantized to 8 pixels per action.\n  - Movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter resource.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Debris at (4,4) likely blocks direct Northward movement from (4,5).\nIdentified objects:\n  - Player Character: Purple body with Cyan top 8x8 Square Block (Role: player)\n  - Goal: Yellow background with Black/Purple symbol 8x8 Square Block (Role: goal)\n  - Debris: Purple and Black 8x8 Irregular/Small (Role: obstacle)\n  - Hole: Bright Green (Same as Background) 8x16 Vertical Rectangle (2 tiles high) (Role: hazard)\n  - Move Counter: Grey/Red/Blue/Orange Linear array of dots/squares (Role: resource_limit)\nSpatial structure: 8x8 Pixel Grid. The room consists of Muted Green floor tiles surrounded by Bright Green void. Current Layout: Hole@(Col 2, Rows 2-3), Goal@(Col 4, Row 2), Debris@(Col 4, Row 4), Player@(Col 4, Row 5).\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n- identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n- Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n- Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.\n- Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.\n- Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.\n- Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.\n- Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.\n- Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.\n- CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).\n- Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.\n- Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).\n- Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).\n- Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).\n- Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.\n- Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).\n- Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.\n- Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.\n- Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- Is the Debris at (4,4) a static wall or a pushable block (Sokoban mechanic)?\n- Does the Hole at Col 2 cause instant failure (death) or just act as a wall?\n- What happens when the Move Counter runs out?\n- Can the player enter the Hole tile?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"Moves the player object (8x8 purple block with cyan top) UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels). Valid target tiles include empty floor (Color 3) AND tiles containing Debris (Color 9/Black). If the player moves into a Debris tile, the Debris object is removed from the grid (clearing the path) and a UI state update occurs.\"\n  ACTION2: \"Move the player character DOWN by 8 pixels (1 grid unit). Consumes 1 move resource.\"\n  ACTION3: \"Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.\"\n  ACTION4: \"Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the RIGHT (Positive X direction). Requires open floor (Color 3) in the target space.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n7. UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS: Which colors or sections of the grid have NOT been thoroughly analyzed yet? List specific colors or regions that need more investigation.\n8. DOMAIN DESCRIPTION: Provide a high-level conceptual description of the game. What type of game is this (puzzle, navigation, sokoban-like, etc.)? What appears to be the goal? How do the mechanics work together at a conceptual level?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
