  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 is currently '2/3 consistent' and needs one more successful observation to be fully VERIFIED. Since the player successfully moved RIGHT (ACTION4) in step 9 to reach the current position, the tile immediately to the LEFT is known to be open floor (backtracking). Testing ACTION3 here is safe, high-probability for success, and will complete the knowledge base for the basic movement actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Confirm that ACTION3 moves the player 8 pixels to the Left. This will provide the 3rd consistent data point required to mark the action as VERIFIED.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player is positioned at the bottom of the central corridor (approx Grid 4,6), directly South of the Key (Grid 4,4). The most recent valid move was RIGHT (Action 4), so the path to the Left is clear. Movement DOWN (Action 2) was confirmed blocked by a wall in the previous turn."
