  "reasoning": "The player is currently positioned at grid (4,5), directly below a 'Debris' object at (4,4) and the Goal at (4,2). Testing ACTION1 (Move UP) here is the highest value experiment available. It will determine if the game implements a 'Sokoban' (push block) mechanic—which is highly probable given the alignment—or if the debris is a solid obstacle. This tests interaction physics rather than just movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We will learn if the Debris object is pushable or solid. If pushable, we expect the Player to move to (4,4) and the Debris to (4,3). If solid, we expect no change, confirming 'Wall' properties for the debris.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Player at (4,5). Debris obstacle directly North at (4,4). Goal is further North at (4,2). The layout strongly suggests the debris must be manipulated (pushed) or circumvented to reach the goal."
