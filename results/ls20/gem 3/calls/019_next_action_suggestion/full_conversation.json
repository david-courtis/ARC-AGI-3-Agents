Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state!

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Bright Green (Color 1)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 1))\n  Description: The play area is a 'room' of Muted Green floor tiles sculpted out of a solid Bright Green background. This background acts as a wall/void.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  8x8 Pixel Grid. The room consists of Muted Green floor tiles surrounded by Bright Green void. Current Layout: Hole@(Col 2, Rows 2-3), Goal@(Col 4, Row 2), Debris@(Col 4, Row 4), Player@(Col 4, Row 5).\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A 2D grid-based puzzle game where the player navigates a room to reach a Goal tile. The path is obstructed by static voids (Holes) and objects (Debris). The player has limited moves (indicated by the UI counter). The alignment of Player, Debris, and Goal suggests a 'Sokoban' (push block) or 'Maze' (navigate around) mechanic.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.\n  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.\n  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.\n  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.\n  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.\n  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.\n  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).\n  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).\n  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.\n  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).\n  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.\n  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.\n  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - Interaction with the Debris at (4,4)\n  - The properties of the Hole tiles\n  - The specific function of the Orange vs Red dots in the UI\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.\n  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).\n  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.\n  - Player movement is locked to 8-pixel grid steps.\n  - Movement consumes 'Move Counter' resources.\n  - Player confined to Muted Green (Color 3) regions.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas (walls/holes).\n  - Movement is quantized to 8 pixels per action.\n  - Movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter resource.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Debris at (4,4) likely blocks direct Northward movement from (4,5).\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2\n  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)\n  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area\n  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)\n  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid\n  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)\n  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3\n  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle\n  - Rectangular Void (Hole) at Grid Column 2, spanning Rows 2 and 3\n  - Debris Object at Grid (4,4) likely acts as an obstacle or interactable block\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Player Character: Purple body with Cyan top 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: Controlled by actions; moves across grid; 128 pixel change correlates precisely with its movement.\n  - Goal: Yellow background with Black/Purple symbol 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Distinctive visual design; located in a hard-to-reach spot; typical for puzzle games.\n  - Debris: Purple and Black 8x8 Irregular/Small (Role hypothesis: obstacle)\n      Evidence: Located at Grid (4,4), directly blocking the straight path between Player (4,5) and Goal (4,2). Static during player movement.\n  - Hole: Bright Green (Same as Background) 8x16 Vertical Rectangle (2 tiles high) (Role hypothesis: hazard)\n      Evidence: Discontinuity in the Muted Green floor; visually represents a void or pit.\n  - Move Counter: Grey/Red/Blue/Orange Linear array of dots/squares (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)\n      Evidence: Located in top UI; one pixel changed exactly when Player completed a move action.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Is the Debris at (4,4) a static wall or a pushable block (Sokoban mechanic)?\n  - Does the Hole at Col 2 cause instant failure (death) or just act as a wall?\n  - What happens when the Move Counter runs out?\n  - Can the player enter the Hole tile?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Verified movement affects exactly 128 pixels in the play area (swapping one 8x8 tile for another) plus 1 pixel in the UI.\n  - Confirmed ACTION2 is 'Move Down'\n  - Verified Grid (5,5) is safe, walkable Muted Green floor\n  - Player position updated to Grid (4,5) (pixel coords x:32, y:40)\n  - Confirmed Grid (4,5) is valid walkable floor\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
