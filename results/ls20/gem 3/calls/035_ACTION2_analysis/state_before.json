      "Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.",
      "Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.",
      "Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.",
      "Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.",
      "CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).",
      "Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.",
      "Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).",
      "Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).",
      "Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).",

      "Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).",
      "Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.",
      "Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.",
      "Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.",
      "CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.",
      "Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.",
      "The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.",
      "Player path to goal is now unobstructed.",
      "Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).",
      "Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.",
      "Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.",
      "Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.",
      "LEVEL TRANSITION CONFIRMED: Successfully completing the objective in Stage 1 loaded a new map (Stage 2) and reset the player position and UI move counter.",
      "NEW OBJECT: 'Red Block' (Color 15) identified at Grid (2,2). Its function (Wall/Hazard/Switch) is currently unknown but it marks a distinct path feature.",
      "PATH PUZZLE IDENTIFIED: Direct path to goal (Left) is blocked by void. The valid path requires a winding route (Right->Up->Left->Down) to collect the Key and reach the Goal.",

      "MAP TOPOLOGY REVEALED: The path is a spiral. Start -> Key -> Red Block -> Goal.",
      "CRITICAL CHOKE POINT: The Red Block at (1,1) separates the Start/Key zone from the Goal zone. It must be an interactable Door/Gate.",
      "Corrected Player Position coordinates to (3,5) based on wall collision evidence.",
      "Confirmed Barrier at Grid (4,5): Despite appearing as reachable floor, the physics prevented movement East, implying an invisible barrier or specific path constraint encouraging Upward movement.",
      "Identified Map 'Quest' Flow: The layout forces the player away from the Goal initially (Up/Right towards Key) before looping back to the Gate (Top Left) and finally the Goal (Bottom Left).",
