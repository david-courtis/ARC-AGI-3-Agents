1. CONFIRMED WALL COLLISION: Attempting to move Right from (3,5) into Wall (4,5) had no effect and consumed no resources.
2. MAP TOPOLOGY REVEALED: The path is a spiral. Start -> Key -> Red Block -> Goal.
3. CRITICAL CHOKE POINT: The Red Block at (1,1) separates the Start/Key zone from the Goal zone. It must be an interactable Door/Gate.
4. Corrected Player Position coordinates to (3,5) based on wall collision evidence.
