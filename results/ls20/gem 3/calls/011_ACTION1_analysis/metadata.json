  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:\n\"Moves the player object (8x8 purple block with cyan top) UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels), provided the target space is empty (floor color 3).\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT\n      Context: The Player Block was positioned at row 48. The area above it (rows 40-47) consisted of open floor tiles (color 3).\n      Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move UP'. The large purple block with a cyan top (located at the bottom-right of the play area) moved upwards by 8 pixels (1 grid unit). A smaller face-like object at the top of the screeen did not move, suggesting the player controls the block.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Muted Green (Color 3)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 0/1))\n  Description: Solid contiguous block of Bright Green surrounding the playable Muted Green area, acting as a void/wall.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Strict 8x8 pixel grid. Playable area is an irregular room of Muted Green floor tiles surrounded by Bright Green walls. Grid coordinates (0,0) top-left to (7,7) bottom-right align with 64x64 resolution.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A grid-based puzzle or navigation game (Sokoban or similar style). The player controls a block character to reach a specific target (Yellow Face) or collect items, navigating around walls and voids within a limited number of moves (indicated by the UI counter).\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.\n  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.\n  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.\n  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.\n  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The dashed line at the bottom of the screen (UI separator?)\n  - The behavior of the Debris object upon interaction\n  - The behavior of the 'Hole' obstacle\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.\n  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).\n  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2\n  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)\n  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Player Character: Purple body with Cyan top strip 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: Moves in response to ACTION commands; position updates by 8 pixels (1 grid unit).\n  - Goal/NPC: Yellow with Black/Purple face pattern 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Distinctive unique appearance with a 'face', located centrally in the puzzle area. Often signifies a target.\n  - Small Debris: Purple and Black Small irregular 'heart' or 'V' shape (approx 4x4 pixels centered in 8x8 tile) (Role hypothesis: collectible_or_obstacle)\n      Evidence: Occupies a specific grid tile (approx x:4, y:3). Distinct from floor and walls. Player moved away from its vicinity.\n  - Move Counter: Red/Grey/Green sequence Row of small squares (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)\n      Evidence: Located in Top UI. Analysis indicates it changes/decrements with moves, suggesting a limited number of steps.\n  - Lives/Status: Orange Three squares in top right (Role hypothesis: lives_indicator)\n      Evidence: Static count of 3, typical for lives in retro games.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What happens if the player touches the Debris? Is it collected or does it block?\n  - What is the function of the 'L' shape in the bottom left corner?\n  - Does the 'Hole' cause death/reset if stepped into, or is it just a solid wall?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 is 'Move Left'.\n  - Reconfirmed 'Muted Green' (Color 3) is valid walkable terrain.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8x8 pixel blocks.\n  - Reconfirmed that movement is grid-aligned (8x8 pixels per step).\n  - Confirmed valid horizontal movement range extends to at least grid column 5 (pixel x=40).\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed.

IMAGE 1: The frame BEFORE the action\n2. IMAGE 2: The frame AFTER the action (final state)\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!\n2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects\n3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context\n4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)\n5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect\n6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.\n7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.\n\nAnalyze what happened and provide your structured analysis."
