  "reasoning": "Action 2 (Down) and Action 3 (Left) both require verification (currently 2/3 confirmed). Testing Action 2 directly at the current position (bottom boundary) would yield 'No Effect'. By using a setup sequence of Action 1 (Move Up, Verified), we attempt to move to Grid (4,5) closer to the Key. If successful, the subsequent Action 2 (Move Down) should return the player to the current tile, definitively verifying the 'Move Down' mechanic. This strategy also effectively probes the validity of the path North towards the Key, resolving the ambiguity about whether Grid (4,5) is a wall or floor.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to learn: 1) Whether the tile to the North (4,5) is accessible floor or a wall (resolving previous collision data), and 2) If successful, finalize verification of Action 2 as 'Move Down' by confirming it reverses the Upward movement.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Player is at the bottom of the right-hand vertical corridor (approx Grid 4,6), having clear floor to the Left (3,6) and potentially to the North (4,5). The wall is to the Right and Below. The immediate goal is to navigate North to the Key."
