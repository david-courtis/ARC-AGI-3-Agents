=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 1 (Bright Green)

BORDER: Yes (Color 1 (Bright Green))
  Description: The play area is surrounded by a solid Bright Green void. This color acts as a universal 'wall' that blocks movement.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Winding Room Layout: Player starts at bottom-right-center (4,6). Goal is at bottom-left (2,6). A void separates them, forcing a path: Right -> Up -> Left -> Down. The path contains a Key (mid-path) and a Red Block (top-left corner).

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A grid-based puzzle game where the player navigates a maze-like room to collect a specific 'Key' item and then reach a 'Goal' tile to unlock the next level. Movement is quantized (8x8 grid) and uses a limited 'Move Counter' resource (time/steps). Areas outside the floor are voids (walls).

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.
  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.
  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).
  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.
  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.
  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.
  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.
  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.
  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).
  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.
  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).
  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).
  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).
  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.
  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).
  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.
  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.
  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.
  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.
  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.
  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.
  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.
  - Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).
  - Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.
  - Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.
  - Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.
  - LEVEL TRANSITION CONFIRMED: Successfully completing the objective in Stage 1 loaded a new map (Stage 2) and reset the player position and UI move counter.
  - NEW OBJECT: 'Red Block' (Color 15) identified at Grid (2,2). Its function (Wall/Hazard/Switch) is currently unknown but it marks a distinct path feature.
  - PATH PUZZLE IDENTIFIED: Direct path to goal (Left) is blocked by void. The valid path requires a winding route (Right->Up->Left->Down) to collect the Key and reach the Goal.
  - PERSISTENCE: The 'Key' mechanic is consistent; a new Key object exists in this level, matching the Goal's lock symbol.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The specific interaction properties of the Red Block (Color 15).
  - The exact trigger area of the UI orange squares.

  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area
  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)
  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid
  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)
  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3
  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle
  - Rectangular Void (Hole) at Grid Column 2, spanning Rows 2 and 3
  - Debris Object at Grid (4,4) likely acts as an obstacle or interactable block
  - Rectangular Hole/Void (Bright Green) at Grid Column 2, Rows 2-3
  - The play area boundaries define a specific room shape (approx 6x5 walkable area)
  - Bright Green void separating the Start (Col 4) and Goal (Col 2) columns
  - Central void creating a winding 'S' or 'U' shaped corridor

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Player: Purple/Cyan 8x8 Composite Block (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: Controlled by actions; persists across levels; focus of camera/interaction.
  - Goal: Yellow/Black/Purple 8x8 Square with keyhole symbol (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Identical to previous stage's goal which triggered level completion upon contact with Key.
  - Key / Debris: Purple/Black Small irregular shape (Role hypothesis: collectible_key)
      Evidence: Matches the object collected in Stage 1 that allowed Goal interaction. Located at the midpoint of the room's path.
  - Red Block: Color 15 (Dark Red/Brown) Approx 8x8 Square (Role hypothesis: hazard_or_obstacle)
      Evidence: New object appearing in Stage 2. Distinct warning color. Located at a corner of the path (Grid 2,2).
  - Move Counter: Red/Grey Row of dots (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)
      Evidence: Refilled/Reset upon entering Stage 2. Decrements with moves.
  - Level Indicator / Score: Orange (Color 9) 3 small squares (Role hypothesis: ui_indicator)
      Evidence: Appears in top-right UI area, distinct from playfield objects.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What is the function of the Red Block? Is it a hazard (death on contact) or just a wall?
  - Did the player keep the key from the previous level (indicated by UI) or is that UI showing 'Key Needed'?
  - What do the 3 Orange squares in the top right UI represent? (Lives? Level count?)

Legacy Objects:
  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Debris (Row 4, Col 4): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Bottom UI Element: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Goal/Lock: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Key (Inventory): Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - Player position reset to (4,6) (pixels 32,48) in the new room.
  - New Goal identified at grid (2,6) (pixels 16,48).
  - New Collectible/Debris identified at grid (4,4) (pixels 32,32).
  - New Object Type: Red Block (Color 15) appeared at grid (2,2) (pixels 16,16). Function unknown (likely hazard or switch).
  - New Path Structure: Winding path connecting Player -> Debris -> Red Block -> Goal.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action

Provide your structured suggestion.
