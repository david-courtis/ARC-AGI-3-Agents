  "reasoning": "We have just entered Stage 2. The visual layout shows the player at the bottom-center with walls immediately to the North (Up), West (Left), and South (Down). The only open floor tile adjacent to the player is to the East (Right). Since ACTION4 is tentatively identified as 'Move RIGHT', attempting it here is the most logical step. It allows us to verify the action in the new stage on a valid path and avoids immediate collisions with walls that would result from other actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify if ACTION4 correctly moves the player 8 pixels to the RIGHT. This will contribute to the consistency count for ACTION4 and position the player for further exploration of the level's path.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Start of Stage 2. Player is at approx grid (4,6). The path layout is 'U' or 'S' shaped. Immediate movement options are constrained: Up, Down, and Left are blocked by Bright Green voids. Right is open. Goal is visible at (2,6) but requires traversing the winding path to reach."
