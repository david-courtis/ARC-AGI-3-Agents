BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking change?\n- What color/pattern indicates a boundary vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

A move counter po\nEvidence Status: STATE CHANGE OBSERVED - Use this as evidence!\n\nRECENT CHANGES OBSERVED (THIS IS EVIDENCE!):\nTotal: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [4-47]\n\nObject-level changes: MOVED: 2 objects\n  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) moved left\n  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40) moved left\n\n\n=== ACTION ANALYSIS INSIGHTS (from previous LLM analysis of this action) ===\nFull Interpretation: The Player Character (Purple/Cyan block) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the LEFT. A move counter point in the top UI changed state.\nWhy This Outcome: The 8x8 area immediately to the left of the player (rows 40-47, cols 32-39) consisted of Muted Green floor tiles (Color 3), which are walkable. Since the path was unobstructed by Bright Green walls, the move executed successfully.\nUpdated Action Definition: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.\nEnvironment Updates Discovered:\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 is 'Move Left'.\n  - Reconfirmed 'Muted Green' (Color 3) is valid walkable terrain.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8x8 pixel blocks.\nObjects Involved: Player Character (Purple/Cyan block), Top UI Move Counter\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above insights were discovered by analyzing the action's effect.\nUse these insights to UPDATE your environment understanding!\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING (MAY BE WRONG - UPDATE IF NEEDED):\nBackground: Muted Green (likely Color 3)\nBorder: Yes (Bright Green (likely Color 0 or 1)) - The playable area is an irregular shape of Muted Green 'floor' surrounded by a Bright Green 'void'. The Bright Green area acts as a solid wall/boundary.\nInternal walls/obstacles:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Player Character: Purple with Cyan top stripe 8x8 square block (Role: player)\n  - Goal/NPC: Yellow with face details 8x8 square block (Role: goal)\n  - Move Counter / Timer: Red and Grey dots Horizontal line of small squares (Role: resource_counter)\n  - Status Indicator: Orange Three squares (Role: lives_indicator)\nSpatial structure: 8x8 Grid. The level consists of an irregular Muted Green room defined by Bright Green negative space.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n- identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n- Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What is the function of the large 'L' shape (Black/Purple) in the bottom left corner? Is it UI or a gameplay object?\n- Does the small purple/black debris below the Yellow Face have a collision box or is it purely decorative?\n- What happens when the player reaches the Yellow Face?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"Moves the player object (8x8 purple block with cyan top) UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels), provided the target space is empty (floor color 3).\"\n  ACTION2: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION3: \"Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.\"\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n7. UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS: Which colors or sections of the grid have NOT been thoroughly analyzed yet? List specific colors or regions that need more investigation.\n8. DOMAIN DESCRIPTION: Provide a high-level conceptual description of the game. What type of game is this (puzzle, navigation, sokoban-like, etc.)? What appears to be the goal? How do the mechanics work together at a conceptual level?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
