=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 1 (Bright Green)

BORDER: Yes (Color 1 (Bright Green))
  Description: The play area is a carved-out Muted Green floor surrounded by a solid Bright Green void/wall. The movement is strictly confined to the Muted Green area.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  8x8 Grid Layout. Spiral/S-shape map. approximate path: Player Area (Bottom Center) -> Key Area (Center/Right) -> Gate Area (Top Left) -> Goal Area (Bottom Left).

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  Top-down grid-based puzzle game (Sokoban/labyrinth style). The player must navigate a constrained path, manage a finite 'move/time' resource, collect a Key object to unlock a Gate (Red Block), and reach the Goal (Yellow). Movement is discrete (grid-based).

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.
  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.
  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).
  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.
  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.
  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.
  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.
  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.
  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).
  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.
  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).
  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).
  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).
  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.
  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).
  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.
  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.
  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.
  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.
  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.
  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.
  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.
  - Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).
  - Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.
  - Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.
  - Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.
  - LEVEL TRANSITION CONFIRMED: Successfully completing the objective in Stage 1 loaded a new map (Stage 2) and reset the player position and UI move counter.
  - NEW OBJECT: 'Red Block' (Color 15) identified at Grid (2,2). Its function (Wall/Hazard/Switch) is currently unknown but it marks a distinct path feature.
  - PATH PUZZLE IDENTIFIED: Direct path to goal (Left) is blocked by void. The valid path requires a winding route (Right->Up->Left->Down) to collect the Key and reach the Goal.
  - PERSISTENCE: The 'Key' mechanic is consistent; a new Key object exists in this level, matching the Goal's lock symbol.
  - CONFIRMED WALL COLLISION: Attempting to move Right from (3,5) into Wall (4,5) had no effect and consumed no resources.
  - MAP TOPOLOGY REVEALED: The path is a spiral. Start -> Key -> Red Block -> Goal.
  - CRITICAL CHOKE POINT: The Red Block at (1,1) separates the Start/Key zone from the Goal zone. It must be an interactable Door/Gate.
  - Corrected Player Position coordinates to (3,5) based on wall collision evidence.
  - Confirmed Barrier at Grid (4,5): Despite appearing as reachable floor, the physics prevented movement East, implying an invisible barrier or specific path constraint encouraging Upward movement.
  - Identified Map 'Quest' Flow: The layout forces the player away from the Goal initially (Up/Right towards Key) before looping back to the Gate (Top Left) and finally the Goal (Bottom Left).
  - Verified Action Failure: Blocked moves do not consume the specialized 'Move Counter' resource (dots remain consistent).
  - Object Role Persistence: Key and Goal objects utilize the same visual language as Stage 1, confirming consistent mechanics.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The specific behavior of the Red Block interaction.
  - The central void area to the right of the Player's current position.

  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid
  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)
  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3
  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle

  - The play area boundaries define a specific room shape (approx 6x5 walkable area)
  - Bright Green void separating the Start (Col 4) and Goal (Col 2) columns
  - Central void creating a winding 'S' or 'U' shaped corridor
  - Central Void (Bright Green) roughly occupying columns 2-3 in the middle rows, creating a u-shaped or spiral layout.
  - Wall at (4,5) - Confirmed by blocked movement this turn.
  - Central blocks of Bright Green creating a spiral path structure
  - Wall at Grid (4,5) - Visually floor but confirmed blocked by physics
  - Red Block at Grid (1,1) acting as a dynamic wall/gate

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Player: Purple body, Cyan top 8x8 composite block (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: Controlled by actions; moves 8 pixels; tracks position.
  - Goal: Yellow square with Purple symbol 8x8 Square with internal distinct locking shape (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Similar to Stage 1 goal; marked with specific symbol matching the Key.
  - Key: Purple with Black markings Small square/debris (Role hypothesis: collectible_key)
      Evidence: Identical appearance to Stage 1 collectible; located at (4,3) in a specific niche; UI inventory likely tracks this.
  - Red Block: Dark Red 8x8 Solid Square, Grid (1,1) (Role hypothesis: obstacle_gate)
      Evidence: Distinct color; located at a critical choke point (Start of path to Goal); likely requires Key to open.
  - Move Counter: Red/Orange dots Row of small squares (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)
      Evidence: Located in UI bar; decrements on successful moves (based on Stage 1).
  - Inventory Display: Black background, Pink bar UI Box (Bottom Left) (Role hypothesis: ui_indicator)
      Evidence: Contains shape matching the Key; distinct from play area.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Why is Grid (4,5) blocked despite looking like floor? Is it a one-way path logic or a map error?
  - Does the Red Block disappear instantly upon Key collection, or require interaction?
  - What is the maximum step limit for Stage 2 (count the dots)?

Legacy Objects:
  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Debris (Row 4, Col 4): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Bottom UI Element: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Goal/Lock: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Key (Inventory): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Color 12/Purple Block): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Wall (Bright Green): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Floor (Muted Green): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - Corrected Player Start Position for Stage 2: The player is actually at Grid X:3, Y:5 (pixels 24, 40), not (4,6) as previously estimated.
  - Map Topology: The starting area is a single-tile wide vertical corridor. The tile to the RIGHT (Grid 4,5) is a Wall.
  - Action Cost: Failed moves (blocked by walls) do not consume the Move Counter resource (Top UI did not change).
  - Confirmed that blocked moves (collisions with walls) do not consume Move Counter resources.
  - Re-verified map geometry: Position (4,5) is a solid Wall.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1, ACTION4
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION4: 2 recent no-effect attempts

AVOID EXPECTED NO-OPS: If you believe an action will cause a no-op in the current state (based on your understanding of the environment), please choose a different action or use a setup sequence to change position first.
Actions with recent no-ops:
  ACTION4: 2 consecutive no-effects (last reason: The Player Character is located at grid coordinates (3,5) (pixels x:24, y:40). T...)

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action

Provide your structured suggestion.
