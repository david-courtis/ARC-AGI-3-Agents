  "reasoning": "The action ACTION2 (Move DOWN) is currently unverified (1/3 confidence). The player appears to be at the bottom edge of the walkable area (Row 5/6), meaning a direct test of ACTION2 would likely result in a 'No Effect' collision with the boundary. To systematically and efficiently verify ACTION2, we must first create space. The setup sequence uses the verified ACTION1 (Move UP) to move the player to a coordinate where the space below is known to be clear (the tile we just occupied). We then test ACTION2 to confirm it moves the player back down, verifying the action's mechanics and consistency.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to verify that ACTION2 moves the player object 8 pixels downwards (Positive Y) and consumes 1 move resource, solidifying the 'Move Down' semantic. We will also confirm that the tile at the current position remains walkable.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Player is at approx grid (3,5), pinned by a wall/boundary to the Right (ACTION4 failed) and likely the bottom. The path forward appears to be UP (Action 1) into the open corridor. The Goal is to the Left, and a Wall is to the Right."
