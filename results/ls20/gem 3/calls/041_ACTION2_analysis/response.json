However, the target position at grid (4, 7) coincides with the bottom boundary of the play area (solid Bright Green wall). Consequently, the movement was blocked, the player remained stationary, and no 'move' resource was consumed.",

The adjacent row below (y-grid 7) consists of the solid boundary wall/void (Color 4) and UI elements. Since the Move Down action targets a wall, the game logic prevents the movement.",
