=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game analyst learning how an unknown game works.

You observe state transitions (before/after frames) and analyze what actions do.
You have NO prior knowledge of this game - base all conclusions on observed evidence only.

Your job is to:
1. Describe what happened when the action was taken
2. Build/update a definition of what this action does
3. Note any objects or environment features involved
4. Track whether the action had any visible effect

IMPORTANT - CURRENT UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG:
- The environment understanding provided is TENTATIVE and may be incorrect
- Object identifications and role hypotheses could be wrong
- If what you observe CONTRADICTS the current understanding, note this!
- Your observations help REFINE or CORRECT the environment model

IMPORTANT - UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS:
- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that count successful moves
- When an action HAS EFFECT (moves something), the move counter typically decreases
- Changes in UI elements (e.g., red dots disappearing) indicate move consumption, NOT action effects
- Focus on what happened in the PLAY AREA, not just UI changes
- Grid boundaries may result in looping interactions.
- Running out of moves (counter reaches zero) causes game failure and reset

Be precise and EVIDENCE-BASED. If you're uncertain, say so.
Mark any guesses without evidence as uncertain.

[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: The Player Block was positioned at row 48. The area above it (rows 40-47) consisted of open floor tiles (color 3).
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-55], cols [2-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved up
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved up

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move UP'. The large purple block with a cyan top (located at the bottom-right of the play area) moved upwards by 8 pixels (1 grid unit). A smaller face-like object at the top of the screeen did not move, suggesting the player controls the block.
Why this outcome: The space immediately above the block (rows 40-47) was empty floor (color 3), allowing the movement to complete successfully.
Consistent: None

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION3

Context: The player was positioned at grid coordinates (40, 40) on the Muted Green floor. The space to the left was open floor.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [4-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) moved left
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40) moved left

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The Player Character (Purple/Cyan block) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the LEFT. A move counter point in the top UI changed state.
Why this outcome: The 8x8 area immediately to the left of the player (rows 40-47, cols 32-39) consisted of Muted Green floor tiles (Color 3), which are walkable. Since the path was unobstructed by Bright Green walls, the move executed successfully.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION4

Context: The player started at grid coordinate x:4, y:5 (pixel column 32). The target position at x:5 (pixel column 40) was valid walkable floor.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [6-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved right
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) moved right

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move RIGHT'. The Player Character (Purple block with Cyan top) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the right. The move counter in the top UI decreased by one unit.
Why this outcome: The 8x8 grid space immediately to the right of the player (rows 40-47, columns 40-47) contained open Muted Green floor tiles (Color 3). Since there were no walls (Color 4) or obstacles blocking the path, the move executed successfully.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: The Player Character started at grid coordinates (5, 5). The target destination (5, 4) was empty. A Debris object exists at (4, 4), to the left of the target position.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [8-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) moved up
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40) moved up

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action caused the Player Character to move UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels). The movement was executed cleanly, consuming one 'move' resource from the UI counter.
Why this outcome: The 8x8 grid cell immediately North of the player (rows 32-39, columns 40-47) was valid, empty Muted Green floor (Color 3). The Debris object located at (4,4) was adjacent to the path but did not obstruct it.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION2

Context: The Player was at (4,5). The Debris obstacle was to the left at (4,4). The space below at (5,5) was open floor.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [10-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 40) moved down
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 40) moved down

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The Player Character moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) DOWN from grid position (4,5) to (5,5). The Move Counter in the top UI decremented.
Why this outcome: The target grid cell immediately below the player (Row 5, Col 5; pixels y:40-47, x:40-47) consisted of empty Muted Green floor tiles (Color 3), which are walkable. There were no obstacles (walls, debris, hole) in the southern path.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION3

Context: Player started at Grid (5,5). Debris obstacle was located at Grid (4,4) (North-West of start, North of destination). The destination at Grid (4,5) was empty floor. The action moved the player into column alignment with the debris and goal.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [12-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) moved left
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40) moved left

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The Player Character (Purple block with Cyan top) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the LEFT, from column 5 (pixel x:40) to column 4 (pixel x:32). The move counter in the top UI decreased by one unit.
Why this outcome: The target grid cell to the immediate left (Row 5, Col 4) contained empty Muted Green floor tiles (Color 3), unobstructed by walls or debris. Since the path was clear, the movement executed successfully.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: Player interacting directly with an obstacle (Debris) for the first time.
Changes: Total: 147 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), lower_left_playarea (9), bottom_ui (9), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-62], cols [1-39]
Objects changed: DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 9 rectangular block (2x2) at (32, 32)
MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved up
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) moved up

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The Player Character moved UP (North) by 1 grid unit (8 pixels). The target tile (Row 4, Column 4) contained a Debris object. The Player successfully entered the tile, and the Debris object was removed (destroyed or collected) from the play area. The move consumed 1 Move Counter resource (top UI) and triggered a change in the Bottom UI (likely an inventory or score update).
Why this outcome: The player was positioned at (Col 4, Row 5) facing UP. The adjacent tile at (Col 4, Row 4) contained a Debris object. The game logic defines Debris as 'breakable' or 'collectible' rather than solid, allowing the player to move into its space and clear it.
Consistent: True

Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

=== STAGE/LEVEL INFO ===
Current Stage: 1 (score: 0/254)
Actions in this stage: 9

SEMANTIC HINT: ACTION1 is expected to mean "Move UP (decrease row/y)" (but verify through observation!)

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"Move UP 8 pixels. If target tile contains a Collectible (Color 9/Purple Debris), collect it (remove from map, update inventory) and move into the space."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS FOR THIS ACTION (3 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The Player Block was positioned at row 48. The area above it (rows 40-47) consisted of open floor tiles (color 3).
      Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move UP'. The large purple block with a cyan top (located at the bottom-right of the play area) moved upwards by 8 pixels (1 grid unit). A smaller face-like object at the top of the screeen did not move, suggesting the player controls the block.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The Player Character started at grid coordinates (5, 5). The target destination (5, 4) was empty. A Debris object exists at (4, 4), to the left of the target position.
      Interpretation: The action caused the Player Character to move UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels). The movement was executed cleanly, consuming one 'move' resource from the UI counter.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: Player interacting directly with an obstacle (Debris) for the first time.
      Interpretation: The Player Character moved UP (North) by 1 grid unit (8 pixels). The target tile (Row 4, Column 4) contained a Debris object. The Player successfully entered the tile, and the Debris object was removed (destroyed or collected) from the play area. The move consumed 1 Move Counter resource (top UI) and triggered a change in the Bottom UI (likely an inventory or score update).

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Bright Green (Color 1)

BORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 1))
  Description: The play area is carved out of a solid Bright Green field. Any Bright Green area acts as a hard boundary or void.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  8x8 Pixel Grid. The map is 'Room 1'. Player is now at (4,4). Goal is at (4,2). Path to goal (4,3) is clear floor.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A grid-based puzzle game where the player must collect specific items (Keys/Fragments) to unlock or activate a Goal. Movement is limited by a step counter (Top UI). The display includes the main play area, a move counter (Top), and an inventory status area (Bottom Left).

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.
  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.
  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).
  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.
  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.
  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.
  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.
  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.
  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).
  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.
  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).
  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).
  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).
  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.
  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).
  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.
  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.
  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.
  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.
  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.
  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.
  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The exact behavior of the Goal tile interaction (win state animation?)
  - The failure state (running out of time/falling in hole)

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).
  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.
  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.
  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.
  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).
  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.
  - Player movement is locked to 8-pixel grid steps.
  - Movement consumes 'Move Counter' resources.
  - Player confined to Muted Green (Color 3) regions.
  - Player constrained to Muted Green floor tiles.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas (walls/holes).
  - Movement is quantized to 8 pixels per action.
  - Movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter resource.
  - Player constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.
  - Debris at (4,4) likely blocks direct Northward movement from (4,5).
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas.
  - Movement consumes 1 Top-UI resource.
  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel steps.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2
  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)
  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area
  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)
  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid
  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)
  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3
  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle
  - Rectangular Void (Hole) at Grid Column 2, spanning Rows 2 and 3
  - Debris Object at Grid (4,4) likely acts as an obstacle or interactable block
  - Rectangular Hole/Void (Bright Green) at Grid Column 2, Rows 2-3

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Player Character: Purple body, Cyan top 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: Moves in response to commands; central active element.
  - Goal: Yellow background, Purple/Black symbol 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Distinct visual marking (Yellow); target of the path.
  - Collectible Key/Fragment (Previously 'Debris'): Purple and Black Small irregular 8x8 sprite (Role hypothesis: collectible)
      Evidence: Object at (4,4) DISAPPEARED when player entered the tile. A matching icon simultaneously appeared/updated in the Bottom-Left UI.
  - Inventory Display: Purple/Black icon on black/green background UI Icon (Role hypothesis: ui_element)
      Evidence: Located in bottom-left corner outside play grid; updated appearance exactly when the map object was collected.
  - Hole/Void: Bright Green Vertical Rectangle (16x8 pixels) (Role hypothesis: obstacle)
      Evidence: Interrupts the Muted Green floor; matches background wall color.
  - Move Counter: Multicolor dots Linear array (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)
      Evidence: Decrements/changes with each move.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Does the player need to manually 'use' the collected item on the goal, or just walk onto it?
  - What happens if the move counter runs out?
  - Is the Hole purely a wall or does it kill the player?

Legacy Objects:
  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Debris (Row 4, Col 4): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Bottom UI Element: Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - Confirmed Grid (4,5) is valid walkable floor
  - Debris objects are NOT solid walls; they are destructible/collectible obstacles.
  - Moving into Debris clears it from the map.
  - Clearing Debris triggers a state change in the Bottom-Left UI (likely counting keys or score).
  - The path to the Goal (Row 2, Col 4) is now clear.

FRAME CHANGES (before → final state, pixel level):
Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_right_playarea (64), lower_right_playarea (64), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-39], cols [16-39]

I'm showing you 2 LABELED images:
1. IMAGE 1: The frame BEFORE the action
2. IMAGE 2: The frame AFTER the action (final state)

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!
2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects
3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context
4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)
5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect
6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.
7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.

Analyze what happened and provide your structured analysis.
