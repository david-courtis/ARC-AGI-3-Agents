=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

Current Stage: 1 (score: 0/254)
Actions in this stage: 5

ACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):
  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)
  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)
  ACTION3: Move LEFT (decrease column/x)
  ACTION4: Move RIGHT (increase column/x)

⚠️ NOTE: Only 4 actions are available in this game: ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player object (8x8 purple block with cyan top) UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels), provided the target space is empty (floor color 3).
  ACTION2: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the RIGHT (Positive X direction). Requires open floor (Color 3) in the target space.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Muted Green (Color 3)

BORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 1))
  Description: A solid, contiguous region of Bright Green surrounds the central playing floor, acting as a wall/void.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  8x8 pixel grid. Player is currently at Grid (4,5) [Row 4, Col 5]. Debris is at Grid (4,4). Goal is at Grid (2,4). The 'Hole' spans Grid (2-3, 2). Playable floor is Muted Green.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A 2D grid-based puzzle game (likely Sokoban-style or pathfinding) where the player controls a Purple/Cyan block. The goal is likely to reach the Yellow target. Mechanics involve navigating around obstacles (Hole, Debris) within a limited number of moves tracked by the top UI.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.
  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.
  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).
  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.
  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.
  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.
  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.
  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.
  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).
  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.
  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).
  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The interaction properties of the Debris object.
  - The specific consequence of running out of moves.
  - The purpose of the bottom-left L-shaped structure.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).
  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.
  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.
  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.
  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).
  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.
  - Player movement is locked to 8-pixel grid steps.
  - Movement consumes 'Move Counter' resources.
  - Player confined to Muted Green (Color 3) regions.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2
  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)
  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area
  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)
  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid
  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Player Character: Purple body with Cyan top 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: Moves in response to ACTION1; consumes move counter; previous frames showed lateral movement.
  - Goal: Yellow with Black/Purple face 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Distinct visual design implying a target; located centrally in the upper room area.
  - Debris: Purple and Black Small irregular 8x8 tile (Role hypothesis: obstacle)
      Evidence: Stationary object at Grid (4,4). Player moved adjacent to it but not through it yet.
  - Hole: Bright Green Vertical Rectangle (8x16 pixels) (Role hypothesis: hazard)
      Evidence: Matches the color of the boundary walls; visually represents a gap in the Muted Green floor.
  - Move Counter UI: Red/Green/Grey dots Horizontal line of small squares (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)
      Evidence: Top-left dots experienced a state change (1 pixel changed from active to inactive color) coincident with player movement.
  - Decorative L-Shape: Black and Purple L-shape (Role hypothesis: decoration_or_ui)
      Evidence: Located in bottom-left corner outside the apparent playable area (separated by wall).

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Is the Debris at (4,4) a solid wall or a pushable block (Sokoban mechanics)?
  - What occurs when the Move Counter (dots) is fully depleted?
  - Does the 'Hole' (Col 2) kill the player or just block movement?
  - What is the function of ACTION2 and ACTION5?

Legacy Objects:
  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - Reconfirmed that movement is grid-aligned (8x8 pixels per step).
  - Confirmed valid horizontal movement range extends to at least grid column 5 (pixel x=40).
  - Confirmed Player moves 8 pixels UP in response to ACTION1.
  - Reconfirmed Debris location at grid (4,4), adjacent to the player's new position.
  - Verified movement affects exactly 128 pixels in the play area (swapping one 8x8 tile for another) plus 1 pixel in the UI.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action

Provide your structured suggestion.
