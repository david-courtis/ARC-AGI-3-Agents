  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 is the only action identified in the game files that has not yet been observed. According to our strategy, testing unobserved actions is the highest priority. The current position at Grid (4,5) appears to have open floor space directly below it (South/Down), making this an ideal, low-risk state to verify if ACTION2 corresponds to 'Move DOWN' as hinted.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm that ACTION2 moves the player character 8 pixels (1 grid unit) downwards to Grid (5,5). This will complete our initial mapping of the four directional inputs.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player is at Grid (4,5). There is a Debris object immediately to the Left at (4,4). The Goal is to the North-West at (2,4). The area to the South (Down) appears to be clear Muted Green floor, suitable for movement testing."
