  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:\n\"Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The player was positioned at grid coordinates (40, 40) on the Muted Green floor. The space to the left was open floor.\n      Interpretation: The Player Character (Purple/Cyan block) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the LEFT. A move counter point in the top UI changed state.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Player started at Grid (5,5). Debris obstacle was located at Grid (4,4) (North-West of start, North of destination). The destination at Grid (4,5) was empty floor. The action moved the player into column alignment with the debris and goal.\n      Interpretation: The Player Character (Purple block with Cyan top) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the LEFT, from column 5 (pixel x:40) to column 4 (pixel x:32). The move counter in the top UI decreased by one unit.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 3 (Muted Green)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 1 (Bright Green))\n  Description: Solid bright green void completely enclosing the walkable area and creating internal voids.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Spiral/Backtracking Maze. Player is currently at the bottom of a dead-end central column (Grid 4,6). Path leads NORTH to a Key (Grid 4,4), then winds EAST (Right), NORTH, WEST (Top), and finally SOUTH (Left Column) past a Red Gate to the Goal.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A grid-based puzzle navigation game where the player attempts to reach a Goal tile (Yellow). The path is obstructed by walls (Bright Green void) and conditional gates (Red Blocks). The player must traverse specific paths to collect Keys (Debris) which are required to open gates or complete the level. Movement is quantized to an 8x8 grid and consumes a limited 'time' or 'step' resource.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.\n  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.\n  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.\n  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.\n  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.\n  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.\n  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).\n  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).\n  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.\n  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).\n  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.\n  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.\n  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.\n  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.\n  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.\n  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.\n  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.\n  - Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).\n  - Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.\n  - Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.\n  - Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.\n  - LEVEL TRANSITION CONFIRMED: Successfully completing the objective in Stage 1 loaded a new map (Stage 2) and reset the player position and UI move counter.\n  - NEW OBJECT: 'Red Block' (Color 15) identified at Grid (2,2). Its function (Wall/Hazard/Switch) is currently unknown but it marks a distinct path feature.\n  - PATH PUZZLE IDENTIFIED: Direct path to goal (Left) is blocked by void. The valid path requires a winding route (Right->Up->Left->Down) to collect the Key and reach the Goal.\n  - PERSISTENCE: The 'Key' mechanic is consistent; a new Key object exists in this level, matching the Goal's lock symbol.\n  - CONFIRMED WALL COLLISION: Attempting to move Right from (3,5) into Wall (4,5) had no effect and consumed no resources.\n  - MAP TOPOLOGY REVEALED: The path is a spiral. Start -> Key -> Red Block -> Goal.\n  - CRITICAL CHOKE POINT: The Red Block at (1,1) separates the Start/Key zone from the Goal zone. It must be an interactable Door/Gate.\n  - Corrected Player Position coordinates to (3,5) based on wall collision evidence.\n  - Confirmed Barrier at Grid (4,5): Despite appearing as reachable floor, the physics prevented movement East, implying an invisible barrier or specific path constraint encouraging Upward movement.\n  - Identified Map 'Quest' Flow: The layout forces the player away from the Goal initially (Up/Right towards Key) before looping back to the Gate (Top Left) and finally the Goal (Bottom Left).\n  - Verified Action Failure: Blocked moves do not consume the specialized 'Move Counter' resource (dots remain consistent).\n  - Object Role Persistence: Key and Goal objects utilize the same visual language as Stage 1, confirming consistent mechanics.\n  - PATH CONFIRMATION: The Player's start position (3,5) is effectively a dead-end in 3 directions (Left, Right, Up-backtrack). The only forward path is DOWN to (3,6) then RIGHT to (4,6).\n  - GEOMETRY REFINED: A wall exists at Grid (4,5) which forces the player to take a 'U-turn' at the bottom of the map (Down->Right) to access the vertical corridor on the right side.\n  - DEAD END CLARIFICATION: The 'Red Block' at (1,1) and 'Goal' at (1,5) are separated by a vertical void (rows 2-4 in column 1), implying a mechanic (teleport/bridge) is needed to traverse from top-left to bottom-left.\n  - CONFIRMED LAYOUT: The map is a 'Spiral' requiring collection and backtracking. Player start -> Right -> Up (Key) -> Backtrack/Right -> Loop around -> Goal.\n  - OBJECT LOCATION: Key is located at Grid (4,4), exactly 2 grid steps North of the Player's current position (4,6).\n  - PATH VERIFICATION: The path to the Right (Col 5) and Up (Col 4) is clear Muted Green floor.\n  - SCORE/RESOURCE: 'Score' increased to 1, likely tracking the number of steps taken or effective moves.\n  - CONFIRMED WALL: Action 2 failure proves a solid boundary exists at Grid (4,7), directly below the player.\n  - DEAD END: The player is currently positioned at the very bottom of the central corridor. The only valid movement direction is UP (North) towards the Key.\n  - PUZZLE TOPOLOGY: Validated 'Key-Gated Spiral' layout. The player must move UP to collect the Key, then backtrack/loop around the entire map to approach the Red Gate from the North-West to reach the Goal.\n  - STARTING STATE CLARIFICATION: Stage 2 forces an immediate collection/backtrack sequence.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The specific interaction mechanics of the Red Block (does it turn into floor or just vanish?)\n  - The far right vertical corridor (Column 6/7) traversal.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.\n  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).\n  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.\n  -

Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas (walls/holes).\n  - Movement is quantized to 8 pixels per action.\n  - Movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter resource.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Debris at (4,4) likely blocks direct Northward movement from (4,5).\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas.\n  - Movement consumes 1 Top-UI resource.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel steps.\n  - Movement is quantized effectively to the 8x8 grid.\n  - Successful movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) background voids.\n  - Movement is constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Must navigate around the central void to reach the Goal.\n  - Movement resets/consumes the visual Move Counter dots at the top left.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green path.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green walls.\n  - Failed moves (blocked by wall) do NOT consume Move Counter resources.\n  - Red Block (1,1) likely blocks movement until condition met (e.g., collecting key).\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) walls.\n  - Movement blocked to the RIGHT of current position (3,5) -> (4,5) is a barrier.\n  - Red Block at (1,1) potentially blocks movement until unlocked.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green walls/voids.\n  - Movement is grid-based (8 pixels).\n  - Previous move Right failed at (3,5), indicating (4,5) is a wall.\n  - Current position (3,6) has a clear path to the East (Right).\n  - Player bounded by Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Cannot enter Bright Green void.\n  - Movement is grid-locked to 8x8 pixels.\n  - Red Block likely acts as a solid wall until an unknown condition (Key collection) is met.\n  - Player blocked from moving SOUTH from (4,6) by boundary wall.\n  - Player bounded Left and Right by internal voids at current position.\n  - Movement restricted to Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Red Block at (1,1) acts as a conditional barrier.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2\n  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)\n  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area\n  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)\n  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid\n  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)\n  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3\n  -

Rectangular Hole/Void (Bright Green) at Grid Column 2, Rows 2-3\n  - The play area boundaries define a specific room shape (approx 6x5 walkable area)\n  - Bright Green void separating the Start (Col 4) and Goal (Col 2) columns\n  - Central void creating a winding 'S' or 'U' shaped corridor\n  - Central Void (Bright Green) roughly occupying columns 2-3 in the middle rows, creating a u-shaped or spiral layout.\n  - Wall at (4,5) - Confirmed by blocked movement this turn.\n  - Central blocks of Bright Green creating a spiral path structure\n  - Wall at Grid (4,5) - Visually floor but confirmed blocked by physics\n  - Red Block at Grid (1,1) acting as a dynamic wall/gate\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid (2,2) to (2,4)\n  - Wall/Void at grid (4,5) - Confirmed by previous collision\n  - Wall/Void at grid (2,5) - Determining the dead-end nature of the Start point\n  - Gap between Red Block (1,1) and Goal (1,5)\n  - Central Void column (Column 2) separating Start/Key area from Goal area\n  - Bright Green walls defining the 'Spiral' corridor shape\n  - Solid wall directly SOUTH of Player at Grid (4,7)\n  - Vertical void separating Column 1 (Goal/Gate) from Column 3/4 (Key/Player)\n  - Solid walls bounding the central corridor columns 3 and 5\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Player Character: Purple with Cyan top 8x8 Square (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: Controlled by actions; movement blocked by walls.\n  - Key / Fragment: Purple/Black Small debris/symbol (Role hypothesis: collectible_key)\n      Evidence: Located at Grid (4,4) on the only path out; matches symbol on Goal in previous level; marks objective.\n  - Red Block: Dark Red (Color 2) 8x8 Square (Role hypothesis: obstacle_gate)\n      Evidence: Located at Grid (1,1), blocking the path to the Goal corridor. Likely requires Key to remove.\n  - Goal: Yellow with Purple Symbol 8x8 Square (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Located at Grid (1,5); distinct visual marker matching previous level's exit.\n  - Move Counter: Red/Orange Row of dots/squares (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)\n      Evidence: Top UI element tracking actions.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Does the Red Block require a specific 'Unlock' action or does it vanish automatically upon Key collection?\n  - Is the path around the right side fully clear of invisible barriers?\n  - Does the score/step counter impose a strict failure condition?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Debris (Row 4, Col 4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Bottom UI Element: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Goal/Lock: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Key (Inventory): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Player Character (Color 12/Purple Block): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Wall (Bright Green): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Floor (Muted Green): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Player Character (Color 12/9 Block): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Floor Tile (3,6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Player Character (Color 12 top, Color 9 body): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Floor Tile at (4, 6) (Destination): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Floor Tile at (3, 6) (Origin): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Bottom Boundary Wall: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Validated Floor: The tile at Grid (3,6) is confirmed to be valid, walkable Muted Green floor.\n  - Pathfinding: The local geometry appears to be a 'U' turn or corner. Since (3,5) blocked Right and (2,5) is Wall, and (3,6) is now occupied, the likely path continues Right from (3,6).\n  - Confirmed that the wall blocking the rightward path exists only at Row 5 in this section, while Row 6 behaves as an open corridor.\n  - Verified that grid coordinates (4, 6) are walkable floor.\n  - Confirmed solid boundary wall at grid row 7 (pixels y:56-63).\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed.

The space to the left was open floor.\n      Interpretation: The Player Character (Purple/Cyan block) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the LEFT. A move counter point in the top UI changed state.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Player started at Grid (5,5). Debris obstacle was located at Grid (4,4) (North-West of start, North of destination). The destination at Grid (4,5) was empty floor. The action moved the player into column alignment with the debris and goal.\n      Interpretation: The Player Character (Purple block with Cyan top) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the LEFT, from column 5 (pixel x:40) to column 4 (pixel x:32). The move counter in the top UI decreased by one unit.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 3 (Muted Green)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 1 (Bright Green))\n  Description: Solid bright green void completely enclosing the walkable area and creating internal voids.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Spiral/Backtracking Maze. Player is currently at the bottom of a dead-end central column (Grid 4,6). Path leads NORTH to a Key (Grid 4,4), then winds EAST (Right), NORTH, WEST (Top), and finally SOUTH (Left Column) past a Red Gate to the Goal.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A grid-based puzzle navigation game where the player attempts to reach a Goal tile (Yellow). The path is obstructed by walls (Bright Green void) and conditional gates (Red Blocks). The player must traverse specific paths to collect Keys (Debris) which are required to open gates or complete the level. Movement is quantized to an 8x8 grid and consumes a limited 'time' or 'step' resource.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.\n  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.\n  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.\n  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.\n  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.\n  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.\n  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).\n  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).\n  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.\n  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).\n  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.\n  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.\n  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.\n  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.\n  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.\n  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.\n  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.\n  - Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).\n  - Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.\n  - Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.\n  - Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.\n  - LEVEL TRANSITION CONFIRMED: Successfully completing the objective in Stage 1 loaded a new map (Stage 2) and reset the player position and UI move counter.\n  - NEW OBJECT: 'Red Block' (Color 15) identified at Grid (2,2). Its function (Wall/Hazard/Switch) is currently unknown but it marks a distinct path feature.\n  - PATH PUZZLE IDENTIFIED: Direct path to goal (Left) is blocked by void. The valid path requires a winding route (Right->Up->Left->Down) to collect the Key and reach the Goal.\n  - PERSISTENCE: The 'Key' mechanic is consistent; a new Key object exists in this level, matching the Goal's lock symbol.\n  - CONFIRMED WALL COLLISION: Attempting to move Right from (3,5) into Wall (4,5) had no effect and consumed no resources.\n  - MAP TOPOLOGY REVEALED: The path is a spiral. Start -> Key -> Red Block -> Goal.\n  - CRITICAL CHOKE POINT: The Red Block at (1,1) separates the Start/Key zone from the Goal zone. It must be an interactable Door/Gate.\n  - Corrected Player Position coordinates to (3,5) based on wall collision evidence.\n  - Confirmed Barrier at Grid (4,5): Despite appearing as reachable floor, the physics prevented movement East, implying an invisible barrier or specific path constraint encouraging Upward movement.\n  - Identified Map 'Quest' Flow: The layout forces the player away from the Goal initially (Up/Right towards Key) before looping back to the Gate (Top Left) and finally the Goal (Bottom Left).\n  - Verified Action Failure: Blocked moves do not consume the specialized 'Move Counter' resource (dots remain consistent).\n  - Object Role Persistence: Key and Goal objects utilize the same visual language as Stage 1, confirming consistent mechanics.\n  - PATH CONFIRMATION: The Player's start position (3,5) is effectively a dead-end in 3 directions (Left, Right, Up-backtrack). The only forward path is DOWN to (3,6) then RIGHT to (4,6).\n  - GEOMETRY REFINED: A wall exists at Grid (4,5) which forces the player to take a 'U-turn' at the bottom of the map (Down->Right) to access the vertical corridor on the right side.\n  - DEAD END CLARIFICATION: The 'Red Block' at (1,1) and 'Goal' at (1,5) are separated by a vertical void (rows 2-4 in column 1), implying a mechanic (teleport/bridge) is needed to traverse from top-left to bottom-left.\n  - CONFIRMED LAYOUT: The map is a 'Spiral' requiring collection and backtracking. Player start -> Right -> Up (Key) -> Backtrack/Right -> Loop around -> Goal.\n  - OBJECT LOCATION: Key is located at Grid (4,4), exactly 2 grid steps North of the Player's current position (4,6).\n  - PATH VERIFICATION: The path to the Right (Col 5) and Up (Col 4) is clear Muted Green floor.\n  - SCORE/RESOURCE: 'Score' increased to 1, likely tracking the number of steps taken or effective moves.\n  - CONFIRMED WALL: Action 2 failure proves a solid boundary exists at Grid (4,7), directly below the player.\n  - DEAD END: The player is currently positioned at the very bottom of the central corridor. The only valid movement direction is UP (North) towards the Key.\n  - PUZZLE TOPOLOGY: Validated 'Key-Gated Spiral' layout. The player must move UP to collect the Key, then backtrack/loop around the entire map to approach the Red Gate from the North-West to reach the Goal.\n  - STARTING STATE CLARIFICATION: Stage 2 forces an immediate collection/backtrack sequence.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The specific interaction mechanics of the Red Block (does it turn into floor or just vanish?)\n  - The far right vertical corridor (Column 6/7) traversal.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.\n  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).\n  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.\n  -

Debris at (4,4) likely blocks direct Northward movement from (4,5).\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas.\n  - Movement consumes 1 Top-UI resource.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel steps.\n  - Movement is quantized effectively to the 8x8 grid.\n  - Successful movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) background voids.\n  - Movement is constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Must navigate around the central void to reach the Goal.\n  - Movement resets/consumes the visual Move Counter dots at the top left.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green path.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green walls.\n  - Failed moves (blocked by wall) do NOT consume Move Counter resources.\n  - Red Block (1,1) likely blocks movement until condition met (e.g., collecting key).\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) walls.\n  - Movement blocked to the RIGHT of current position (3,5) -> (4,5) is a barrier.\n  - Red Block at (1,1) potentially blocks movement until unlocked.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green walls/voids.\n  - Movement is grid-based (8 pixels).\n  - Previous move Right failed at (3,5), indicating (4,5) is a wall.\n  - Current position (3,6) has a clear path to the East (Right).\n  - Player bounded by Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Cannot enter Bright Green void.\n  - Movement is grid-locked to 8x8 pixels.\n  - Red Block likely acts as a solid wall until an unknown condition (Key collection) is met.\n  - Player blocked from moving SOUTH from (4,6) by boundary wall.\n  - Player bounded Left and Right by internal voids at current position.\n  - Movement restricted to Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Red Block at (1,1) acts as a conditional barrier.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2\n  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4\n  -

Rectangular Hole/Void (Bright Green) at Grid Column 2, Rows 2-3\n  - The play area boundaries define a specific room shape (approx 6x5 walkable area)\n  - Bright Green void separating the Start (Col 4) and Goal (Col 2) columns\n  - Central void creating a winding 'S' or 'U' shaped corridor\n  - Central Void (Bright Green) roughly occupying columns 2-3 in the middle rows, creating a u-shaped or spiral layout.\n  - Wall at (4,5) - Confirmed by blocked movement this turn.\n  - Central blocks of Bright Green creating a spiral path structure\n  - Wall at Grid (4,5) - Visually floor but confirmed blocked by physics\n  - Red Block at Grid (1,1) acting as a dynamic wall/gate\n  -

Key / Fragment: Purple/Black Small debris/symbol (Role hypothesis: collectible_key)\n      Evidence: Located at Grid (4,4) on the only path out; matches symbol on Goal in previous level; marks objective.\n  - Red Block: Dark Red (Color 2) 8x8 Square (Role hypothesis: obstacle_gate)\n      Evidence: Located at Grid (1,1), blocking the path to the Goal corridor.

IMAGE 1: The frame BEFORE the action\n2. IMAGE 2: The frame AFTER the action (final state)\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!\n2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects\n3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context\n4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)\n5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect\n6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.\n7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.\n\nAnalyze what happened and provide your structured analysis."
