  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "We must prioritize unverified actions. Hints suggest ACTION3 is 'Move LEFT'. The current board state shows open floor ('Muted Green') to the immediate left of the player character (purple block), providing a clear path to verify this specific movement without obstacle interference.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to verify that ACTION3 moves the player avatar one grid unit (8 pixels) to the left. This would provide the first confirmation for this directional input.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player is positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the accessible room. The area to the left and up is clear. The right side appears close to the wall boundary. The goal (yellow face) lies to the northwest."
