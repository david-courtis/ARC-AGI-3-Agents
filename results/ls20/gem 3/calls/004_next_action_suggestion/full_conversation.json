Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)\n2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)\n3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to\ndiscover context-dependent behaviors."

ACTION1: \u2713 EFFECT - The visible action was 'Move UP'. The large purple block wit...\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n\u26a0\ufe0f NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Muted Green (likely Color 3)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Bright Green (likely Color 0 or 1))\n  Description: The playable area is an irregular shape of Muted Green 'floor' surrounded by a Bright Green 'void'. The Bright Green area acts as a solid wall/boundary.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  8x8 Grid. The level consists of an irregular Muted Green room defined by Bright Green negative space.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  Grid-based navigation puzzle. The player controls a block avatar and must navigate a constrained room layout to reach a target (likely the yellow face). Movement is quantized to the grid and tracked by a step counter/timer at the top of the screen.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The dashed grey line at the very bottom of the screen\n  - The Black/Purple 'L' shape in the bottom-left corner\n  - The exact interaction properties of the 'Goal' object\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Player Character: Purple with Cyan top stripe 8x8 square block (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: The object moved UP by 8 pixels (1 grid unit) in response to ACTION1, while other objects remained stationary. The action analysis confirms this object moved.\n  - Goal/NPC: Yellow with face details 8x8 square block (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Distinct, unique object with face details located centrally in the room. Staying static while player moves typically indicates a goal or interaction target.\n  - Move Counter / Timer: Red and Grey dots Horizontal line of small squares (Role hypothesis: resource_counter)\n      Evidence: Located in the top UI margin. The observed state change 'top_ui (1)' coincides with the move action, suggesting a dot changed color to track the move.\n  - Status Indicator: Orange Three squares (Role hypothesis: lives_indicator)\n      Evidence: Static UI element in top right, likely tracking lives or level progress (common pattern).\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the function of the large 'L' shape (Black/Purple) in the bottom left corner? Is it UI or a gameplay object?\n  - Does the small purple/black debris below the Yellow Face have a collision box or is it purely decorative?\n  - What happens when the player reaches the Yellow Face?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 8x8 Purple/Cyan block responds to movement controls, identifying it as the likely Player Character.\n  - Movement occurs in 8-pixel steps (1 grid unit).\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
