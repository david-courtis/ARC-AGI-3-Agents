=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game analyst learning how an unknown game works.

You observe state transitions (before/after frames) and analyze what actions do.
You have NO prior knowledge of this game - base all conclusions on observed evidence only.

Your job is to:
1. Describe what happened when the action was taken
2. Build/update a definition of what this action does
3. Note any objects or environment features involved
4. Track whether the action had any visible effect

IMPORTANT - CURRENT UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG:
- The environment understanding provided is TENTATIVE and may be incorrect
- Object identifications and role hypotheses could be wrong
- If what you observe CONTRADICTS the current understanding, note this!
- Your observations help REFINE or CORRECT the environment model

IMPORTANT - UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS:
- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that count successful moves
- When an action HAS EFFECT (moves something), the move counter typically decreases
- Changes in UI elements (e.g., red dots disappearing) indicate move consumption, NOT action effects
- Focus on what happened in the PLAY AREA, not just UI changes
- Grid boundaries may result in looping interactions.
- Running out of moves (counter reaches zero) causes game failure and reset

Be precise and EVIDENCE-BASED. If you're uncertain, say so.
Mark any guesses without evidence as uncertain.

[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: The Player Block was positioned at row 48. The area above it (rows 40-47) consisted of open floor tiles (color 3).
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-55], cols [2-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved up
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved up

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move UP'. The large purple block with a cyan top (located at the bottom-right of the play area) moved upwards by 8 pixels (1 grid unit). A smaller face-like object at the top of the screeen did not move, suggesting the player controls the block.
Why this outcome: The space immediately above the block (rows 40-47) was empty floor (color 3), allowing the movement to complete successfully.
Consistent: None

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION3

Context: The player was positioned at grid coordinates (40, 40) on the Muted Green floor. The space to the left was open floor.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [4-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) moved left
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40) moved left

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The Player Character (Purple/Cyan block) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the LEFT. A move counter point in the top UI changed state.
Why this outcome: The 8x8 area immediately to the left of the player (rows 40-47, cols 32-39) consisted of Muted Green floor tiles (Color 3), which are walkable. Since the path was unobstructed by Bright Green walls, the move executed successfully.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION4

Context: The player started at grid coordinate x:4, y:5 (pixel column 32). The target position at x:5 (pixel column 40) was valid walkable floor.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [6-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved right
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) moved right

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move RIGHT'. The Player Character (Purple block with Cyan top) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the right. The move counter in the top UI decreased by one unit.
Why this outcome: The 8x8 grid space immediately to the right of the player (rows 40-47, columns 40-47) contained open Muted Green floor tiles (Color 3). Since there were no walls (Color 4) or obstacles blocking the path, the move executed successfully.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: The Player Character started at grid coordinates (5, 5). The target destination (5, 4) was empty. A Debris object exists at (4, 4), to the left of the target position.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [8-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) moved up
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40) moved up

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action caused the Player Character to move UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels). The movement was executed cleanly, consuming one 'move' resource from the UI counter.
Why this outcome: The 8x8 grid cell immediately North of the player (rows 32-39, columns 40-47) was valid, empty Muted Green floor (Color 3). The Debris object located at (4,4) was adjacent to the path but did not obstruct it.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION2

Context: The Player was at (4,5). The Debris obstacle was to the left at (4,4). The space below at (5,5) was open floor.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [10-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 40) moved down
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 40) moved down

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The Player Character moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) DOWN from grid position (4,5) to (5,5). The Move Counter in the top UI decremented.
Why this outcome: The target grid cell immediately below the player (Row 5, Col 5; pixels y:40-47, x:40-47) consisted of empty Muted Green floor tiles (Color 3), which are walkable. There were no obstacles (walls, debris, hole) in the southern path.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION3

Context: Player started at Grid (5,5). Debris obstacle was located at Grid (4,4) (North-West of start, North of destination). The destination at Grid (4,5) was empty floor. The action moved the player into column alignment with the debris and goal.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-47], cols [12-47]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40) moved left
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40) moved left

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The Player Character (Purple block with Cyan top) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the LEFT, from column 5 (pixel x:40) to column 4 (pixel x:32). The move counter in the top UI decreased by one unit.
Why this outcome: The target grid cell to the immediate left (Row 5, Col 4) contained empty Muted Green floor tiles (Color 3), unobstructed by walls or debris. Since the path was clear, the movement executed successfully.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: Player interacting directly with an obstacle (Debris) for the first time.
Changes: Total: 147 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), lower_left_playarea (9), bottom_ui (9), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-62], cols [1-39]

MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 32) moved up
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 32) moved up

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The Player Character moved UP (North) by 1 grid unit (8 pixels). The target tile (Row 4, Column 4) contained a Debris object. The Player successfully entered the tile, and the Debris object was removed (destroyed or collected) from the play area. The move consumed 1 Move Counter resource (top UI) and triggered a change in the Bottom UI (likely an inventory or score update).
Why this outcome: The player was positioned at (Col 4, Row 5) facing UP. The adjacent tile at (Col 4, Row 4) contained a Debris object. The game logic defines Debris as 'breakable' or 'collectible' rather than solid, allowing the player to move into its space and clear it.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: The player is navigating a green room. Having previously collected the item at (4,4), the path North to the Goal at (4,2) is now clear. The current move takes the player into the empty space between their previous position and the Goal.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_right_playarea (64), lower_right_playarea (64), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-39], cols [16-39]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 32) moved up
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 32) moved up

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move UP'. The Player Character moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) North from grid coordinate (4,4) to (4,3). The move counter in the Top UI decremented by one unit.
Why this outcome: The Player was positioned at (4,4). The target tile immediately North at (4,3) consisted of empty Muted Green floor (Color 3). Since there were no walls or obstacles blocking the path, the movement executed normally as a standard step.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

COLOR CHANGED: 1 objects
  * Object at (62, 12): color 3 -> 14

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The Player moved UP (North) into the Goal tile. This triggered a successful level completion interaction (likely due to holding the Key), resulting in a complete level transition to a new room layout (Stage 2).
Why this outcome: The Player was positioned at grid (4,3) directly below the Goal at (4,2). The Player possessed a Key (collected in previous steps) that matched the Goal's symbol. The 'Move UP' action brought the player into contact with the Goal, satisfying the win condition.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION4

Context: The player spawned in Stage 2 at grid (3,5). The local map geometry at this start point is a vertical 'dead end' corridor with walls to the Left, Right, and Down. The only open path is Up (North). Attempts to move Right into the wall fail silently.
Changes: No changes detected. The action had no visible effect on the game state.
Objects changed: No object-level changes detected

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] NO EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move RIGHT' (Action 4). However, the action resulted in NO CHANGE to the environment. The player character remained at grid position (3, 5) (pixels x:24, y:40).
Why this outcome: The player is positioned at grid coordinates x:3, y:5 (pixel columns 24-31, rows 40-47). The immediate tile to the RIGHT (x:4, y:5; pixels 32-39) contains a solid Bright Green wall (Color 4), which is not walkable. As the 'Move Right' action requires an empty floor tile (Color 3) to execute, the movement was blocked and no Move Counter resource was consumed.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION4

Context: Stage 2. Player is at the start position (3,5) in a vertical corridor. To the immediate Right is a wall. The player attempted to move Right into the wall.
Changes: No changes detected. The action had no visible effect on the game state.
Objects changed: No object-level changes detected

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] NO EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move RIGHT' (Action 4). however, the action resulted in NO CHANGE to the game state. The Player Character attempted to move East from grid (3,5) but was blocked.
Why this outcome: The Player Character is located at grid coordinates (3,5) (pixels x:24, y:40). The target destination for a 'Move Right' action is grid (4,5) (pixels x:32, y:40). This target area contains a solid Bright Green Wall (Color 4), which is an impassable obstacle. The game's collision logic prevented the move and, consequently, did not deduct a 'move' resource from the UI counter.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION2

Context: The player is navigating a vertical corridor in Stage 2. Having failed to move Right previously, the player successfully moved Down. The current position is now (3,6), appearing to be the bottom corner of a path segment.
Changes: Total: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_left_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-55], cols [2-31]
Objects changed: MOVED: 2 objects
  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 24) moved down
  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 24) moved down

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move DOWN'. The Player Character (composite Purple/Cyan block) moved 8 pixels (1 grid unit) South from grid position (3,5) to (3,6). This movement consumed 1 unit from the Move Counter in the top UI.
Why this outcome: The player was positioned at grid (3,5). The target tile immediately South at (3,6) (pixels x:24, y:48) consisted of empty Muted Green floor tiles (Color 3). Since the path was unobstructed by walls or obstacles, the move executed successfully.
Consistent: True

  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The player spawned in Stage 2 at grid (3,5). The local map geometry at this start point is a vertical 'dead end' corridor with walls to the Left, Right, and Down. The only open path is Up (North). Attempts to move Right into the wall fail silently.
      Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move RIGHT' (Action 4). However, the action resulted in NO CHANGE to the environment. The player character remained at grid position (3, 5) (pixels x:24, y:40).
  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: Stage 2. Player is at the start position (3,5) in a vertical corridor. To the immediate Right is a wall. The player attempted to move Right into the wall.
      Interpretation: The visible action was 'Move RIGHT' (Action 4). however, the action resulted in NO CHANGE to the game state. The Player Character attempted to move East from grid (3,5) but was blocked.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Muted Green (Color 3) is Floor, Bright Green (Color 1) is Void/Wall

BORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 1))
  Description: Solid 1-thick border of bright green pixels surrounding the play area.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Snail-shell / Spiral layout. Start point is isolated in the middle-left. Path requires moving Down -> Right -> Up around a central wall to access the rest of the level.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A grid-based puzzle game where the player must navigate a maze-like floor plan, avoiding walls (Bright Green). The objective is to collect a key (Purple Debris) to unlock a path (likely the Red Block) to reach the Goal (Yellow Square), all within a limited number of moves (Move Counter).

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.
  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.
  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).
  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.
  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.
  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.
  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.
  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.
  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).
  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.
  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).
  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).
  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).
  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.
  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).
  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.
  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.
  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.
  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.
  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.
  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.
  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.
  - Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).
  - Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.
  - Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.
  - Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.
  - LEVEL TRANSITION CONFIRMED: Successfully completing the objective in Stage 1 loaded a new map (Stage 2) and reset the player position and UI move counter.
  - NEW OBJECT: 'Red Block' (Color 15) identified at Grid (2,2). Its function (Wall/Hazard/Switch) is currently unknown but it marks a distinct path feature.
  - PATH PUZZLE IDENTIFIED: Direct path to goal (Left) is blocked by void. The valid path requires a winding route (Right->Up->Left->Down) to collect the Key and reach the Goal.
  - PERSISTENCE: The 'Key' mechanic is consistent; a new Key object exists in this level, matching the Goal's lock symbol.
  - CONFIRMED WALL COLLISION: Attempting to move Right from (3,5) into Wall (4,5) had no effect and consumed no resources.
  - MAP TOPOLOGY REVEALED: The path is a spiral. Start -> Key -> Red Block -> Goal.
  - CRITICAL CHOKE POINT: The Red Block at (1,1) separates the Start/Key zone from the Goal zone. It must be an interactable Door/Gate.
  - Corrected Player Position coordinates to (3,5) based on wall collision evidence.
  - Confirmed Barrier at Grid (4,5): Despite appearing as reachable floor, the physics prevented movement East, implying an invisible barrier or specific path constraint encouraging Upward movement.
  - Identified Map 'Quest' Flow: The layout forces the player away from the Goal initially (Up/Right towards Key) before looping back to the Gate (Top Left) and finally the Goal (Bottom Left).
  - Verified Action Failure: Blocked moves do not consume the specialized 'Move Counter' resource (dots remain consistent).
  - Object Role Persistence: Key and Goal objects utilize the same visual language as Stage 1, confirming consistent mechanics.
  - PATH CONFIRMATION: The Player's start position (3,5) is effectively a dead-end in 3 directions (Left, Right, Up-backtrack). The only forward path is DOWN to (3,6) then RIGHT to (4,6).
  - GEOMETRY REFINED: A wall exists at Grid (4,5) which forces the player to take a 'U-turn' at the bottom of the map (Down->Right) to access the vertical corridor on the right side.
  - DEAD END CLARIFICATION: The 'Red Block' at (1,1) and 'Goal' at (1,5) are separated by a vertical void (rows 2-4 in column 1), implying a mechanic (teleport/bridge) is needed to traverse from top-left to bottom-left.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The specific interaction result with the Red Block (Action 5 or bumping?)
  - The area strictly East of the player (Grid 4,6-5,6) - expected to be floor.

      Evidence: Moves in response to actions, tracked by camera/UI.
  - Key/Debris: Purple/Black Small Debris (Role hypothesis: collectible_key)
      Evidence: Distinct small object located at (4,3), matches inventory slot shape.
  - Red Block: Dark Red (Color 2) 8x8 Square (Role hypothesis: obstacle_gate)
      Evidence: Distinct colored block at (1,1) guarding the top-left corner.
  - Goal: Yellow with Purple Symbol 8x8 Square (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Matches goal object from Stage 1.
  - Move Counter: Red/Orange/Grey Row of dots (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)
      Evidence: Decrementing dots in top-left UI with each move.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Does the 'Red Block' behave as a door that opens when the Key is collected?
  - Is there a hidden bridge between (1,1) and (1,5), or is the path purely backtracking?
  - What is the specific trigger for the Red Block?

Recent Observations:
  - Confirmed that blocked moves (collisions with walls) do not consume Move Counter resources.
  - Re-verified map geometry: Position (4,5) is a solid Wall.
  - Corrected Map Topology: The corridor at (3,5) is not a dead end forcing upward movement; it connects South to (3,6).
  - Validated Floor: The tile at Grid (3,6) is confirmed to be valid, walkable Muted Green floor.
  - Pathfinding: The local geometry appears to be a 'U' turn or corner. Since (3,5) blocked Right and (2,5) is Wall, and (3,6) is now occupied, the likely path continues Right from (3,6).

I'm showing you 2 LABELED images:
1. IMAGE 1: The frame BEFORE the action
2. IMAGE 2: The frame AFTER the action (final state)

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!
2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects
3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context
4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)
5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect
6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.
7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.

Analyze what happened and provide your structured analysis.
