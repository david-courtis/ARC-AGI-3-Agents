Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state!

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Bright Green (Color 1)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 1))\n  Description: The play area is carved out of a solid Bright Green field. Any Bright Green area acts as a hard boundary or void.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  8x8 Pixel Grid. The map is 'Room 1'. Player is now at (4,4). Goal is at (4,2). Path to goal (4,3) is clear floor.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A grid-based puzzle game where the player must collect specific items (Keys/Fragments) to unlock or activate a Goal. Movement is limited by a step counter (Top UI). The display includes the main play area, a move counter (Top), and an inventory status area (Bottom Left).\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.\n  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.\n  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.\n  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.\n  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.\n  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.\n  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).\n  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).\n  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.\n  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).\n  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.\n  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.\n  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.\n  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.\n  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.\n  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.\n  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The exact behavior of the Goal tile interaction (win state animation?)\n  - The failure state (running out of time/falling in hole)\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.\n  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).\n  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.\n  - Player movement is locked to 8-pixel grid steps.\n  - Movement consumes 'Move Counter' resources.\n  - Player confined to Muted Green (Color 3) regions.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas (walls/holes).\n  - Movement is quantized to 8 pixels per action.\n  - Movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter resource.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Debris at (4,4) likely blocks direct Northward movement from (4,5).\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas.\n  - Movement consumes 1 Top-UI resource.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel steps.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2\n  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)\n  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area\n  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)\n  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid\n  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)\n  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3\n  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle\n  - Rectangular Void (Hole) at Grid Column 2, spanning Rows 2 and 3\n  - Debris Object at Grid (4,4) likely acts as an obstacle or interactable block\n  - Rectangular Hole/Void (Bright Green) at Grid Column 2, Rows 2-3\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Player Character: Purple body, Cyan top 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: Moves in response to commands; central active element.\n  - Goal: Yellow background, Purple/Black symbol 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Distinct visual marking (Yellow); target of the path.\n  - Collectible Key/Fragment (Previously 'Debris'): Purple and Black Small irregular 8x8 sprite (Role hypothesis: collectible)\n      Evidence: Object at (4,4) DISAPPEARED when player entered the tile. A matching icon simultaneously appeared/updated in the Bottom-Left UI.\n  - Inventory Display: Purple/Black icon on black/green background UI Icon (Role hypothesis: ui_element)\n      Evidence: Located in bottom-left corner outside play grid; updated appearance exactly when the map object was collected.\n  - Hole/Void: Bright Green Vertical Rectangle (16x8 pixels) (Role hypothesis: obstacle)\n      Evidence: Interrupts the Muted Green floor; matches background wall color.\n  - Move Counter: Multicolor dots Linear array (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)\n      Evidence: Decrements/changes with each move.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Does the player need to manually 'use' the collected item on the goal, or just walk onto it?\n  - What happens if the move counter runs out?\n  - Is the Hole purely a wall or does it kill the player?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Debris (Row 4, Col 4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Bottom UI Element: Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Confirmed Grid (4,5) is valid walkable floor\n  - Debris objects are NOT solid walls; they are destructible/collectible obstacles.\n  - Moving into Debris clears it from the map.\n  - Clearing Debris triggers a state change in the Bottom-Left UI (likely counting keys or score).\n  - The path to the Goal (Row 2, Col 4) is now clear.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
