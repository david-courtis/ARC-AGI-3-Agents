  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "The player is currently at grid position (4,4) having just collected the debris/key. The path North to the Goal at (4,2) is now unobstructed. Executing ACTION1 (Move UP) again will move the player to (4,3), positioning them directly adjacent to the goal. This will also provide the third successful observation required to mark ACTION1 as a 'Verified' movement action (currently 2/3 consistent).",
  "expected_information_gain": "Confirm that ACTION1 consistently moves the player 8 pixels UP into an empty floor tile, completing its verification. We also want to observe if holding the collected item affects movement.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player is at (4,4). The debris obstacle is gone. The path to the goal (Yellow tile at 4,2) is open. The immediate tile North (4,3) is verifying as walkable Muted Green floor."
