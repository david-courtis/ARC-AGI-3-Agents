  "reasoning": "The player is currently positioned in the bottom-right area of the playable grid (estimated 5,5). The space to the LEFT (5,4) appears to be open floor (Muted Green) based on visual analysis. Since ACTION3 (Move Left) is only tentatively verified (1/3), executing it now provides a high-probability opportunity to confirm its behavior, increment the movement verification count, and advance the player towards the center of the map where the Debris and Goal are located.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to see the player verify 'Move Left' by shifting -8 pixels on the x-axis. This will provide the 2nd confirmation needed for ACTION3's definition. We also expect the UI Move Counter to decrement. Successful movement will place the player at (5,4), directly south of the debris object, enabling future interaction testing.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player is at the bottom-right limit of the room (approx 5,5). Walls (Bright Green) block movement DOWN and RIGHT. The path UP and LEFT is clear. A debris object is visible diagonally up-left at (4,4)."
