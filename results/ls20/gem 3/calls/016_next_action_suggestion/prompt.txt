=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

=== STAGE/LEVEL INFO ===
Current Stage: 1 (score: 0/254)
Actions in this stage: 6

ACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):
  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)
  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)
  ACTION3: Move LEFT (decrease column/x)
  ACTION4: Move RIGHT (increase column/x)

⚠️ NOTE: Only 4 actions are available in this game: ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player object (8x8 purple block with cyan top) UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels), provided the target space is empty (floor color 3).
  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player character DOWN by 8 pixels (1 grid unit). Consumes 1 move resource.
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the RIGHT (Positive X direction). Requires open floor (Color 3) in the target space.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Bright Green (Color 1 - Boundary/Void)

BORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 1))
  Description: The play area is a non-rectangular room filled with Muted Green (Color 3) floor digits, surrounded by a solid Bright Green (Color 1) void which acts as a wall.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  8x8 Pixel Grid system. Playable Room bounds approx Rows 2-6, Cols 2-6. Layout currently maps: Hole @ (2,2)-(3,2), Goal @ (2,4), Debris @ (4,4), Player @ (5,5). Floor is Muted Green.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A 2D grid-based puzzle game where the player navigates a room to reach a goal (Yellow tile). Key mechanics include obstacle avoidance (Debris/Holes) and resource management (Move Counter). Movement is discrete (step-based) and confined to safe floor tiles.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.
  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.
  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).
  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.
  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.
  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.
  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.
  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.
  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).
  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.
  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).
  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).
  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).
  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.
  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The specific behavior of the Debris object (interaction testing required).
  - The interaction with the Goal object (reaching it).
  - The orange squares in the top-right UI.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).
  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.
  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.
  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.
  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).
  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.
  - Player movement is locked to 8-pixel grid steps.
  - Movement consumes 'Move Counter' resources.
  - Player confined to Muted Green (Color 3) regions.
  - Player constrained to Muted Green floor tiles.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas (walls/holes).
  - Movement is quantized to 8 pixels per action.
  - Movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter resource.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2
  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)
  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area
  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)
  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid
  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)
  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3
  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Player Character: Purple body, Cyan top 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: Controlled by actions; moves across the grid; tracked by camera/focus.
  - Goal: Yellow background, Black/Purple symbol 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Distinct visual design (gold/bright), located centrally in a distinct corridor (Row 2, Col 4).
  - Debris: Purple and Black 8x8 Irregular/Small (Role hypothesis: obstacle)
      Evidence: Located at Grid (4,4); visually distinct from floor; sits in the path between player and goal.
  - Hole: Bright Green 8x16 Vertical Rectangle (Role hypothesis: hazard)
      Evidence: Region of 'background' color inside the 'floor' area (Col 2); visually indicates a void or pit.
  - Move Counter: Grey/Red dots Linear array of small squares (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)
      Evidence: Located in top UI; updates/decrements exactly when the player moves (1 pixel change observed in UI region).
  - Level Indicator / Decoration: Black 'L' shape with Purple square L-Shape (Role hypothesis: ui_element)
      Evidence: Static element in bottom-left; likely indicates Level 1 or simply decorative.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Is the Debris at (4,4) pushable (Sokoban mechanic) or a static wall?
  - Does the Hole at Col 2 cause instant failure or just block movement?
  - What is the function of the orange squares in the top right UI?
  - Does the move counter reaching zero trigger a Game Over?

Legacy Objects:
  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - Confirmed Player moves 8 pixels UP in response to ACTION1.
  - Reconfirmed Debris location at grid (4,4), adjacent to the player's new position.
  - Verified movement affects exactly 128 pixels in the play area (swapping one 8x8 tile for another) plus 1 pixel in the UI.
  - Confirmed ACTION2 is 'Move Down'
  - Verified Grid (5,5) is safe, walkable Muted Green floor

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action
