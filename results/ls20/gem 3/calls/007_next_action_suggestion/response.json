  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not yet been observed. Investigating the fundamental movement set is the highest priority. Visual analysis confirms clear floor space to the RIGHT of the player, making this a safe and effective test for the 'Move Right' hypothesis without risk of collision.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the player character (Purple/Cyan block) move 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the right. This will confirm the function of ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player is positioned centrally with safe movement options to the Left, Right, and Down. Directly North is a potential obstacle (debris). Testing unverified movement in clear directions (Right/Down) is prioritized over interaction testing."
