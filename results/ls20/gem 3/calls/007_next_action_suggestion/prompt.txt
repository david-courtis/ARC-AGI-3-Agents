=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

Current Stage: 1 (score: 0/254)
Actions in this stage: 3

ACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):
  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)
  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)
  ACTION3: Move LEFT (decrease column/x)
  ACTION4: Move RIGHT (increase column/x)

⚠️ NOTE: Only 4 actions are available in this game: ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player object (8x8 purple block with cyan top) UP by 1 grid unit (8 pixels), provided the target space is empty (floor color 3).
  ACTION2: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.
  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Muted Green (Color 3) - Floor

BORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 0/1))
  Description: The playable area is defined by 'negative space' in a large block of Bright Green. The Bright Green color acts as a solid wall/void.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  8x8 Grid based layout. Playable floor is Muted Green. Walls are Bright Green. Irregular room shape.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A grid-based navigation puzzle game. The player controls a purple block and must navigate a maze-like room defined by bright green walls. The goal appears to be reaching the yellow face character. Movement is quantized to a grid. There is a move limit or counter displayed at the top.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.
  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.
  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).
  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.
  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The specific interaction with the small purple debris.
  - The dashed grey line at the bottom of the screen.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).
  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.
  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.
  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.
  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)
  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2
  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Player Character: Purple with Cyan Top 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: Observed moving based on action inputs; visual focus of the screen.
  - Goal/NPC: Yellow with Black/Purple face 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Unique visual design, distinct from walls and player. Usually indicates a destination.
  - Debris/Obstacle: Purple and Black Small irregular 8x8 patch (Role hypothesis: obstacle)
      Evidence: Located directly on the grid path (x:4, y:4). Distinct from floor but matches palette of the 'L' shape. Likely blocks movement.
  - Move Counter: Red, Grey/Green Row of small squares (Role hypothesis: resource_counter)
      Evidence: Top UI elements changed state (one pixel/dot) after a successful move.
  - Lives Indicator: Orange Three squares (Role hypothesis: lives_indicator)
      Evidence: Static UI element in top right, count of 3 usually implies lives.
  - Level Indicator / Mystery L: Black and Purple L-shape (3 blocks) (Role hypothesis: ui_info_or_decoration)
      Evidence: Located in bottom left border margin, outside main play area. Could indicate 'Level 1'.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Will the debris at (4,4) block movement or is it collectible/pushable?
  - Does the move counter count down (limit) or up (score)?
  - What is the function of the large 'L' in the bottom left?

Legacy Objects:
  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - The 8x8 Purple/Cyan block responds to movement controls, identifying it as the likely Player Character.
  - Movement occurs in 8-pixel steps (1 grid unit).
  - Confirmed ACTION3 is 'Move Left'.
  - Reconfirmed 'Muted Green' (Color 3) is valid walkable terrain.
  - Movement is quantized to 8x8 pixel blocks.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action
