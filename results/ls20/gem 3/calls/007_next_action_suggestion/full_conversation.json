Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration.

ACTION1: \u2713 EFFECT - The visible action was 'Move UP'. The large purple block wit...\n  2. ACTION3: \u2713 EFFECT - The Player Character (Purple/Cyan block) moved 8 pixels (1 g...\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n\u26a0\ufe0f NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Muted Green (Color 3) - Floor\n\nBORDER: Yes (Bright Green (Color 0/1))\n  Description: The playable area is defined by 'negative space' in a large block of Bright Green. The Bright Green color acts as a solid wall/void.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  8x8 Grid based layout. Playable floor is Muted Green. Walls are Bright Green. Irregular room shape.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A grid-based navigation puzzle game. The player controls a purple block and must navigate a maze-like room defined by bright green walls. The goal appears to be reaching the yellow face character. Movement is quantized to a grid. There is a move limit or counter displayed at the top.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.\n  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The specific interaction with the small purple debris.\n  - The dashed grey line at the bottom of the screen.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.\n  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2\n  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Player Character: Purple with Cyan Top 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: Observed moving based on action inputs; visual focus of the screen.\n  - Goal/NPC: Yellow with Black/Purple face 8x8 Square Block (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Unique visual design, distinct from walls and player. Usually indicates a destination.\n  - Debris/Obstacle: Purple and Black Small irregular 8x8 patch (Role hypothesis: obstacle)\n      Evidence: Located directly on the grid path (x:4, y:4). Distinct from floor but matches palette of the 'L' shape. Likely blocks movement.\n  - Move Counter: Red, Grey/Green Row of small squares (Role hypothesis: resource_counter)\n      Evidence: Top UI elements changed state (one pixel/dot) after a successful move.\n  - Lives Indicator: Orange Three squares (Role hypothesis: lives_indicator)\n      Evidence: Static UI element in top right, count of 3 usually implies lives.\n  - Level Indicator / Mystery L: Black and Purple L-shape (3 blocks) (Role hypothesis: ui_info_or_decoration)\n      Evidence: Located in bottom left border margin, outside main play area. Could indicate 'Level 1'.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Will the debris at (4,4) block movement or is it collectible/pushable?\n  - Does the move counter count down (limit) or up (score)?\n  - What is the function of the large 'L' in the bottom left?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 8x8 Purple/Cyan block responds to movement controls, identifying it as the likely Player Character.\n  - Movement occurs in 8-pixel steps (1 grid unit).\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 is 'Move Left'.\n  - Reconfirmed 'Muted Green' (Color 3) is valid walkable terrain.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8x8 pixel blocks.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
