BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking change?\n- What color/pattern indicates a boundary vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

The Player Character attempted to move East from grid (3,5) but was blocked.\nWhy This Outcome: The Player Character is located at grid coordinates (3,5) (pixels x:24, y:40). The target destination for a 'Move Right' action is grid (4,5) (pixels x:32, y:40). This target area contains a solid Bright Green Wall (Color 4), which is an impassable obstacle.

It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).\n- Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.\n- Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).\n- Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).\n- Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).\n- Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.\n- Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).\n- Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.\n- Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.\n- Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.\n- CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.\n- Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.\n- The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.\n- Player path to goal is now unobstructed.\n- Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).\n- Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.\n- Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.\n- Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.\n- LEVEL TRANSITION CONFIRMED: Successfully completing the objective in Stage 1 loaded a new map (Stage 2) and reset the player position and UI move counter.\n- NEW OBJECT: 'Red Block' (Color 15) identified at Grid (2,2). Its function (Wall/Hazard/Switch) is currently unknown but it marks a distinct path feature.\n- PATH PUZZLE IDENTIFIED: Direct path to goal (Left) is blocked by void. The valid path requires a winding route (Right->Up->Left->Down) to collect the Key and reach the Goal.\n- PERSISTENCE: The 'Key' mechanic is consistent; a new Key object exists in this level, matching the Goal's lock symbol.\n- CONFIRMED WALL COLLISION: Attempting to move Right from (3,5) into Wall (4,5) had no effect and consumed no resources.\n- MAP TOPOLOGY REVEALED: The path is a spiral. Start -> Key -> Red Block -> Goal.\n- CRITICAL CHOKE POINT: The Red Block at (1,1) separates the Start/Key zone from the Goal zone. It must be an interactable Door/Gate.\n- Corrected Player Position coordinates to (3,5) based on wall collision evidence.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- Does the Red Block open automatically upon collecting the Key, or is it a 'push' block?\n- Does the bottom-left UI icon indicate 'Key Held' or 'Key Needed'?\n- Does the score (1/254) imply a persistent campaign across levels?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"Move UP 8 pixels. Interact with Key (Collect) or Goal (Win if Key held).\"\n  ACTION2: \"Move the player character DOWN by 8 pixels (1 grid unit). Consumes 1 move resource.\"\n  ACTION3: \"Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the Left.\"\n  ACTION4: \"Move the player object 8 pixels (1 grid unit) to the RIGHT (Positive X direction). Requires open floor (Color 3) in the target space.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n7. UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS: Which colors or sections of the grid have NOT been thoroughly analyzed yet? List specific colors or regions that need more investigation.\n8. DOMAIN DESCRIPTION: Provide a high-level conceptual description of the game. What type of game is this (puzzle, navigation, sokoban-like, etc.)? What appears to be the goal? How do the mechanics work together at a conceptual level?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
