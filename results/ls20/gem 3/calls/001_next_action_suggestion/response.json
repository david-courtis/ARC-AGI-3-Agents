  "reasoning": "No actions have been observed yet. The semantic hint suggests ACTION1 is 'Move UP'. The player character appears to have open space located immediately above them, making this a valid direction to test fundamental movement without obstruction.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to verify if ACTION1 moves the player character upwards (decreasing Y coordinate).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game appears to be a 2D top-down puzzle. The player character is in the center of a room with green walls. There is a yellow item to the north and a purple exit/gate to the south."
