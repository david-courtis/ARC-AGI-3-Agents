=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

BACKGROUND: Color 1 (Bright Green)

BORDER: Yes (Color 1 (Bright Green))
  Description: The play area is defined by a solid mask of Bright Green (Color 1), creating a shaped 'room' with internal voids.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Grid-based maze with narrow corridors. Current topology indicates a path from Start (4,6) -> Left (3,6) -> Up (towards Key at 4,3) -> Backtrack/Loop -> Goal (1,5). The direct path North from Start (4,6 to 4,5) appears blocked, forcing the Left-Up detour.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A grid-based puzzle game where the player must navigate a maze-like floor layout, avoiding walls and voids. The core loop involves moving 1 tile at a time to collect a Key (Purple) which unlocks access to the Goal (Yellow), while managing a limited move count.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.
  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.
  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).
  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.
  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.
  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.
  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.
  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.
  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).
  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.
  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).
  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).
  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).
  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.
  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).
  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.
  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.
  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.
  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.
  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.
  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.
  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.
  - Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).
  - Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.
  - Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.
  - Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.
  - LEVEL TRANSITION CONFIRMED: Successfully completing the objective in Stage 1 loaded a new map (Stage 2) and reset the player position and UI move counter.
  - NEW OBJECT: 'Red Block' (Color 15) identified at Grid (2,2). Its function (Wall/Hazard/Switch) is currently unknown but it marks a distinct path feature.
  - PATH PUZZLE IDENTIFIED: Direct path to goal (Left) is blocked by void. The valid path requires a winding route (Right->Up->Left->Down) to collect the Key and reach the Goal.
  - PERSISTENCE: The 'Key' mechanic is consistent; a new Key object exists in this level, matching the Goal's lock symbol.
  - CONFIRMED WALL COLLISION: Attempting to move Right from (3,5) into Wall (4,5) had no effect and consumed no resources.
  - MAP TOPOLOGY REVEALED: The path is a spiral. Start -> Key -> Red Block -> Goal.
  - CRITICAL CHOKE POINT: The Red Block at (1,1) separates the Start/Key zone from the Goal zone. It must be an interactable Door/Gate.
  - Corrected Player Position coordinates to (3,5) based on wall collision evidence.
  - Confirmed Barrier at Grid (4,5): Despite appearing as reachable floor, the physics prevented movement East, implying an invisible barrier or specific path constraint encouraging Upward movement.
  - Identified Map 'Quest' Flow: The layout forces the player away from the Goal initially (Up/Right towards Key) before looping back to the Gate (Top Left) and finally the Goal (Bottom Left).
  - Verified Action Failure: Blocked moves do not consume the specialized 'Move Counter' resource (dots remain consistent).
  - Object Role Persistence: Key and Goal objects utilize the same visual language as Stage 1, confirming consistent mechanics.
  - PATH CONFIRMATION: The Player's start position (3,5) is effectively a dead-end in 3 directions (Left, Right, Up-backtrack). The only forward path is DOWN to (3,6) then RIGHT to (4,6).
  - GEOMETRY REFINED: A wall exists at Grid (4,5) which forces the player to take a 'U-turn' at the bottom of the map (Down->Right) to access the vertical corridor on the right side.
  - DEAD END CLARIFICATION: The 'Red Block' at (1,1) and 'Goal' at (1,5) are separated by a vertical void (rows 2-4 in column 1), implying a mechanic (teleport/bridge) is needed to traverse from top-left to bottom-left.
  - CONFIRMED LAYOUT: The map is a 'Spiral' requiring collection and backtracking. Player start -> Right -> Up (Key) -> Backtrack/Right -> Loop around -> Goal.
  - OBJECT LOCATION: Key is located at Grid (4,4), exactly 2 grid steps North of the Player's current position (4,6).
  - PATH VERIFICATION: The path to the Right (Col 5) and Up (Col 4) is clear Muted Green floor.
  - SCORE/RESOURCE: 'Score' increased to 1, likely tracking the number of steps taken or effective moves.
  - CONFIRMED WALL: Action 2 failure proves a solid boundary exists at Grid (4,7), directly below the player.
  - DEAD END: The player is currently positioned at the very bottom of the central corridor. The only valid movement direction is UP (North) towards the Key.
  - PUZZLE TOPOLOGY: Validated 'Key-Gated Spiral' layout. The player must move UP to collect the Key, then backtrack/loop around the entire map to approach the Red Gate from the North-West to reach the Goal.
  - STARTING STATE CLARIFICATION: Stage 2 forces an immediate collection/backtrack sequence.
  - CONFIRMED PATHING LOGIC: The 'Wall' at Grid (4,5) enforces the specific move sequence Start(4,6)->Left(3,6)->Up, preventing a direct shortcut to the Key.
  - UPDATED OBJECT LOCATIONS: Player at (3,6), Key at (4,3), Goal at (1,5).
  - DEBRIS CLARIFICATION: The purple object at bottom-left is likely a UI Inventory element, while the interactable Key is at (4,3).
  - RESOURCE UPDATES: Move counter decremented by 1 dot; score remains 1.

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Player Character: Purple (Color 4) with Cyan (Color 6) top 8x8 pixel block (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: Controlled by actions, tracked by camera/state updates
  - Key / Fragment: Purple (Color 4) and Black (Color 0) Small distinct symbol/debris (Role hypothesis: collectible_key)
      Evidence: Similar object collected in Stage 1; matches symbol on Goal; located at dead-end of path
  - Goal: Yellow (Color 13) with Purple Symbol 8x8 pixel block (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: End point of Stage 1; visually distinct; marked with key symbol
  - Red Block: Dark Red (Color 2) 8x8 pixel block (Role hypothesis: obstacle_gate)
      Evidence: Distinct color (Color 2) often used for 'locked' doors or hazards; located at map extremity (1,1)
  - Move Counter: Orange/Red dots Row of UI elements (Role hypothesis: resource_limit)
      Evidence: Decayed by 1 unit after successful move
  - Inventory Indicator: Purple/Black Icon at bottom left (Grid 0,7 region) (Role hypothesis: ui_status)
      Evidence: Appears in UI margin; matches Key visual

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Is the Red Block at (1,1) strictly a wall, or can it be opened/interacted with?
  - Does the path from Key to Goal require full backtracking or is there a loop connection?
  - Is the tile at (2,5) accessible from (3,5) to allow approach to the Goal?

Legacy Objects:
  - Player Block (Purple/Cyan 8x8 shape): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Purple/Cyan block): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Top UI Move Counter: Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Counter (Top UI): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Player Character: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Move Counter: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Debris (Row 4, Col 4): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Bottom UI Element: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Goal/Lock: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Key (Inventory): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Player Character (Color 12/Purple Block): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Wall (Bright Green): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Floor (Muted Green): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Player Character (Color 12/9 Block): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Floor Tile (3,6): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Player Character (Color 12 top, Color 9 body): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Floor Tile at (4, 6) (Destination): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Floor Tile at (3, 6) (Origin): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Bottom Boundary Wall: Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - Confirmed that the wall blocking the rightward path exists only at Row 5 in this section, while Row 6 behaves as an open corridor.
  - Verified that grid coordinates (4, 6) are walkable floor.
  - Confirmed solid boundary wall at grid row 7 (pixels y:56-63).
  - Confirmed grid coordinates (3, 6) are valid walkable floor.
  - Confirmed the bottom path consists of at least columns 3, 4, and 5 at Row 6.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): None

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION2: 1 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION4: 2 recent no-effect attempts

AVOID EXPECTED NO-OPS: If you believe an action will cause a no-op in the current state (based on your understanding of the environment), please choose a different action or use a setup sequence to change position first.
Actions with recent no-ops:
  ACTION2: 1 consecutive no-effects (last reason: The Player Character is positioned at y-grid 6 (pixels 48-55), which is the bott...)

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action

Provide your structured suggestion.
