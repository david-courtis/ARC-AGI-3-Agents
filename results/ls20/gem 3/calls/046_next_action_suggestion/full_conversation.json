Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state!

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 1 (Bright Green)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 1 (Bright Green))\n  Description: The play area is defined by a solid mask of Bright Green (Color 1), creating a shaped 'room' with internal voids.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based maze with narrow corridors. Current topology indicates a path from Start (4,6) -> Left (3,6) -> Up (towards Key at 4,3) -> Backtrack/Loop -> Goal (1,5). The direct path North from Start (4,6 to 4,5) appears blocked, forcing the Left-Up detour.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A grid-based puzzle game where the player must navigate a maze-like floor layout, avoiding walls and voids. The core loop involves moving 1 tile at a time to collect a Key (Purple) which unlocks access to the Goal (Yellow), while managing a limited move count.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Muted Green' is the walkable floor and 'Bright Green' is the boundary/wall.\n  - identified top-left UI dots as a localized move/time counter that updates with actions.\n  - Verified player object is a composite of Purple (body) and Cyan (top edge).\n  - Identified a specific small object (Purple/Black debris) at grid (4,4) directly North of the player's current position. This may be an obstacle.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 (Move Left) moves the player 8 pixels.\n  - Confirmed movement logic aligns perfectly with an 8x8 pixel grid.\n  - Spatial mapping refined: Player is currently at grid (5,4). Debris is at (4,3). Goal is at (4,2). Hole is at column 2.\n  - Confirmed 'Move Counter' mechanism: The UI represents a finite resource (time or steps) that acts as a gameplay constraint.\n  - Internal Obstacle identified: A distinct 'Hole' (Bright Green void) exists at approx grid (2,2-3), narrowing the path on the left.\n  - CORRECTION: Debris object precise location confirmed at Grid (4,4) (previously estimated as 4,3). It is directly to the LEFT of the Player's current position (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Move Counter functionality: Top-left UI dots update (decrement) when a successful move occurs.\n  - Confirmed 'Hole' geometry: A 2-tile high vertical void at Column 2 (Rows 2 and 3).\n  - Player Position Update: Player successfully moved from (5,5) to (4,5).\n  - Confirmed Grid (5,5) is a valid, walkable floor tile (Muted Green).\n  - Validated 'Clean Movement' hypothesis: The 129 pixel change count matches exactly 1 moved 8x8 object (64 new + 64 old cleared) + 1 UI pixel update.\n  - Established direct link between movement actions and Top-Left UI updates (Move Counter).\n  - Confirmed alignment: Player (4,5), Debris (4,4), and Goal (4,2) are all on Column 4.\n  - Identified tactical situation: Only one tile (Debris) separates the Player from the path to the Goal.\n  - Verified clean movement: 129 pixel change confirms Player moved 8 pixels left into empty space without triggering other dynamic events.\n  - CRITICAL: The 'Debris' object is a COLLECTIBLE Item (Key/Fragment) that is added to the inventory upon entry.\n  - Interaction mechanic identified: Moving into occupied tile (Rule: Consumable items) -> Item removed from map -> Inventory updated.\n  - The symbol on the collected item matches the symbol on the Goal tile, implying a 'Lock and Key' mechanic.\n  - Player path to goal is now unobstructed.\n  - Confirmed Player position at Grid (4,3), directly South of the Goal at (4,2).\n  - Verified Goal object at (4,2) is a Yellow square with a Purple symbol.\n  - Visual confirmation that the symbol on the Goal tile is identical to the symbol of the collected Key (Inventory), strongly supporting a Lock/Key mechanic.\n  - Player is now positioned to attempt interaction with the Goal on the next Move Up.\n  - LEVEL TRANSITION CONFIRMED: Successfully completing the objective in Stage 1 loaded a new map (Stage 2) and reset the player position and UI move counter.\n  - NEW OBJECT: 'Red Block' (Color 15) identified at Grid (2,2). Its function (Wall/Hazard/Switch) is currently unknown but it marks a distinct path feature.\n  - PATH PUZZLE IDENTIFIED: Direct path to goal (Left) is blocked by void. The valid path requires a winding route (Right->Up->Left->Down) to collect the Key and reach the Goal.\n  - PERSISTENCE: The 'Key' mechanic is consistent; a new Key object exists in this level, matching the Goal's lock symbol.\n  - CONFIRMED WALL COLLISION: Attempting to move Right from (3,5) into Wall (4,5) had no effect and consumed no resources.\n  - MAP TOPOLOGY REVEALED: The path is a spiral. Start -> Key -> Red Block -> Goal.\n  - CRITICAL CHOKE POINT: The Red Block at (1,1) separates the Start/Key zone from the Goal zone. It must be an interactable Door/Gate.\n  - Corrected Player Position coordinates to (3,5) based on wall collision evidence.\n  - Confirmed Barrier at Grid (4,5): Despite appearing as reachable floor, the physics prevented movement East, implying an invisible barrier or specific path constraint encouraging Upward movement.\n  - Identified Map 'Quest' Flow: The layout forces the player away from the Goal initially (Up/Right towards Key) before looping back to the Gate (Top Left) and finally the Goal (Bottom Left).\n  - Verified Action Failure: Blocked moves do not consume the specialized 'Move Counter' resource (dots remain consistent).\n  - Object Role Persistence: Key and Goal objects utilize the same visual language as Stage 1, confirming consistent mechanics.\n  - PATH CONFIRMATION: The Player's start position (3,5) is effectively a dead-end in 3 directions (Left, Right, Up-backtrack). The only forward path is DOWN to (3,6) then RIGHT to (4,6).\n  - GEOMETRY REFINED: A wall exists at Grid (4,5) which forces the player to take a 'U-turn' at the bottom of the map (Down->Right) to access the vertical corridor on the right side.\n  - DEAD END CLARIFICATION: The 'Red Block' at (1,1) and 'Goal' at (1,5) are separated by a vertical void (rows 2-4 in column 1), implying a mechanic (teleport/bridge) is needed to traverse from top-left to bottom-left.\n  - CONFIRMED LAYOUT: The map is a 'Spiral' requiring collection and backtracking. Player start -> Right -> Up (Key) -> Backtrack/Right -> Loop around -> Goal.\n  - OBJECT LOCATION: Key is located at Grid (4,4), exactly 2 grid steps North of the Player's current position (4,6).\n  - PATH VERIFICATION: The path to the Right (Col 5) and Up (Col 4) is clear Muted Green floor.\n  - SCORE/RESOURCE: 'Score' increased to 1, likely tracking the number of steps taken or effective moves.\n  - CONFIRMED WALL: Action 2 failure proves a solid boundary exists at Grid (4,7), directly below the player.\n  - DEAD END: The player is currently positioned at the very bottom of the central corridor. The only valid movement direction is UP (North) towards the Key.\n  - PUZZLE TOPOLOGY: Validated 'Key-Gated Spiral' layout. The player must move UP to collect the Key, then backtrack/loop around the entire map to approach the Red Gate from the North-West to reach the Goal.\n  - STARTING STATE CLARIFICATION: Stage 2 forces an immediate collection/backtrack sequence.\n  - CONFIRMED PATHING LOGIC: The 'Wall' at Grid (4,5) enforces the specific move sequence Start(4,6)->Left(3,6)->Up, preventing a direct shortcut to the Key.\n  - UPDATED OBJECT LOCATIONS: Player at (3,6), Key at (4,3), Goal at (1,5).\n  - DEBRIS CLARIFICATION: The purple object at bottom-left is likely a UI Inventory element, while the interactable Key is at (4,3).\n  - RESOURCE UPDATES: Move counter decremented by 1 dot; score remains 1.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The specific connectivity of the floor tiles in Columns 1 and 2 (is there a gap between Red Block and Goal?)\n  - The exact nature of the 'Central Void' shape\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas (walls/void).\n  - Player stays within the Muted Green floor area.\n  - Player moves 8 pixels (1 grid unit) per step.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (void/wall) areas.\n  - Must remain on Muted Green (floor) tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Void/Wall) areas.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel increments (grid-aligned).\n  - Play area is bounded rows ~2-6 and cols ~2-6.\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas.\n  - Player movement is locked to 8-pixel grid steps.\n  - Movement consumes 'Move Counter' resources.\n  - Player confined to Muted Green (Color 3) regions.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) areas (walls/holes).\n  - Movement is quantized to 8 pixels per action.\n  - Movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter resource.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Debris at (4,4) likely blocks direct Northward movement from (4,5).\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green areas.\n  - Movement consumes 1 Top-UI resource.\n  - Movement is quantized to 8-pixel steps.\n  - Movement is quantized effectively to the 8x8 grid.\n  - Successful movement consumes 1 unit of the Move Counter.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) background voids.\n  - Movement is constrained to Muted Green (Color 3) floor tiles.\n  - Must navigate around the central void to reach the Goal.\n  - Movement resets/consumes the visual Move Counter dots at the top left.\n  - Player constrained to Muted Green path.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green walls.\n  - Failed moves (blocked by wall) do NOT consume Move Counter resources.\n  - Red Block (1,1) likely blocks movement until condition met (e.g., collecting key).\n  - Player cannot move into Bright Green (Color 1) walls.\n  - Movement blocked to the RIGHT of current position (3,5) -> (4,5) is a barrier.\n  - Red Block at (1,1) potentially blocks movement until unlocked.\n  - Cannot move into Bright Green walls/voids.\n  - Movement is grid-based (8 pixels).\n  - Previous move Right failed at (3,5), indicating (4,5) is a wall.\n  - Current position (3,6) has a clear path to the East (Right).\n  - Player bounded by Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Cannot enter Bright Green void.\n  - Movement is grid-locked to 8x8 pixels.\n  - Red Block likely acts as a solid wall until an unknown condition (Key collection) is met.\n  - Player blocked from moving SOUTH from (4,6) by boundary wall.\n  - Player bounded Left and Right by internal voids at current position.\n  - Movement restricted to Muted Green floor tiles.\n  - Red Block at (1,1) acts as a conditional barrier.\n  - Player movement quantized to 8 pixels.\n  - Player cannot enter Bright Green (Color 1) areas.\n  - Detailed Layout: Start (4,6) -> Wall (4,5) blocks North. Valid path is West to (3,6).\n  - Goal (1,5) is partially isolated by voids in Column 1.\n  - Key (4,3) is likely accessed from the West (Column 3) due to obstacles.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Rectangular hole (Bright Green) inside the play area (approx grid x:2, y:2)\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid relative x:2, y:2\n  - Possible small obstacle (Purple/Black debris) at grid relative x:4, y:4\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) approx 2x4 blocks on the left side (approx grid x:2, y:2-3)\n  - Solid Bright Green border blocking all movement outside the central room area\n  - Rectangular Void/Hole (Bright Green) at Grid (2,2) and (3,2)\n  - Possible isolated obstacle (Debris) at Grid (4,4) which might be pushable or solid\n  - Solid boundary walls at Row 1 (top), Col 1 (left), Col 6/7 (right), Row 7 (bottom)\n  - Rectangular Hole (Bright Green) at Grid Col 2, spanning Rows 2-3\n  - Debris object (Purple/Black) at Grid (4,4) acting as an obstacle\n  - Rectangular Void (Hole) at Grid Column 2, spanning Rows 2 and 3\n  - Debris Object at Grid (4,4) likely acts as an obstacle or interactable block\n  - Rectangular Hole/Void (Bright Green) at Grid Column 2, Rows 2-3\n  - The play area boundaries define a specific room shape (approx 6x5 walkable area)\n  - Bright Green void separating the Start (Col 4) and Goal (Col 2) columns\n  - Central void creating a winding 'S' or 'U' shaped corridor\n  - Central Void (Bright Green) roughly occupying columns 2-3 in the middle rows, creating a u-shaped or spiral layout.\n  - Wall at (4,5) - Confirmed by blocked movement this turn.\n  - Central blocks of Bright Green creating a spiral path structure\n  - Wall at Grid (4,5) - Visually floor but confirmed blocked by physics\n  - Red Block at Grid (1,1) acting as a dynamic wall/gate\n  - Rectangular void (Bright Green) at grid (2,2) to (2,4)\n  - Wall/Void at grid (4,5) - Confirmed by previous collision\n  - Wall/Void at grid (2,5) - Determining the dead-end nature of the Start point\n  - Gap between Red Block (1,1) and Goal (1,5)\n  - Central Void column (Column 2) separating Start/Key area from Goal area\n  - Bright Green walls defining the 'Spiral' corridor shape\n  - Solid wall directly SOUTH of Player at Grid (4,7)\n  - Vertical void separating Column 1 (Goal/Gate) from Column 3/4 (Key/Player)\n  - Solid walls bounding the central corridor columns 3 and 5\n  - Central Void (Bright Green) preventing direct line of sight between Start, Key, and Goal\n  - Wall at Grid (4,5) blocked direct North movement from Start\n  - Void at Column 1 (Rows 2,3,4) separating Top-Left corner from Goal\n  - Possible barrier separating Grid (2,5) and (1,5) or requiring Key unlock\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Player Character: Purple (Color 4) with Cyan (Color 6) top 8x8 pixel block (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: Controlled by actions, tracked by camera/state updates\n  - Key / Fragment: Purple (Color 4) and Black (Color 0) Small distinct symbol/debris (Role hypothesis: collectible_key)\n      Evidence: Similar object collected in Stage 1; matches symbol on Goal; located at dead-end of path\n  - Goal: Yellow (Color 13) with Purple Symbol 8x8 pixel block (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: End point of Stage 1; visually distinct; marked with key symbol\n  - Red Block: Dark Red (Color 2) 8x8 pixel block (Role hypothesis: obstacle_gate)\n      Evidence: Distinct color (Color 2) often used for 'locked' doors or hazards;
