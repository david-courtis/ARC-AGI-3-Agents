  "reasoning": "The player successfully moved LEFT (Action 3) to grid position (3,6) in the previous turn. The direct path North from the start (4,6) was deemed potentially blocked or suboptimal. Moving UP (Action 1) from the current position (3,6) to (3,5) is the logical next step to advance Northwards along the corridor towards the Key (Item at 4,3). We also need to confirm if Column 3 is the valid vertical corridor.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify that the tile at grid (3,5) is walkable floor (Muted Green) and advance the player closer to the Key object.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Player is at position (3,6). To the North is open floor. To the South is a wall (verified by Action 2 failure). To the Right is the starting tile. To the Left leads towards the Goal but requires navigating the spiral. The immediate objective is to move North to collect the Key."
