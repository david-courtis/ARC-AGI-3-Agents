  "reasoning": "The player has successfully moved DOWN to position (3,6). Previous attempts to move RIGHT failed at (3,5) due to a specific wall at (4,5). However, visual assessment of the current row (Row 6) shows the floor extending to the right, suggesting a corridor that skirts under the wall encountered earlier. Moving RIGHT is the only viable path forward to explore the map, as Left and Down are blocked by the border/walls, and Up is backtracking.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify that the tile at (4,6) is walkable floor (unlike (4,5)) and establish the layout of the bottom corridor, allowing the player to continue navigating the spiral structure towards the right side of the map.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Player is positioned at (3,6) in a corner. To the Left and Down are Bright Green walls/borders. To the North is the previous position (3,5). To the East (Right) appears to be an open Muted Green floor path, essential for progressing through the level's U-shaped layout."
