  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not been observed at all, making it the highest priority for exploration. Since ACTION1 caused movement, we can infer that ACTION2 (Move DOWN) should also cause movement. There is currently ample free space below the active blocks to test downward movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe the effect of ACTION2 (Move DOWN) on the active entity, specifically how it moves and by what increment. This will help us begin verifying its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is good for testing downward movement, as the active blocks are not at the bottom of the play area and there are no immediate obstacles below them."
