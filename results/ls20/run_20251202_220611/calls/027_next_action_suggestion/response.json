  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently shown no effect in the current state, indicating it's either a no-op or requires a different context. Given the 'Critical Rules', if an action had 'NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first'. We need to move the active blocks to a new position before re-testing ACTION5. Since ACTION4 is the most validated movement action (1/3 consistent), it's the most reliable choice for a setup sequence. Moving twice to the right should sufficiently change the position. Afterward, the priority shifts to validating other actions that are not yet verified. ACTION1 has only been attempted once and needs more validation, making it the highest priority unverified action to test after movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing a setup sequence of ACTION4, we will observe its consistent effect on moving the active blocks, further validating ACTION4. Subsequently, testing ACTION1 in a new position will provide more observations to confirm or refine its definition and move it towards verification. This also tests whether the new position allows for a different outcome for future tests of ACTION5.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the two active blocks in particular positions. Multiple attempts with ACTION5 have resulted in no effect. To avoid redundant testing, a change in position is required before re-attempting ACTION5. Additionally, ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 are still highly unverified and need consistent observations."
