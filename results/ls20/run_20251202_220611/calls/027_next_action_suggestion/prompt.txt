Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up, blocked by hard walls (Color 0) or the upper limit of the Color 7 play area.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected objects, if movable, to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate).
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) to move one unit to the left.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves two specific, currently selected/active, rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block) one unit to the right. This action likely acts on 'selected' or 'active' objects as it consistently moves two specific blocks.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 has no currently observable effect on the environment or player entity. It may be a 'no-op', conditional, or its effect is always blocked in current game states.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - The two active/selected blocks appear to be a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block. Their positions can vary.
  - ACTION4 consistently moves these two blocks one unit to the right.
  - ACTION5 might be a no-op or has conditions for effects that have not been met in any observed state.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5
