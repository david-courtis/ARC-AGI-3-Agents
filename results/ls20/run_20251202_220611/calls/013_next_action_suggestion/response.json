  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has been attempted only once and needs more validation. It has not resulted in a 'NO EFFECT' observation in the current state, so no setup sequence is immediately necessary to re-test it in a slightly varied but similar context. Furthermore, we need to gather 3 consistent observations to verify its effect. After the last ACTION4, the objects are at (48,32) and (50,32). We will try moving them further right.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validate the effect of ACTION4 by observing object movement and boundary conditions. We aim for a second consistent observation of its effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game board currently contains movable blocks (color 12 and color 9) that have previously responded to movement actions. The previous ACTION4 attempt moved them, indicating it's a good state to re-test movement actions. There is still space to move right."
