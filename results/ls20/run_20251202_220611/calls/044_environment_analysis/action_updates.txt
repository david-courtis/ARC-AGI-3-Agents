ACTION5: ACTION5 attempts to move the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up, but is always blocked by hard walls (Color 0) or the upper limit of the Color 7 play area in the current observed state.
  Reason: Repeated observations confirm ACTION5 fails to move the player entity when it's against the top Color 0 boundary, reinforcing that it's an attempted upward movement action consistently blocked here.
