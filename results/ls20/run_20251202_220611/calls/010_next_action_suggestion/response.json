  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has no observations yet, making it the highest priority for initial testing. Since we don't know what it does, testing it in the current state is the most efficient way to gather an initial observation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "An initial understanding of what ACTION5 does, whether it interacts with objects, changes the player's state, or has no effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board has several distinct objects. Testing ACTION5 now will provide baseline behavior. If it interacts with objects, we can then strategically move to test it near different objects."
