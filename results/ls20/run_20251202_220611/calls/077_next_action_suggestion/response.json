  "reasoning": "ACTION2 needs more validation as it has only 0/3 consistent observations and 3/8 attempts. It recently caused a level change but also had no effect in other attempts. ACTION5 had a no-effect in the most recent attempt and ACTION4 also had a no-effect. To avoid re-testing actions that recently had no effect in the same state, we must first change the player's position using verified actions. ACTION1 is a verified movement action; using it twice will move the player significant distance from the previous position, ensuring a different context for testing ACTION2. This will allow us to observe if the effect of ACTION2 (reset/level change) is consistent across different starting positions, which is crucial for verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION2 consistently causes a game state reset/level change, or if its effect is context-dependent. This will help us verify its behavior or understand the conditions under which it acts as a reset/level change.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows a complex arrangement of colored blocks. The player entity (purple and black blocks in the bottom left, and yellow and black blocks in the top right part of the green area) is at a specific position. There is sufficient space to move upwards using ACTION1, which will alter the player's position and provide a new context for testing other actions."
