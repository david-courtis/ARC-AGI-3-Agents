Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)\n2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)\n3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to\ndiscover context-dependent behaviors."

This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 primarily causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12, 8x2 and color 9, 8x6) to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate) within the play area, provided they are not at the bottom edge and there are no obstacles directly below them. In specific, previously observed contexts,ACTION2 can also trigger a complete game environment reset or level change, removing all current objects, changing the background, and introducing new sets of objects, including new 'player' entities.\n  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the left within the Color 7 play area. This action impacts UI elements based on interaction.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes a complete game state reset or attempts to move the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the right. This rightward movement is blocked by walls/boundaries.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect on the player entity or environment.\n\nRECENT ACTION HISTORY (last 10 actions taken):\n  1.

The specific conditions that trigger the 'game reset/level change' are still unknown, but seems to occur when the game environment is in a non-standard state (e.g. orange background).\n  - The 'move down' behavior of ACTION2 is consistent across multiple observations now.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION4: 1 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION5: 3 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
