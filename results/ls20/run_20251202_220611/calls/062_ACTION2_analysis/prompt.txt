Analyze the effect of action ACTION2.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION2:
"ACTION2 causes the selected objects, if movable, to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate)."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The game environment contains a prominent light-green play area. Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved upwards with ACTION1, now having returned to a lower position relative to the play area.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both located at column 40, moved one unit downwards. The color 12 block moved from row 40 to 41, and the color 9 block moved from row 42 to 43. This is the opposite of ACTION1.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area. The two active blocks (color 12 and color 9) are positioned within this area, not at its bottom boundary. There are other static blocks and UI elements.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 48, moved one unit downwards. The color 12 block moved from row 24 to 25, and the color 9 block moved from row 26 to 27. Their column positions remained unchanged.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION5 consistently has no visible effect.
  - ACTION5 consistently has no visible effect, suggesting it's either a no-op or requires specific unobserved conditions to trigger a change.
  - ACTION5 is a no-op action.
  - The 'player entity' is composed of a Color 12 (8x2) block and a Color 9 (8x6) block that move together.
  - Movement appears to be confined within the light-green play area (Color 7).
