  "target_action": "ACTION2",

  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 3 recent 'no effect' attempts. The rule states if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first. However, none of the movement actions are yet verified for reliable use in setup sequences (ACTION1 and ACTION4 are only 1/3 consistent). Therefore, the highest priority is to test an unverified core movement action (ACTION2 or ACTION3) that has had few attempts and is not currently blocked. We will try ACTION2 since it has only 1 attempt and might reveal a different type of movement or interaction. The current state is dynamic, so testing a movement action directly makes sense.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To gain more observations for ACTION2, hoping to get closer to verification, and learn how the 'selected' objects move downwards.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows two primary entities (color 12 and color 9 blocks) which appear to be the 'player' or active blocks. They are centrally located and not up against any obvious barriers for downward movement, making it a good state to test ACTION2. ACTION5 has consistently had no effect, suggesting either it's not applicable in the current context or requires specific conditions we haven't met. We must prioritize gathering more data on unverified movement actions before attempting ACTION5 again after a forced setup movement, especially since we have no verified movement yet to guarantee a state change."
