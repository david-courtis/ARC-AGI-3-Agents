Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up, blocked by hard walls (Color 0) or the upper limit of the Color 7 play area."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: There is a green background, with a larger light-green area defined by a 48x48 shape at (8,8). There are various other blocks of different colors scattered, including the two blocks that moved. The game seems to have some UI elements at the top.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both located at column 40, moved one unit upwards. The color 12 block moved from row 48 to 47, and the color 9 block moved from row 50 to 49.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - The two active/selected blocks appear to be a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block. Their positions can vary.
  - ACTION4 consistently moves these two blocks one unit to the right.
  - ACTION5 might be a no-op or has conditions for effects that have not been met in any observed state.
