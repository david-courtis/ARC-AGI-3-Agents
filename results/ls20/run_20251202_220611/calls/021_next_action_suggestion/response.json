  ],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had no effect in the current state for three consecutive attempts. According to the rules, we must use a setup sequence of verified movement actions to reach a different position before retesting an action that previously had no effect. Since no actions are yet verified, we will use ACTION1 as it has a defined effect (moves the combined player entity up) and has been observed once. Moving the blocks to a new position gives ACTION5 a chance to potentially have an effect in a different context. This fulfills the requirement of trying ACTION5 in a new state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION5 in a new position (after moving up with ACTION1), we aim to determine if ACTION5's 'no effect' was context-dependent. This might reveal if ACTION5 requires the active blocks to be in a specific location or near a specific object to perform an action (e.g., interact, select, or rotate). This will provide more data points for ACTION5's behavior and help determine its true definition.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows the two active blocks (color 12 and color 9) in a specific central location. ACTION5 has consistently had no effect when executed at this position. This suggests that its function might be context-dependent, requiring a different position or interaction with other objects which are not present or applicable in the current state."
