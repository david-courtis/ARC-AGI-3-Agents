This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 primarily causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12, 8x2 and color 9, 8x6) to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate) within the play area, provided they are not at the bottom edge and there are no obstacles directly below them. In specific, previously observed contexts,ACTION2 can also trigger a complete game environment reset or level change, removing all current objects, changing the background, and introducing new sets of objects, including new 'player' entities.\n  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the left within the Color 7 play area. This action impacts UI elements based on interaction.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 is either a conditional right-move for the player entity or a game state reset. If it's a right-move, it's blocked by boundaries or internal obstacles when the conditions for movement are met. In the current state (player at top boundary), it has no visible effect, suggesting its conditions for visible effect are not met.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect on the player entity or environment.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - All objects from previous state: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Background color: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - New color 12 64x64 shape at (0,0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - New color 9 48x48 shape at (8,8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - New color 5 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - New color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block at row 0, col 0 (new background): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 4 64x64 block at (0,0) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 8x6 block at row 50, col 40 (new 'player' component): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 8x2 block at row 48, col 40 (new 'player' component): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 5 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,32) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,32) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (8, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION4 appears to require a specific instance or a 'selected' state for the color 12 and color 9 blocks to move right, not just their generic presence.\n  - It is now strongly indicated that ACTION4's 'move right' functionality is dependent on more than just the presence and position of generic color 12 and color 9 blocks. There's an unobserved condition such as block identity or 'selection' state.\n  - The 'game reset' behavior for ACTION4 is clearly linked to the previous game state (orange background) and does not occur in the green background state.\n  - ACTION4's 'move right' effect is not merely dependent on the presence and eligibility of color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks. An additional, unobserved condition (e.g., specific block ID or 'selection' state) is required.\n  - The 'game reset' effect for ACTION4 is confirmed to be contingent on a specific previous game state (orange background) and does not occur in the green background state.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently shown no effect and is the only action with 0/3 consistent observations. However, given its history of 'no effect', it's highly unlikely to observe an effect in the current state without a change in context. ACTION4 also had no effect. ACTION2 is at 0/3 consistent observations but has shown effects in the past including a 'game environment reset' or moving the player entity. Since its definition mentions a 'game environment reset or level change, removing all current objects, changing the background, and introducing new sets of objects', it's a high priority to verify. We should test ACTION2 to see if we can trigger its full functionality or at least get more consistent observations about its movement aspect. The current state is suitable for testing ACTION2 for movement, as the player entity is not at the bottom edge.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Verify if ACTION2 triggers a game reset or moves the player entities down. This will help us confirm its full functionality and distinguish between its two observed behaviors.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board features several objects, primarily the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks). The player entity is not at the bottom edge of the play area, making it a good state to test downward movement (ACTION2). There are no immediate obstacles below the player. ACTION4 and ACTION5 have been recently tested and resulted in 'no effect', indicating repeating them in the current context would be unproductive. ACTION3 is 2/3 consistent and could be tested, but ACTION2 has a more complex and critical unverified functionality."
