Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: VERIFIED - ACTION1 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up (decreasing their row position by 1), as long as they are not at the top edge of the play area and there are no immediate obstacles above them. This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 primarily causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12, 8x2 and color 9, 8x6) to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate) within the play area, provided they are not at the bottom edge and there are no obstacles directly below them. In specific, previously observed contexts,ACTION2 can also trigger a complete game environment reset or level change, removing all current objects, changing the background, and introducing new sets of objects, including new 'player' entities.
  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the left within the Color 7 play area. This action impacts UI elements based on interaction.
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 is either a conditional right-move for the player entity or a game state reset. If it's a right-move, it's blocked by boundaries or internal obstacles when the conditions for movement are met. In the current state (player at top boundary), it has no visible effect, suggesting its conditions for visible effect are not met.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect on the player entity or environment.

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION4 appears to require a specific instance or a 'selected' state for the color 12 and color 9 blocks to move right, not just their generic presence.
  - It is now strongly indicated that ACTION4's 'move right' functionality is dependent on more than just the presence and position of generic color 12 and color 9 blocks. There's an unobserved condition such as block identity or 'selection' state.
  - The 'game reset' behavior for ACTION4 is clearly linked to the previous game state (orange background) and does not occur in the green background state.
  - ACTION4's 'move right' effect is not merely dependent on the presence and eligibility of color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks. An additional, unobserved condition (e.g., specific block ID or 'selection' state) is required.
  - The 'game reset' effect for ACTION4 is confirmed to be contingent on a specific previous game state (orange background) and does not occur in the green background state.
