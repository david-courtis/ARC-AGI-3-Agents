  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently shown no effect in its previous attempts (2/2 no effect, 0/8 total attempts). The critical rule states that if an action had no effect, it should not be tested again in the same state. Therefore, a setup sequence is required to move the active blocks to a different position before re-testing ACTION5. Since ACTION4 is the most validated movement action with one consistent observation, using it twice will move the blocks to a new position, allowing for a re-test of ACTION5 in a different context. This strategy prioritizes re-testing an action that has had no effect, after changing the game state, to uncover its function if it is context-dependent.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the active blocks to a new position using ACTION4, we hope to find a context where ACTION5 might have an effect. This will help us understand its purpose (e.g., interaction with other objects, rotation, or selection change) or confirm that it truly has no effect in diverse game states. We also might gather more validation for ACTION4 as a reliable movement action.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows two active blocks (color 12 and color 9) which are movable by ACTION4. ACTION5 had no effect in this specific configuration. To explore ACTION5's functionality, a change in the active blocks' position, within the main play area (Color 7), is necessary."
