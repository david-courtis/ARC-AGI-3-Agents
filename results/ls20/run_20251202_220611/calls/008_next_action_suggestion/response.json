  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been observed yet, making it the highest priority to test to gain initial understanding of its effect. There are no recent 'no effect' attempts for any actions, so a setup sequence is not immediately required. Testing a new action is the most efficient way to proceed.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION4. This will complete the initial observation of all basic movement actions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows several distinct objects, and the previous actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3) have caused movement of specific rectangular blocks. There is ample space for the movement actions to be observed."
