Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 moves two specific, currently selected/active, rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block) one unit to the right. This action likely acts on 'selected' or 'active' objects as it consistently moves two specific blocks."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The game environment includes a light-green play area. Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved in previous actions. They are positioned within the play area, not at its right boundary.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 32, moved one unit to the right. The color 12 block moved from column 32 to 33, and the color 9 block moved from column 32 to 33. Their row positions remained unchanged.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game environment contains a light-green play area. Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved in previous actions. They are positioned within the play area, not at its right boundary. The 'objects before action' list shows the blocks at (48,40) and (50,40) respectively.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 40 (based on object list, but moved from 32 to 33 in previous observation - there is a discrepancy in the provided context for ACTION4) moved one unit to the right. The color 12 block moved from column 40 to 41, and the color 9 block moved from column 40 to 41. Their row positions remained unchanged. The previous observation stated column 32 to 33; this observation shows them moving from 40 to 41. The initial position from the environment understanding objects list (48,40) and (50,40) for the color 12 and 9 blocks is consistent with the 'objects before action' list. This means between the previous ACTION4 analysis and now, the blocks were moved back or set to (48,40) and (50,40) to be the 'before' state for this current observation.

  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - All objects from previous state: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Background color: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - New color 12 64x64 shape at (0,0): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - New color 9 48x48 shape at (8,8): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - New color 5 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - New color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,32): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION5 is a no-op action.
  - The 'player entity' is composed of a Color 12 (8x2) block and a Color 9 (8x6) block that move together.
  - Movement appears to be confined within the light-green play area (Color 7).
  - ACTION2 is not a simple movement action.
  - ACTION2 appears to be a major game state alteration, possibly a 'level reset' or 'level change' action.
