The environment reset from an orange background with a 'player entity' at (24,32) and (26,32) to a green background with a light-green play area. All objects from the 'before' state disappeared. Numerous new objects appeared, including the two primary 'player' blocks (color 12 and color 9) at (48,40) and (50,40), other colored blocks, and UI elements. This indicates ACTION4 also has a 'reset' or 'level change' function, similar to what was observed with ACTION2 in a previous turn.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION4, under certain circumstances, appears to trigger a complete game state reset or level change. This includes changing the background, removing all existing objects, and introducing a new set of objects in new positions. When this reset function is not triggered, ACTION4 moves two specific, currently selected/active, rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block) one unit to the right.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'before' state was a completely different game environment (orange background, different objects) compared to previous observations where ACTION4 caused simple rightward movement. This suggests a different game mode or a specific trigger condition (e.g., reaching a goal in the previous state, or a time limit) was met, causing ACTION4 to perform a 'reset' function instead of its usual 'move right' function. The 'player entity' from the previous orange screen (color 5 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,32) and color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,32)) has disappeared, and new 'player' blocks (color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40)) have appeared.",
