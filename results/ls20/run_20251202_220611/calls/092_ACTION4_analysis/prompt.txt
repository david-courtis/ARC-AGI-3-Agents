Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 either moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) one unit to the right, or it triggers a complete game state reset. Its effect is blocked if the player is at a boundary or if specific conditions for movement/reset are not met."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (7 total):
  [1] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area with various colored blocks, including a color 12 (8x2) block at (8,40) and a color 9 (8x6) block at (10,40). No objects appear to be selected or in a highlighted state. There are numerous other blocks and UI elements, all remaining static.
      Interpretation: ACTION4 had no visible effect on any objects or the environment. The state before and after the action is identical. The two active blocks (color 12 rectangular block at (8,40) and color 9 rectangular block at (10,40)) did not move right. This is the third consecutive observation where ACTION4 had no effect, and the second consecutive observation where it failed to cause a rightward movement.
  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area with various colored blocks, including a color 12 (8x2) block at (8,40) and a color 9 (8x6) block at (10,40). No objects appear to be selected or in a highlighted state. All numerous other blocks and UI elements remain static. The background is green, not orange, which discounts the reset condition.
      Interpretation: ACTION4 had no visible effect on any objects or the environment. The state before and after the action is identical. Neither the expected 'move right' of the player entity nor a game state reset occurred.
  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area with various colored blocks, including a color 12 (8x2) block at (8,40) and a color 9 (8x6) block at (10,40).

  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION4 appears to have more complex conditions for its 'move right' functionality than just presence of the color 12 and color 9 blocks and not being at a boundary. It might require specific instances of these blocks or a 'selected' state.
  - The 'player entity' blocks that can be moved by ACTION4 might be a different type of color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) block than the ones currently present in the 'objects before action' list. Or the game considers them 'not movable' in this state.
  - Further evidence that the simple presence of color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks is not sufficient for ACTION4 to cause a rightward movement. There must be an additional, unobservable condition for move right to occur, or these are not the 'player entity' that ACTION4 moves.
  - The 'game reset' behavior previously observed for ACTION4 is not triggered when the background is green.
  - ACTION4 appears to require a specific instance or a 'selected' state for the color 12 and color 9 blocks to move right, not just their generic presence.
