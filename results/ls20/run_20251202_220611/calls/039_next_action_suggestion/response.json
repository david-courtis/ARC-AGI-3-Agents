  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced 'no effect' in previous attempts, indicating either it's not active in the current state or its effect is context-dependent. The rule states that if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first. All movement actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) have 1/3 consistent observations and are suitable for a setup sequence. Moving the active blocks with ACTION1 twice will change their position and create a new context to re-test ACTION5. This strategy aims to discover if ACTION5 is effective in a different location or configuration of the active blocks. Since no movement actions are fully verified, we pick one of them to move. We choose ACTION1 to move the blocks up, as all movement actions are equally unverified but have shown effects.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a change in the active blocks' position, we aim to uncover if ACTION5's effect is dependent on location or relative position to other objects. We hope to observe an actual effect for ACTION5 this time, verify its function, or at least gather more data towards verifying that it is a no-op.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows two key active blocks (color 12 and color 9) which move together. ACTION5 has had no effect in previous tests. The environment includes various static blocks and outlined areas that might become relevant for ACTION5 if it involves interaction or placement. The current position of the active blocks might not be conducive for ACTION5's intended purpose, given its history of no effect."
