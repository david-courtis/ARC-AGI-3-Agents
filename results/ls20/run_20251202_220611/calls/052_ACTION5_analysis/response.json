There are no observed conditions under which it produces a change. It is not an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position' action as previously hypothesized, because no such interaction/selection/rotation has ever been observed.",

No environmental conditions (like objects being at an edge or against an obstacle, or specific objects being selected) have been observed that trigger a different outcome. There are no highlighted or selected objects. This consistent lack of effect strongly suggests that the action is a no-op.",
