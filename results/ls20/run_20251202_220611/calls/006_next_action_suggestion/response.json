  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 and ACTION4 are completely unexplored, making them the highest priority for testing. Since there are no verified actions yet, we cannot perform a setup sequence. Both ACTION1 and ACTION2 have been attempted once and still need more validation, but testing completely unknown actions is more critical at this stage to quickly map out the game mechanics. Current state seems fine for testing movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION3 (Move LEFT), whether it moves a specific object or the entire player, and the magnitude of the movement. This will help understand horizontal movement mechanics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game board shows several rectangular blocks of different colors. Two distinct groups of blocks have been identified and moved by ACTION1 and ACTION2, suggesting the game might involve manipulating these blocks. The current position does not seem to constrain horizontal movement severely, making it a good state to test ACTION3."
