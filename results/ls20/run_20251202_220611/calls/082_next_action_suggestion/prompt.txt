Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: VERIFIED - ACTION1 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up (decreasing their row position by 1), as long as they are not at the top edge of the play area and there are no immediate obstacles above them. This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 primarily causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12, 8x2 and color 9, 8x6) to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate) within the play area, provided they are not at the bottom edge and there are no obstacles directly below them. In specific, previously observed contexts,ACTION2 can also trigger a complete game environment reset or level change, removing all current objects, changing the background, and introducing new sets of objects, including new 'player' entities.
  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the left within the Color 7 play area. This action impacts UI elements based on interaction.
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either causes a complete game state reset or attempts to move the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the right. This rightward movement is blocked by walls/boundaries.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect on the player entity or environment.

Recent Observations:
  - The game has a 'reset' or 'level advance' mechanism that can be triggered by actions, not just through a dedicated 'reset' action.
  - ACTION4 can behave as a 'game reset/level change' action under specific, currently unknown, contexts.
  - The 'player' blocks (color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6)) are consistent across normal movement actions, but when a reset/level change occurs, their type might be swapped or newly created with varied positions.
  - ACTION2 has two distinct behaviors: a 'move down' behavior for two specific blocks, and a 'game reset/level change' behavior. The specific conditions that trigger the 'game reset/level change' are still unknown, but seems to occur when the game environment is in a non-standard state (e.g. orange background).
  - The 'move down' behavior of ACTION2 is consistent across multiple observations now.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1
