ACTION4: ACTION4 either causes a complete game state reset or attempts to move the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the right. This rightward movement is blocked by walls/boundaries.
  Reason: Previous observations confirmed ACTION4 can move the player right. The current observation shows ACTION4 having no effect, which aligns with the player being at the top boundary and thus unable to move, assuming a rightward movement is also blocked by Color 0 boundary or by being stuck against Color 0 more generally.
