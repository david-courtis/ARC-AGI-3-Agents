  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently shown no effect and is believed to be a no-op action. The primary goal is to gather more verification for the remaining actions. ACTION1 has only 1/3 consistent observations and needs more testing to become verified. Since ACTION1 has not had a recent 'no effect' result, we can test it directly without a setup sequence to make progress on its verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validation of ACTION1's effect (moving the combined player entity up) and increasing its consistency count towards verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state appears suitable for testing directional movement actions. The active blocks are not at the top boundary, so ACTION1 should have an observable effect."
