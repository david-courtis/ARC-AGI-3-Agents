  "reasoning": "All actions are unknown. It is best to start by testing a basic movement action like ACTION1 (Move UP) to understand if movement is possible and what its effect is. The current position appears to be in an open area, so there are no obvious obstacles preventing movement in any direction.",
  "expected_information_gain": "This will tell us what ACTION1 does (move up, no effect, or something else) and provide the first piece of information about basic game mechanics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The agent (black L-shape with purple dot) is located near the bottom left of a large green area. There are several other colored blocks on the screen, a line of red dots at the top, and some orange squares at the top right. We are not currently against any obvious walls or obstacles that would prevent movement. The current state seems good for testing basic movement."
