  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect, and we've tried it many times recently. Therefore, according to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a new position before retrying ACTION5. Additionally, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 are all still unverified. Since ACTION1 is the only verified movement action, we should use it to change the position meaningfully. Moving up twice with ACTION1 will move the active blocks away from the potential boundary at the top of the play area and away from the other blocks. This creates a more open space to test other actions. Between ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4, ACTION2 is next in line for validation (1/3 consistent observations). By moving up first, we create more space to observe the downward movement without immediately hitting a boundary or other objects, which might interfere with clear observation. This will allow us to gather more data points for ACTION2's consistency. This prioritizes getting more validation points for pending actions that are not ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "This will help us validate ACTION2 further by observing its effect in a new position, potentially getting closer to the 3 consistent observations needed for verification. Moving to a new location also gives a fresh context for testing, making it more likely to reveal new aspects of actions or confirm existing ones without immediate boundary interference.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state has the active blocks at a certain position. While not directly against a boundary for movement right or down, the top boundary is relatively close. The main goal is to introduce a significant change in position to enable new observations, especially for actions that previously had no effect or are less certain."
