Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:
"ACTION3 causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) to move one unit to the left."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The game environment includes a light-green play area. Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved upwards with ACTION1 and downwards with ACTION2. They are positioned within the play area, not at its left boundary.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 40, moved one unit to the left. The color 12 block moved from column 40 to 39, and the color 9 block moved from column 40 to 39. Their row positions remained unchanged.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - The two active/selected blocks appear to be a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block. Their positions can vary.
  - ACTION4 consistently moves these two blocks one unit to the right.
  - ACTION5 might be a no-op or has conditions for effects that have not been met in any observed state.
  - The two active/selected blocks (color 12 and color 9) consistently move together.
