Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4, under certain circumstances, appears to trigger a complete game state reset or level change. This includes changing the background, removing all existing objects, and introducing a new set of objects in new positions. When this reset function is not triggered, ACTION4 moves two specific, currently selected/active, rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block) one unit to the right."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The game environment includes a light-green play area. Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved in previous actions. They are positioned within the play area, not at its right boundary.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 32, moved one unit to the right. The color 12 block moved from column 32 to 33, and the color 9 block moved from column 32 to 33. Their row positions remained unchanged.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game environment contains a light-green play area. Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved in previous actions. They are positioned within the play area, not at its right boundary. The 'objects before action' list shows the blocks at (48,40) and (50,40) respectively.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 40 (based on object list, but moved from 32 to 33 in previous observation - there is a discrepancy in the provided context for ACTION4) moved one unit to the right. The color 12 block moved from column 40 to 41, and the color 9 block moved from column 40 to 41. Their row positions remained unchanged. The previous observation stated column 32 to 33; this observation shows them moving from 40 to 41. The initial position from the environment understanding objects list (48,40) and (50,40) for the color 12 and 9 blocks is consistent with the 'objects before action' list. This means between the previous ACTION4 analysis and now, the blocks were moved back or set to (48,40) and (50,40) to be the 'before' state for this current observation.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game environment was reset from a singular orange screen with a small 'player entity' to a green background with a complex light-green play area containing numerous static and dynamic objects. This is a complete game state overhaul.
      Interpretation: The game state completely changed. The environment reset from an orange background with a 'player entity' at (24,32) and (26,32) to a green background with a light-green play area. All objects from the 'before' state disappeared. Numerous new objects appeared, including the two primary 'player' blocks (color 12 and color 9) at (48,40) and (50,40), other colored blocks, and UI elements. This indicates ACTION4 also has a 'reset' or 'level change' function, similar to what was observed with ACTION2 in a previous turn.

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION2 is not a simple movement action.
  - ACTION2 appears to be a major game state alteration, possibly a 'level reset' or 'level change' action.
  - The game has a 'reset' or 'level advance' mechanism that can be triggered by actions, not just through a dedicated 'reset' action.
  - ACTION4 can behave as a 'game reset/level change' action under specific, currently unknown, contexts.
  - The 'player' blocks (color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6)) are consistent across normal movement actions, but when a reset/level change occurs, their type might be swapped or newly created with varied positions.
