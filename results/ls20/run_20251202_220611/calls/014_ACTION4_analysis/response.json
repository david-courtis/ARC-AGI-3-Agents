  "interpretation": "Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 40 (based on object list, but moved from 32 to 33 in previous observation - there is a discrepancy in the provided context for ACTION4) moved one unit to the right. The color 12 block moved from column 40 to 41, and the color 9 block moved from column 40 to 41. Their row positions remained unchanged. The previous observation stated column 32 to 33; this observation shows them moving from 40 to 41. The initial position from the environment understanding objects list (48,40) and (50,40) for the color 12 and 9 blocks is consistent with the 'objects before action' list. This means between the previous ACTION4 analysis and now, the blocks were moved back or set to (48,40) and (50,40) to be the 'before' state for this current observation.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION4 moves two specific, currently selected/active, rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block) one unit to the right. This action likely acts on 'selected' or 'active' objects as it consistently moves two specific blocks.",

These are the same two blocks that moved in previous actions. They are positioned within the play area, not at its right boundary. The 'objects before action' list shows the blocks at (48,40) and (50,40) respectively.",
