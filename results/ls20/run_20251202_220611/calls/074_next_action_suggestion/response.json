  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently shown no effect recently and is largely unverified; it needs a change in the player's position to be re-evaluated. ACTION2, while having 3/8 attempts, has only 0/3 consistent observations and its definition indicates a game reset. ACTION3 is close to being verified with 2/3 consistent observations. However, ACTION4, also having 0/3 consistent observations, needs more data. Given the recent resets caused by both ACTION2 and ACTION4, it's strategic to try ACTION4 again after a series of verified moves to see if we can trigger its non-reset behavior (moving the blocks to the right). We will use ACTION1, which is VERIFIED, to move the player entity away from its current position and then test ACTION4. By moving multiple times, we ensure a significant change in position which might influence the behavior of ACTION4. This gives us a better chance to differentiate between ACTION4's potential movement effect and its reset effect, or to solidify its reset definition.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to gain more observations for ACTION4 to either verify its 'game reset' definition or to identify consistent conditions under which it acts as a 'move right' action. By applying it in a new position distinct from previous reset-triggering states, we might obtain observations that do not result in a full game reset, giving crucial insight into its dual nature.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board features several blocks, including the two player-controlled blocks (Color 12 and 9). The current position of these blocks is (48,40) and (50,40) respectively. There are no immediate obstacles above them, making ACTION1 a viable setup move. The board state appears ready for general exploration, but specific actions like ACTION5 (no effect) and potentially ACTION4 (reset in some cases) might require a different player position to resolve their ambiguity."
