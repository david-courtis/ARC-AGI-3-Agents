Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: VERIFIED - ACTION1 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up (decreasing their row position by 1), as long as they are not at the top edge of the play area and there are no immediate obstacles above them. This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 primarily causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12, 8x2 and color 9, 8x6) to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate) within the play area, provided they are not at the bottom edge and there are no obstacles directly below them. In specific, previously observed contexts,ACTION2 can also trigger a complete game environment reset or level change, removing all current objects, changing the background, and introducing new sets of objects, including new 'player' entities.
  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the left within the Color 7 play area. This action impacts UI elements based on interaction.
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) one unit to the right, or it triggers a complete game state reset. Rightward movement is blocked by walls/boundaries or the absence of the 'player entity'. The conditions for triggering a game reset are currently unknown but seem to be related to the overall state of the game environment (e.g., orange background). If the player entity is not present, or if it is at a boundary, or if some other unknown condition is not met, the action may have no effect.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect on the player entity or environment.

Recent Observations:
  - The 'move down' behavior of ACTION2 is consistent across multiple observations now.
  - ACTION4 appears to have more complex conditions for its 'move right' functionality than just presence of the color 12 and color 9 blocks and not being at a boundary. It might require specific instances of these blocks or a 'selected' state.
  - The 'player entity' blocks that can be moved by ACTION4 might be a different type of color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) block than the ones currently present in the 'objects before action' list. Or the game considers them 'not movable' in this state.
  - Further evidence that the simple presence of color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks is not sufficient for ACTION4 to cause a rightward movement. There must be an additional, unobservable condition for move right to occur, or these are not the 'player entity' that ACTION4 moves.
  - The 'game reset' behavior previously observed for ACTION4 is not triggered when the background is green.
