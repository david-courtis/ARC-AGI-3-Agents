  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has had multiple 'no-effect' observations recently and thus, per the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a new position before retesting it. ACTION1 is the only currently VERIFIED movement action and will move the player entity up. Moving up creates a new state from which to test ACTION4, and potentially moves the player entity away from a boundary or into a context where ACTION4 might have its intended 'move right' effect, or even trigger a game reset under different conditions. We also need more data points to understand the conditions under which ACTION4 causes a game reset vs. moving right.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to gain more consistent observations for ACTION4. Specifically, we want to see if moving to a new position (one unit up) allows ACTION4 to reveal its 'move right' behavior or whether it triggers a game reset under these new conditions. This will help us clarify the definition of ACTION4 and contribute to its verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows a green background with multiple block entities, including the main 'player' entities (color 12 and 9). The player entities are currently positioned such that they could potentially move right if the conditions for ACTION4's movement are met. However, since previous attempts had no effect, simply re-trying ACTION4 in this exact state is unproductive. Moving up using ACTION1 changes the player's position, creating a new test context for ACTION4. There are no obstructions immediately above the player for ACTION1."
