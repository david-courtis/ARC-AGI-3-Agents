ACTION4: ACTION4 is either a conditional right-move for the player entity or a game state reset. If it's a right-move, it's blocked by boundaries or internal obstacles when the conditions for movement are met. In the current state (player at top boundary), it has no visible effect, suggesting its conditions for visible effect are not met.
  Reason: Repeated observation shows ACTION4 having no effect. This solidifies previous thoughts that it's either a conditional right-move (currently blocked or condition not met) or a game reset if certain prior conditions were met (like an orange background, which is not present here). It is not a simple unconditional right-move otherwise we'd expect some movement or a clearer block.
