Do they change values or represent quantifiable game state, and how do they relate to player actions or scores?\n- What action, if any, allows the player to move right?\n- Is there any action for downward movement of the player entity?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS:\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up (decreasing their row position by 1), as long as they are not at the top edge of the play area and there are no immediate obstacles above them. This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 primarily causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12, 8x2 and color 9, 8x6) to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate) within the play area, provided they are not at the bottom edge and there are no obstacles directly below them. In specific, previously observed contexts,ACTION2 can also trigger a complete game environment reset or level change, removing all current objects, changing the background, and introducing new sets of objects, including new 'player' entities.\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the left within the Color 7 play area. This action impacts UI elements based on interaction.\"\n  ACTION4: \"ACTION4 either moves a specific, possibly 'selected', combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) one unit to the right, or it triggers a complete game state reset. The move right effect is conditional on the specific player entity being 'active' or 'selected', not at a boundary or facing an obstacle. The game state reset effect occurs when the previous state involved an orange background. The simple presence of color 12 and color 9 blocks at an eligible location is not sufficient for rightward movement.\"\n  ACTION5: \"ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect on the player entity or environment.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n\nIf a movement action had NO EFFECT, the most likely reason is a WALL or BOUNDARY.\nLook carefully at the edges and any patterns that might indicate walls.\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf you have new questions to investigate, list them.\n\nIMPORTANT - ACTION UPDATE SUGGESTIONS:\nBased on your environment understanding (especially breakthroughs about walls, boundaries, etc.),\nsuggest updates to action definitions. Keep definitions SIMPLE and CONCEPTUAL, e.g.:\n- \"moves the player up, blocked by grey walls\"\n- \"moves right within the bounded play area\"\n- \"interacts with adjacent objects\"\nDo NOT suggest an update if the current definition is already accurate."
