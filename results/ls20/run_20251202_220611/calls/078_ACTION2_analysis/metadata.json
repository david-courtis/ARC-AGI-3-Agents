  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION2.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION2:\n\"ACTION2 causes a complete reset or level change of the game environment. All existing objects are removed, the background color changes, and a new set of objects is introduced, potentially indicating a new level or game state.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT\n      Context: The game environment contains a prominent light-green play area. Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved upwards with ACTION1, now having returned to a lower position relative to the play area.\n      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both located at column 40, moved one unit downwards. The color 12 block moved from row 40 to 41, and the color 9 block moved from row 42 to 43. This is the opposite of ACTION1.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area. The two active blocks (color 12 and color 9) are positioned within this area, not at its bottom boundary. There are other static blocks and UI elements.\n      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 48, moved one unit downwards. The color 12 block moved from row 24 to 25, and the color 9 block moved from row 26 to 27. Their column positions remained unchanged.\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: The game environment was reset. The background changed from green to orange. All previous static and dynamic objects were removed, and new objects were created, including a new 'player entity' in the center.\n      Interpretation: The game state completely changed. All objects from the previous frame disappeared, including the `player entity` (a color 12 and color 9 block). The green background was replaced with an orange background (color 4). The `top_ui` elements (Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56) and Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60)) also disappeared. New objects appeared: a color 12 64x64 shape at (0,0) (replacing the previous color 4 64x64 shape), a color 9 48x48 shape at (8,8) (replacing the previous color 3 48x48 shape), and a new light-blue (color 5) block at (24,32) and purple (color 9) block at (26,32), which seem to form a new 'player entity'. This action appears to be a 'restart' or 'level change' action, not a simple movement.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - All objects from previous state: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Background color: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - New color 12 64x64 shape at (0,0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - New color 9 48x48 shape at (8,8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - New color 5 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - New color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 64x64 block at row 0, col 0 (new background): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 4 64x64 block at (0,0) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 8x6 block at row 50, col 40 (new 'player' component): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 8x2 block at row 48, col 40 (new 'player' component): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 5 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,32) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,32) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 is not a simple movement action.\n  - ACTION2 appears to be a major game state alteration, possibly a 'level reset' or 'level change' action.\n  - The game has a 'reset' or 'level advance' mechanism that can be triggered by actions, not just through a dedicated 'reset' action.\n  - ACTION4 can behave as a 'game reset/level change' action under specific, currently unknown, contexts.\n  - The 'player' blocks (color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6)) are consistent across normal movement actions, but when a reset/level change occurs, their type might be swapped or newly created with varied positions.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed.

Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved upwards with ACTION1, now having returned to a lower position relative to the play area.\n      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both located at column 40, moved one unit downwards. The color 12 block moved from row 40 to 41, and the color 9 block moved from row 42 to 43. This is the opposite of ACTION1.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area. The two active blocks (color 12 and color 9) are positioned within this area, not at its bottom boundary. There are other static blocks and UI elements.\n      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 48, moved one unit downwards. The color 12 block moved from row 24 to 25, and the color 9 block moved from row 26 to 27. Their column positions remained unchanged.\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: The game environment was reset. The background changed from green to orange. All previous static and dynamic objects were removed, and new objects were created, including a new 'player entity' in the center.\n      Interpretation: The game state completely changed. All objects from the previous frame disappeared, including the `player entity` (a color 12 and color 9 block). The green background was replaced with an orange background (color 4). The `top_ui` elements (Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 56) and Color 8 rectangular block (2x2) at (1, 60)) also disappeared. New objects appeared: a color 12 64x64 shape at (0,0) (replacing the previous color 4 64x64 shape), a color 9 48x48 shape at (8,8) (replacing the previous color 3 48x48 shape), and a new light-blue (color 5) block at (24,32) and purple (color 9) block at (26,32), which seem to form a new 'player entity'.

In specific, previously observed contexts,ACTION2 can also trigger a complete game environment reset or level change, removing all current objects, changing the background, and introducing new sets of objects, including new 'player' entities.",
