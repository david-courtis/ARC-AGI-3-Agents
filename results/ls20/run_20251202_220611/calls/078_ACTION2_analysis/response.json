  "interpretation": "Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 40, moved one unit downwards. The color 12 block moved from row 8 to 9, and the color 9 block moved from row 10 to 11. Their column positions remained unchanged. This is consistent with previous observations of ACTION2 causing downward movement.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION2 primarily causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12, 8x2 and color 9, 8x6) to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate) within the play area, provided they are not at the bottom edge and there are no obstacles directly below them. In specific, previously observed contexts,ACTION2 can also trigger a complete game environment reset or level change, removing all current objects, changing the background, and introducing new sets of objects, including new 'player' entities.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The observed blocks were not at the bottom edge of the play area and there were no apparent obstacles immediately below them. This context allowed for a single unit downward movement. This specific behavior 'move down' has been observed before for ACTION2. The current environment is the standard green background with light-green play area.",

    "ACTION2 has two distinct behaviors: a 'move down' behavior for two specific blocks, and a 'game reset/level change' behavior. The specific conditions that trigger the 'game reset/level change' are still unknown, but seems to occur when the game environment is in a non-standard state (e.g. orange background).",
