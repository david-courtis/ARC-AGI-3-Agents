ACTION4: ACTION4 either moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) one unit to the right, or it triggers a complete game state reset. Rightward movement is blocked by walls/boundaries or the absence of the 'player entity'. The conditions for triggering a game reset are currently unknown but seem to be related to the overall state of the game environment (e.g., orange background). If the player entity is not present, or if it is at a boundary, or if some other unknown condition is not met, the action may have no effect.
  Reason: Previous observations and this one show ACTION4 having no effect repeatedly when the player is against the top boundary, and no rightward movement occurs. This further indicates that it's not a simple movement action, but either a conditional right-move or a reset, whose conditions were not met here.
