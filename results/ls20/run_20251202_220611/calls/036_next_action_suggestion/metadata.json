    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced 'NO EFFECT' in multiple attempts, indicating that either its effect is conditional or the current position is not suitable for its execution. To strategically test ACTION5 and fulfill the 'CRITICAL RULE' of not repeating a no-effect action in the same state, we must first change the game state. Since all movement actions (ACTION1 through ACTION4) are only 1/3 consistent, we prioritize a movement that will move the active objects to a new position. Given the current position of the active objects (color 12 at (40,48) and color 9 at (42,48)), moving them 'UP' (ACTION1) seems like a good initial setup to vary the testing conditions for ACTION5. There are no 'VERIFIED ACTIONS' yet, so any movement action will need further validation. We specifically pick ACTION1 to confirm its definition after moving the active blocks to a distinct position.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By executing a setup sequence involving a movement action (ACTION1) and then attempting ACTION5 again, we hope to either finally observe an effect from ACTION5 in a different position, or gather more evidence that ACTION5 may be a no-op or require a very specific context not yet encountered. We will also gain further validation for ACTION1's behavior.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current state has the active objects (color 12 and color 9) at (40,48) and (42,48) respectively. ACTION5 has shown no effect from this general region. We need to move these objects to a new position to continue exploring ACTION5's behavior and to further validate movement actions."
