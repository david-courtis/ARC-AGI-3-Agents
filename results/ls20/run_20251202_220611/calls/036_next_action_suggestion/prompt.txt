Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up, blocked by hard walls (Color 0) or the upper limit of the Color 7 play area.
  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes the selected objects, if movable, to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate).
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) to move one unit to the left.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves two specific, currently selected/active, rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block) one unit to the right. This action likely acts on 'selected' or 'active' objects as it consistently moves two specific blocks.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 attempts to move the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) upwards, but its effect is consistently blocked by hard walls (Color 0) or the upper limit of the Color 7 play area.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - The two active/selected blocks appear to be a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block. Their positions can vary.
  - ACTION4 consistently moves these two blocks one unit to the right.
  - ACTION5 might be a no-op or has conditions for effects that have not been met in any observed state.
  - The two active/selected blocks (color 12 and color 9) consistently move together.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5
