  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced 'no effect' in previous attempts. According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first before trying it again. Since ACTION4 and ACTION1 have shown consistent effects of moving the active blocks, they are suitable for a setup sequence. Moving the active blocks multiple times with ACTION4 and then with ACTION1 will significantly change their position and context, providing a new environment to test ACTION5. This strategy aims to discover if ACTION5 is context-dependent or if its effect is currently blocked.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We want to determine if ACTION5 is a no-op or if it has a conditional effect that requires a specific context. By moving the active blocks to a new position, we hope to either observe an effect or confirm that it consistently has no effect regardless of the position.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has the active blocks (color 12 and 9) in a specific position, which has repeatedly led to ACTION5 having no visible effect. To efficiently explore ACTION5's behavior, we must change the game state. The current position is not ideal for testing ACTION5 without modification. We have room to move the active blocks significantly using known movement actions."
