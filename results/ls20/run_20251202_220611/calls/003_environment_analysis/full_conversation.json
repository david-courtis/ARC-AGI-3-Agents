BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay."

Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-55], cols [2-47]\n\nObject-level changes: MOVED: 2 objects\n  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved up\n  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved up\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBorder: Unknown or none detected\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\nNone yet\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\nNone yet\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS:\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 causes two specific blocks (one 8x2 color 12 and one 8x6 color 9) to move 1 unit up (decrease row/y position). It's possible these two blocks are a single 'player' object.\"\n  ACTION2: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION3: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n\nIf a movement action had NO EFFECT, the most likely reason is a WALL or BOUNDARY.\nLook carefully at the edges and any patterns that might indicate walls.\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf you have new questions to investigate, list them.\n\nIMPORTANT - ACTION UPDATE SUGGESTIONS:\nBased on your environment understanding (especially breakthroughs about walls, boundaries, etc.),\nsuggest updates to action definitions. Keep definitions SIMPLE and CONCEPTUAL, e.g.:\n- \"moves the player up, blocked by grey walls\"\n- \"moves right within the bounded play area\"\n- \"interacts with adjacent objects\"\nDo NOT suggest an update if the current definition is already accurate."
