  "new_definition": "ACTION4 either moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) one unit to the right, or it triggers a complete game state reset. Rightward movement appears to be blocked by walls/boundaries or the absence of a SPECIFIC 'player entity' instance (not just any color 12 and color 9 blocks). The conditions for triggering a game reset are currently unknown but seem to be related to the overall state of the game environment (e.g., orange background). If the correct 'player entity' is not present in a movable state, or if it is at a boundary, or if some other unknown condition is not met, the action may have no effect.",

Despite their presence and not being at the rightmost boundary, these blocks did not move. This strongly suggests that a simple presence of any color 12 and color 9 blocks is not sufficient for ACTION4 to cause movement. There must be an additional, unobservable condition for move right to occur, or these are not the 'player entity' that ACTION4 moves in this context. The game state was also not in the 'orange background' state, thus not triggering the reset condition.",
