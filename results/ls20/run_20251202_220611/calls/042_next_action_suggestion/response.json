  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no visible effect in multiple attempts, including 3 in the last 10 actions. The critical rule states that if an action had no effect recently, we must use a setup sequence to move first. Since no actions are yet verified, I must use one of the actions with partial verification. ACTION4 has shown a consistent effect of moving the two active blocks to the right. By moving the blocks significantly to a new position using ACTION4, we can re-test ACTION5 in a different context, hoping to uncover its conditions for activation or confirm it's a no-op across varied positions. We are aiming to move the combined block to a different 'quadrant' or area of the play space to see if this changes the outcome of ACTION5. I've chosen three ACTION4s to ensure a significant positional change.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 in a new position, we aim to discover if its lack of effect is due to specific contextual requirements (e.g., proximity to certain objects, or boundary conditions) or if it truly is a no-operation. If it continues to have no effect after a significant move, it strengthens the hypothesis that it's a no-op or has very specific and currently unmet activation conditions. If it does show an effect, we will begin to define its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows the combined Color 12 and Color 9 blocks in a central-left position. Previous attempts to use ACTION5 here have yielded no results. To effectively test ACTION5, we need to change the environment for the active blocks. Moving them to the right will place them in a different region of the playable area, which might influence ACTION5's outcome."
