Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 either causes a complete game state reset or attempts to move the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the right. This rightward movement is blocked by walls/boundaries."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (4 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game environment contains a light-green play area. Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved in previous actions. They are positioned within the play area, not at its right boundary. The 'objects before action' list shows the blocks at (48,40) and (50,40) respectively.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 40 (based on object list, but moved from 32 to 33 in previous observation - there is a discrepancy in the provided context for ACTION4) moved one unit to the right. The color 12 block moved from column 40 to 41, and the color 9 block moved from column 40 to 41. Their row positions remained unchanged. The previous observation stated column 32 to 33; this observation shows them moving from 40 to 41. The initial position from the environment understanding objects list (48,40) and (50,40) for the color 12 and 9 blocks is consistent with the 'objects before action' list. This means between the previous ACTION4 analysis and now, the blocks were moved back or set to (48,40) and (50,40) to be the 'before' state for this current observation.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game environment was reset from a singular orange screen with a small 'player entity' to a green background with a complex light-green play area containing numerous static and dynamic objects. This is a complete game state overhaul.
      Interpretation: The game state completely changed. The environment reset from an orange background with a 'player entity' at (24,32) and (26,32) to a green background with a light-green play area. All objects from the 'before' state disappeared. Numerous new objects appeared, including the two primary 'player' blocks (color 12 and color 9) at (48,40) and (50,40), other colored blocks, and UI elements. This indicates ACTION4 also has a 'reset' or 'level change' function, similar to what was observed with ACTION2 in a previous turn.
  [3] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area with various colored blocks, but specifically, the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks that normally move with ACTION4 are not among the listed 'objects before action' at coordinates that would enable a 'move right' effect. There are numerous other blocks and UI elements, all remaining static.
      Interpretation: ACTION4 had no visible effect on any objects or the environment. The state before and after the action is identical.

Recent Observations:
  - The game has a 'reset' or 'level advance' mechanism that can be triggered by actions, not just through a dedicated 'reset' action.
  - ACTION4 can behave as a 'game reset/level change' action under specific, currently unknown, contexts.
  - The 'player' blocks (color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6)) are consistent across normal movement actions, but when a reset/level change occurs, their type might be swapped or newly created with varied positions.
  - ACTION2 has two distinct behaviors: a 'move down' behavior for two specific blocks, and a 'game reset/level change' behavior. The specific conditions that trigger the 'game reset/level change' are still unknown, but seems to occur when the game environment is in a non-standard state (e.g. orange background).
  - The 'move down' behavior of ACTION2 is consistent across multiple observations now.
