ACTION4: ACTION4 either moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) one unit to the right, or it triggers a complete game state reset. Its effect is blocked if the player is at a boundary or if specific conditions for movement/reset are not met.
  Reason: Repeated observation of ACTION4 having no effect while the player is at the top boundary, combined with the previous understanding that it can be a conditional right-move or a reset, suggests that its conditions for effect are not met in the current 'blocked by boundary' state.
