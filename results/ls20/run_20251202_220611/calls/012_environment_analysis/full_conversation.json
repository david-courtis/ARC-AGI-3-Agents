BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay."

The outermost green (Color 3) appears to be empty space.\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - Objects seem to move within the boundaries of the 'Color 7' play area.\n  - The two moving blocks are constrained to move together in a vertical direction (up in this case).\nIdentified objects:\n  - Play Area Background: Color 7 (darker green) Large rectangular area (Role: Playable area/background)\n  - Player Block 1 (top of combined block): Color 12 (cyan) Rectangular block (8x2) (Role: Part of a player-controlled entity or an interactive object)\n  - Player Block 2 (bottom of combined block): Color 9 (purple) Rectangular block (8x6) (Role: Part of a player-controlled entity or an interactive object)\n  - Small red dots: Color 8 (red) A horizontal line of small square dots (Role: Score/Health/Indicator for top UI)\n  - Small orange squares: Color 10 (orange) Two small squares (Role: Score/Health/Indicator for top UI)\n  - Bottom grey line: Color 5 (grey) Horizontal line of small square dots/pixels (Role: Possible score/progress indicator or boundary)\n  - Yellow/Black block: Color 10 (yellow) and Color 0 (black) Interlocking L-shape of color 10 with a black square and another black L-shape below it. Overall somewhat blocky/figure-like. (Role: Obstacle or another interactive object)\n  - Small Black/Purple block: Color 0 (black) and Color 9 (purple) Small L-shape of black with a single purple pixel attached. (Role: Obstacle or collectible)\n  - Bottom-left black block: Color 0 (black) and Color 9 (purple) L-shaped black block with a purple corner (Role: Obstacle or decoration)\nSpatial structure: A central large rectangular play area (Color 7) surrounded by a lighter green 'background' (Color 3). There are seemingly static objects within this play area, and distinct UI elements at the top and bottom of the frame.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Identified a clear distinction between the outermost 'empty' background (Color 3) and an inner playable background (Color 7). This suggests the Color 7 area acts as a primary boundary for object movement.\n- The two moving blocks (Color 12 and Color 9) appear to constitute a single movable entity, possibly the 'player' based on their coordinated movement.\n- Identified several non-moving, distinct objects that likely serve as obstacles, collectibles, or other gameplay elements.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What defines the exact boundaries of the Color 7 play area regarding the Color 0 'black' areas and Color 3?\n- Do the black areas around the Color 7 play area represent walls or simply non-playable regions?\n- What are the roles of the various static objects (yellow/black block, small black/purple block, bottom-left black/purple block)?\n- Are there any other interactive elements or objects not yet identified?\n- Are the top red and orange dots and bottom grey dots part of a score, health, or level indicator?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS:\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 causes a combined entity (two blocks, one Color 12 8x2 and one Color 9 8x6) to move 1 unit up within the defined play area.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 causes the selected objects, if movable, to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate).\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) to move one unit to the left.\"\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION5: \"ACTION5 appears to have no visible effect when executed in the current game state.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n\nIf a movement action had NO EFFECT, the most likely reason is a WALL or BOUNDARY.\nLook carefully at the edges and any patterns that might indicate walls.\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf you have new questions to investigate, list them.\n\nIMPORTANT - ACTION UPDATE SUGGESTIONS:\nBased on your environment understanding (especially breakthroughs about walls, boundaries, etc.),\nsuggest updates to action definitions. Keep definitions SIMPLE and CONCEPTUAL, e.g.:\n- \"moves the player up, blocked by grey walls\"\n- \"moves right within the bounded play area\"\n- \"interacts with adjacent objects\"\nDo NOT suggest an update if the current definition is already accurate."
