- Objects seem to move within the boundaries of the 'Color 7' play area.
- The two moving blocks are constrained to move together in a vertical direction.
- Movement of the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) is blocked by the top edge of the Color 7 play area.
- The black (Color 0) areas appear to be hard walls/boundaries that prevent movement.
