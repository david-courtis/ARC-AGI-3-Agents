ACTION1: ACTION1 moves the combined entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up, blocked by the top boundary of the Color 7 play area (which is represented by Color 0 or the edge of Color 7 against Color 3).
  Reason: The recent ACTION5, which caused no visible effect, indicates the player entity attempted to move further up but was blocked. This suggests the top edge of the playable area (Color 7/Color 0) acts as a wall for ACTION1.
