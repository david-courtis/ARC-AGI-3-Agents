  "new_definition": "ACTION4 either moves a specific, possibly 'selected', combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) one unit to the right, or it triggers a complete game state reset. The move right effect is conditional on the specific player entity being 'active' or 'selected', not at a boundary or facing an obstacle. The game state reset effect occurs when the previous state involved an orange background. The simple presence of color 12 and color 9 blocks at an eligible location is not sufficient for rightward movement.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'objects before action' list explicitly identifies the color 12 (8x2) block at (8,40) and the color 9 (8x6) block at (10,40). Despite their presence and not being at the rightmost boundary, these blocks did not move. This strongly suggests that a simple presence of any color 12 and color 9 blocks at an eligible location is not sufficient for ACTION4 to cause movement. There must be an additional, unobservable condition (e.g., specific block instance or a 'selection' state) for 'move right' to occur, or these are not the 'player entity' that ACTION4 moves in this context. Furthermore, the background is green, not orange, disallowing the reset condition.",
