Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 either moves a specific combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) one unit to the right, or it triggers a complete game state reset. The move right effect is conditional on the player entity being present, likely selected, and not at a boundary, and not colliding with other objects. The game state reset effect occurs under specific unobserved conditions, possibly tied to the previous level's success or failure, or a different game mode. However, the current understanding of the 'move right' condition is incomplete, as the presence of the expected blocks at eligible locations has not reliably caused movement."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (8 total):
  [1] NO EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area with various colored blocks, including a color 12 (8x2) block at (8,40) and a color 9 (8x6) block at (10,40). No objects appear to be selected or in a highlighted state. All numerous other blocks and UI elements remain static. The background is green, not orange, which discounts the reset condition.
      Interpretation: ACTION4 had no visible effect on any objects or the environment. The state before and after the action is identical. Neither the expected 'move right' of the player entity nor a game state reset occurred.

Recent Observations:
  - Further evidence that the simple presence of color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks is not sufficient for ACTION4 to cause a rightward movement. There must be an additional, unobservable condition for move right to occur, or these are not the 'player entity' that ACTION4 moves.
  - The 'game reset' behavior previously observed for ACTION4 is not triggered when the background is green.
  - ACTION4 appears to require a specific instance or a 'selected' state for the color 12 and color 9 blocks to move right, not just their generic presence.
  - It is now strongly indicated that ACTION4's 'move right' functionality is dependent on more than just the presence and position of generic color 12 and color 9 blocks. There's an unobserved condition such as block identity or 'selection' state.
  - The 'game reset' behavior for ACTION4 is clearly linked to the previous game state (orange background) and does not occur in the green background state.
