  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in the current state and surroundings. While it is tempting to try ACTION5 again, it is important to first use movement actions to change the game state. Since ACTION1 has 2/3 consistent observations, it is close to being verified. Testing it to get the third consistent observation is efficient. Additionally, moving the blocks will change the context for potentially retesting ACTION5 later.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify ACTION1 definition and understand its limits/dependencies, and change the game state for future testing of other actions, especially ACTION5.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows the selected blocks (color 12 and color 9) in a relatively central position. Multiple previous attempts of ACTION5 have had no effect from various positions, including the current one. It's crucial to move the active blocks to a new position to continue exploring all actions effectively."
