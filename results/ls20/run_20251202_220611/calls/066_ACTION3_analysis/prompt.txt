Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION3:
"ACTION3 causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) to move one unit to the left."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The game environment includes a light-green play area. Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved upwards with ACTION1 and downwards with ACTION2. They are positioned within the play area, not at its left boundary.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 40, moved one unit to the left. The color 12 block moved from column 40 to 39, and the color 9 block moved from column 40 to 39. Their row positions remained unchanged.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area. The two active blocks (color 12 and color 9) are positioned within this area at (32,48) and (34,48) respectively, not at its left boundary. There are other static blocks and UI elements.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both initially at column 48, moved one unit to the left. The color 12 block moved from row 32 to 32, column 48 to 47. The color 9 block moved from row 34 to 34, column 48 to 47. Their row positions remained unchanged.

  - Color 8 64x64 block at row 0, col 0 (new background): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 4 64x64 block at (0,0) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 8x6 block at row 50, col 40 (new 'player' component): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 8x2 block at row 48, col 40 (new 'player' component): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 5 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,32) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,32) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION2 is not a simple movement action.
  - ACTION2 appears to be a major game state alteration, possibly a 'level reset' or 'level change' action.
  - The game has a 'reset' or 'level advance' mechanism that can be triggered by actions, not just through a dedicated 'reset' action.
  - ACTION4 can behave as a 'game reset/level change' action under specific, currently unknown, contexts.
  - The 'player' blocks (color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6)) are consistent across normal movement actions, but when a reset/level change occurs, their type might be swapped or newly created with varied positions.
