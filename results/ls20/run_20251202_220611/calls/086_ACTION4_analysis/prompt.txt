Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 either moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) one unit to the right, or causes a complete game state reset. Rightward movement is blocked by walls/boundaries or the absence of the 'player entity'. The conditions for triggering a game reset are currently unknown but seem to be related to the overall state of the game environment (e.g., orange background). If the player entity is not present, or if it is at a boundary, or if some other unknown condition is not met, the action may have no effect."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (5 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game environment was reset from a singular orange screen with a small 'player entity' to a green background with a complex light-green play area containing numerous static and dynamic objects. This is a complete game state overhaul.
      Interpretation: The game state completely changed. The environment reset from an orange background with a 'player entity' at (24,32) and (26,32) to a green background with a light-green play area. All objects from the 'before' state disappeared. Numerous new objects appeared, including the two primary 'player' blocks (color 12 and color 9) at (48,40) and (50,40), other colored blocks, and UI elements. This indicates ACTION4 also has a 'reset' or 'level change' function, similar to what was observed with ACTION2 in a previous turn.
  [2] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area with various colored blocks, but specifically, the color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks that normally move with ACTION4 are not among the listed 'objects before action' at coordinates that would enable a 'move right' effect. There are numerous other blocks and UI elements, all remaining static.
      Interpretation: ACTION4 had no visible effect on any objects or the environment. The state before and after the action is identical.
  [3] NO EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game environment displays a light-green play area with various colored blocks, including a color 12 (8x2) block at (8,40) and a color 9 (8x6) block at (10,40). No objects appear to be selected or in a highlighted state. There are numerous other blocks and UI elements, all remaining static.
      Interpretation: ACTION4 had no visible effect on any objects or the environment. The state before and after the action is identical. The two active blocks (color 12 rectangular block at (8,40) and color 9 rectangular block at (10,40)) did not move right. This is the third consecutive observation where ACTION4 had no effect, and the second consecutive observation where it failed to cause a rightward movement.

  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (10, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - The 'player' blocks (color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6)) are consistent across normal movement actions, but when a reset/level change occurs, their type might be swapped or newly created with varied positions.
  - ACTION2 has two distinct behaviors: a 'move down' behavior for two specific blocks, and a 'game reset/level change' behavior. The specific conditions that trigger the 'game reset/level change' are still unknown, but seems to occur when the game environment is in a non-standard state (e.g. orange background).
  - The 'move down' behavior of ACTION2 is consistent across multiple observations now.
  - ACTION4 appears to have more complex conditions for its 'move right' functionality than just presence of the color 12 and color 9 blocks and not being at a boundary. It might require specific instances of these blocks or a 'selected' state.
  - The 'player entity' blocks that can be moved by ACTION4 might be a different type of color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) block than the ones currently present in the 'objects before action' list. Or the game considers them 'not movable' in this state.
