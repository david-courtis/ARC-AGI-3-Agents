  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state, so we must first move to a new position before retesting it. Although ACTION4 is not yet fully verified, it has shown consistent movement of the primary objects, making it the most reliable known movement action to change the state. Moving the objects will create a different context for ACTION5, potentially revealing its function or confirming that it's context-dependent. The goal is to move the blocks away from the wall to see if 'interact' has a different effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to either see an effect from ACTION5 in the new position, or further confirm that it does nothing in this context. This will help us understand if ACTION5 is dependent on specific object proximity or environmental features.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows the primary movable blocks (Color 12 and Color 9) at (48, 32) and (50, 32) respectively, slightly to the right of their initial position. They are not near any obvious interactive elements. The previous attempt with ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting that its function might be linked to specific objects or environmental contexts that are not currently present or that the selected blocks are not in a 'interactable' state."
