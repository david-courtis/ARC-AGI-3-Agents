  "reasoning": "ACTION4 had two recent 'no-effect' attempts, meaning we cannot test it in the current state. We need to move the player entity to a new position using a verified action. ACTION1 is fully verified and its effect is clear (move up). Moving up twice should significantly change the player's position, providing a new context to test ACTION4.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION4 in a new position, we hope to disambiguate its 'move right' and 'game reset' behaviors, and, more importantly, determine why it had no effect previously. We are looking for conditions under which the player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) can be moved right, or if the game reset is triggered by something other than the orange background. We also want to confirm if the current player entity is indeed movable by ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board features several blocks, including the potential 'player' entities (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) in various locations. There is a prominent light-green play area. The top-left region has a magenta line, and the top-right has orange and green squares. The current position of the player entity (implied to be the two blocks that move together) is not explicitly given, but the previous ACTION4 'no effect' suggests it's in a state unfavorable for rightward movement or reset. The goal is to move to a new, distinct position to re-test the action."
