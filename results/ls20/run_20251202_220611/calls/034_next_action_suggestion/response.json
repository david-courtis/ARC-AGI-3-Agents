  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect because it's been tested in states where it's blocked. Since none of the movement actions are verified, we have to prioritize validating them. ACTION3 has the least attempts and most uncertain definition, making it the highest priority for further testing. It has only 1 attempt and 0 consistent results. The current position does not seemingly impede movement to the left.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe the effect of ACTION3 and gather more data points to verify its definition. We need 3 consistent observations to verify ACTION3.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state provides ample space to test movement actions. The active blocks are in a central enough position that they are not immediately against a boundary that would block leftward movement."
