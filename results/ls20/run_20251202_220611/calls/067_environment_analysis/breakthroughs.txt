1. Confirmed that the player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) can move horizontally (left in this instance) within the Color 7 play area.
2. ACTION3 causes the player entity to move left, demonstrating a horizontal movement capability not previously observed due to focus on vertical immobility.
3. The UI element (Color 13) at the very top of the screen provides visual feedback when movement occurs, even for a single pixel (e.g., ACTION3 causes a change from 4 green dots to 3 green dots and 1 red dot if it lands on a pixel of color 8 and 10 and 13 as a color 8 dot changes to a color 13 dot).
