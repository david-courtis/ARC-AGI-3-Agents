  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the last several attempts, so we must change the game state before re-testing it. ACTION1 is a verified movement action; using it will move the player entity to a new position, thus changing the state to allow for a re-test of ACTION5. Testing ACTION5 is a high priority as it has 0 consistent observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to find any context where ACTION5 might have an effect. By moving the player entity, we might encounter a new scenario that makes ACTION5 active, or further solidify its 'no-op' definition.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows the player entity in a specific position within the light-green play area. There are other objects present, but no immediate context that would suggest an interaction from a 'no-effect' action. The previous attempts of ACTION5 were all no-op, requiring a change in state for new observation."
