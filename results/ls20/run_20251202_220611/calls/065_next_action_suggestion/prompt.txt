Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: VERIFIED - ACTION1 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up (decreasing their row position by 1), as long as they are not at the top edge of the play area and there are no immediate obstacles above them. This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a complete reset or level change of the game environment. All existing objects are removed, the background color changes, and a new set of objects is introduced, potentially indicating a new level or game state.
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) to move one unit to the left.
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4, under certain circumstances, appears to trigger a complete game state reset or level change. This includes changing the background, removing all existing objects, and introducing a new set of objects in new positions. When this reset function is not triggered, ACTION4 moves two specific, currently selected/active, rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block) one unit to the right.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect, regardless of the position of the movable blocks or whether they are at boundaries. There are no observed conditions under which it produces a change. It is not an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position' action as previously hypothesized, because no such interaction/selection/rotation has ever been observed.

  - New color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 8 64x64 block at row 0, col 0 (new background): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 4 64x64 block at (0,0) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 8x6 block at row 50, col 40 (new 'player' component): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 8x2 block at row 48, col 40 (new 'player' component): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 5 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,32) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,32) (disappeared): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION2 is not a simple movement action.
  - ACTION2 appears to be a major game state alteration, possibly a 'level reset' or 'level change' action.
  - The game has a 'reset' or 'level advance' mechanism that can be triggered by actions, not just through a dedicated 'reset' action.
  - ACTION4 can behave as a 'game reset/level change' action under specific, currently unknown, contexts.
  - The 'player' blocks (color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6)) are consistent across normal movement actions, but when a reset/level change occurs, their type might be swapped or newly created with varied positions.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5
