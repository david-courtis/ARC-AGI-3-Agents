  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has only 1 consistent observation out of 2 attempts, meaning we still need 2 more consistent observations to verify its behavior. It has not been attempted since it last showed an effect, so we can test it directly. The definition states it moves two specific rectangular blocks to the left, which is a movement action, so it is unlikely to have 'no effect' as long as there is space to move left. The current state has no immediate leftward obstacles for the player blocks, making it a suitable state to test ACTION3. We want to avoid testing the 'reset' actions (ACTION2, ACTION4) unless absolutely necessary, as they disrupt the current state and make it harder to systematically test specific movement actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To gain more consistent observations for ACTION3, moving it closer to verification. We want to confirm its leftward movement without triggering any unexpected side effects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, after the last two 'reset' actions, appears to be a fresh configuration. There are clearly identifiable player blocks (color 12 and 9) in the center-right of the main play area. There's ample free space around these blocks, particularly to the left, making it suitable for testing leftward movement. The background is a consistent light green."
