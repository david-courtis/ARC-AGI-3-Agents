Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)\n2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)\n3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to\ndiscover context-dependent behaviors."

This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a complete reset or level change of the game environment. All existing objects are removed, the background color changes, and a new set of objects is introduced, potentially indicating a new level or game state.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) to move one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4, under certain circumstances, appears to trigger a complete game state reset or level change. This includes changing the background, removing all existing objects, and introducing a new set of objects in new positions. When this reset function is not triggered, ACTION4 moves two specific, currently selected/active, rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block) one unit to the right.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect, regardless of the position of the movable blocks or whether they are at boundaries. There are no observed conditions under which it produces a change. It is not an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position' action as previously hypothesized, because no such interaction/selection/rotation has ever been observed.\n\nRECENT ACTION HISTORY (last 10 actions taken):\n  1.

Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
