  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in 8 attempts and is the only action with 0/3 consistent observations. It is imperative to test it in a new state. Since ACTION2 has 1/3 consistent observations and its definition indicates it moves objects downwards, applying it twice should reliably change the position of the movable blocks without losing them off-screen. This fulfills the critical rule of moving to a new position before retesting a no-effect action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after changing the position of the movable blocks using a verified movement, we aim to discover if ACTION5's lack of effect is context-dependent or if it is genuinely a no-op action. If it still has no effect, we will have stronger evidence for it being a no-op.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the interactive blocks near the center-right. ACTION5 has been observed to have no effect recently in this general area. A reliable movement action like ACTION2 (downwards) will shift these blocks to a new position, allowing for a fresh test of ACTION5 under different conditions."
