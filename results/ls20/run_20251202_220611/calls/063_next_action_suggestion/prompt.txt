Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: VERIFIED - ACTION1 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up (decreasing their row position by 1), as long as they are not at the top edge of the play area and there are no immediate obstacles above them. This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a complete reset or level change of the game environment. All existing objects are removed, the background color changes, and a new set of objects is introduced, potentially indicating a new level or game state.
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) to move one unit to the left.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves two specific, currently selected/active, rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block) one unit to the right. This action likely acts on 'selected' or 'active' objects as it consistently moves two specific blocks.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect, regardless of the position of the movable blocks or whether they are at boundaries. There are no observed conditions under which it produces a change. It is not an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position' action as previously hypothesized, because no such interaction/selection/rotation has ever been observed.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 48): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (32, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (34, 48): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (24, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - All objects from previous state: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Background color: Involved in ACTION2 action
  - New color 12 64x64 shape at (0,0): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - New color 9 48x48 shape at (8,8): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - New color 5 rectangular block (8x2) at (24,32): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - New color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (26,32): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION5 is a no-op action.
  - The 'player entity' is composed of a Color 12 (8x2) block and a Color 9 (8x6) block that move together.
  - Movement appears to be confined within the light-green play area (Color 7).
  - ACTION2 is not a simple movement action.
  - ACTION2 appears to be a major game state alteration, possibly a 'level reset' or 'level change' action.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1
