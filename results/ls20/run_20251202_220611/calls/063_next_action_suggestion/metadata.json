This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 causes a complete reset or level change of the game environment. All existing objects are removed, the background color changes, and a new set of objects is introduced, potentially indicating a new level or game state.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12 and color 9) to move one unit to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves two specific, currently selected/active, rectangular blocks (a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block) one unit to the right. This action likely acts on 'selected' or 'active' objects as it consistently moves two specific blocks.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect, regardless of the position of the movable blocks or whether they are at boundaries. There are no observed conditions under which it produces a change.

Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration.

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently shown no effect and has been tested recently many times. Given that ACTION2 was just performed, which reset the game state and placed the blocks at a new position, it's a good opportunity to test ACTION4 which needs more validation. ACTION4 has only 1 consistent observation out of 3, and testing it now in the new, reset state can either provide another consistent observation or reveal context-dependency. We will prioritize collecting more data on an action that hasn't been fully validated yet, rather than one that has been definitively classified as a no-op.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to gain more observations for ACTION4 to either verify its known behavior (moving the blocks right) or discover new behaviors or conditions under which it acts differently. This will help us clarify if its effect is consistent across different game states or if it is context-dependent.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is a result of ACTION2, which reset the game. The active blocks (Color 12 and Color 9) are in a new initial position (Color 12 at (24,32) and Color 9 at (26,32)). This is a neutral and potentially good state to test movement actions, as there are no obvious obstacles immediately to the right. Since ACTION5 has been identified as a no-op, there is no value in testing it again, especially since the state has just changed, offering a fresh context for other pending actions."
