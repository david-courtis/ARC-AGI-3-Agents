Analyze the effect of action ACTION2.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION2:
"ACTION2 causes the selected objects, if movable, to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate)."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: The game environment contains a prominent light-green play area. Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 and one color 9, are present within this area. These are the same two blocks that moved upwards with ACTION1, now having returned to a lower position relative to the play area.
      Interpretation: Two rectangular blocks, one color 12 (8x2) and one color 9 (8x6), both located at column 40, moved one unit downwards. The color 12 block moved from row 40 to 41, and the color 9 block moved from row 42 to 43. This is the opposite of ACTION1.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (40, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (42, 48): Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - The two active/selected blocks appear to be a color 12 (8x2) and a color 9 (8x6) block. Their positions can vary.
  - ACTION4 consistently moves these two blocks one unit to the right.
  - ACTION5 might be a no-op or has conditions for effects that have not been met in any observed state.
  - The two active/selected blocks (color 12 and color 9) consistently move together.
