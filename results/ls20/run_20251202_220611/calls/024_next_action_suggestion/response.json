  ],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect recently, with 3 consecutive no-effect attempts. According to the critical rules, we MUST use a setup sequence to move first before re-testing an action that previously had no effect. Since ACTION4 has 1 consistent observation, it is the most reliable movement action we have. However, due to its definition only moving right, it may not be suitable. ACTION3 has successfully moved the blocks left in a previous attempt, making it a good candidate for a setup action to change the position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the active blocks to a new position using ACTION3 and then attempting ACTION5, we hope to determine if ACTION5's 'no effect' was context-dependent (e.g., being at a boundary or against an obstacle) or if it truly has no effect in general. This test might reveal when ACTION5 becomes effective.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows the two player blocks in a position where previous attempts of ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting a possible boundary or obstruction. Moving them to a different horizontal position might change the outcome for ACTION5."
