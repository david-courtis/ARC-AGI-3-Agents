Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: VERIFIED - ACTION1 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit up (decreasing their row position by 1), as long as they are not at the top edge of the play area and there are no immediate obstacles above them. This movement appears to be within the main light-green play area.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 primarily causes two specific rectangular blocks (color 12, 8x2 and color 9, 8x6) to move one unit downwards (increase row/y coordinate) within the play area, provided they are not at the bottom edge and there are no obstacles directly below them. In specific, previously observed contexts,ACTION2 can also trigger a complete game environment reset or level change, removing all current objects, changing the background, and introducing new sets of objects, including new 'player' entities.
  ACTION3: 2/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) one unit to the left within the Color 7 play area. This action impacts UI elements based on interaction.
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 either moves a specific combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9 blocks) one unit to the right, or it triggers a complete game state reset. The move right effect is conditional on the player entity being present, likely selected, and not at a boundary, and not colliding with other objects. The game state reset effect occurs under specific unobserved conditions, possibly tied to the previous level's success or failure, or a different game mode. However, the current understanding of the 'move right' condition is incomplete, as the presence of the expected blocks at eligible locations has not reliably caused movement.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 is a no-op action. It consistently has no visible effect on the player entity or environment.

Recent Observations:
  - Further evidence that the simple presence of color 12 (8x2) and color 9 (8x6) blocks is not sufficient for ACTION4 to cause a rightward movement. There must be an additional, unobservable condition for move right to occur, or these are not the 'player entity' that ACTION4 moves.
  - The 'game reset' behavior previously observed for ACTION4 is not triggered when the background is green.
  - ACTION4 appears to require a specific instance or a 'selected' state for the color 12 and color 9 blocks to move right, not just their generic presence.
  - It is now strongly indicated that ACTION4's 'move right' functionality is dependent on more than just the presence and position of generic color 12 and color 9 blocks. There's an unobserved condition such as block identity or 'selection' state.
  - The 'game reset' behavior for ACTION4 is clearly linked to the previous game state (orange background) and does not occur in the green background state.
