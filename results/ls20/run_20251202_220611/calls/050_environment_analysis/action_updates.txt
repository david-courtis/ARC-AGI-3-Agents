ACTION5: ACTION5 attempts to move the combined player entity (Color 12 and Color 9) upwards but cannot, as the player entity is currently against the upper Color 0 boundary/top edge of the Color 7 play area.
  Reason: Repeated observations confirm ACTION5 has no effect when the player is against the top boundary. It is highly probable that ACTION5 is an 'up' movement action, but is being blocked.
