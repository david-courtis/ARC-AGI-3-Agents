  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks downwards. These blocks appear to be coupled and maintain their relative vertical alignment after the movement. The distance moved is 8 units.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n  - The pair of Color 12 (8x2) and Color 9 (8x6) blocks are consistently coupled and move together. All actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) observed so far act on this coupled pair.\n  - ACTION2 moves the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks downwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, according to the rules, we must move to a different state before re-testing it. ACTION1 has 2 consistent observations, indicating it reliably moves the coupled blocks upwards. Moving the blocks upwards will change their position, allowing us to re-test ACTION5 in a new context. We prioritize re-testing ACTION5 as it has not yet yielded any consistent effect and needs exploration.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION1 first, we will change the position of the coupled blocks. We then expect to observe if ACTION5 now has an effect in this new position, helping us to understand its function or context-dependent nature.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks are in a certain position. ACTION5 previously had no effect in this current position, making it necessary to move the blocks before re-testing ACTION5."
