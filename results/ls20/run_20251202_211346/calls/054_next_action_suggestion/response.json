  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, according to the rules, we must move to a different state before re-testing it. ACTION1 has 2 consistent observations, indicating it reliably moves the coupled blocks upwards. Moving the blocks upwards will change their position, allowing us to re-test ACTION5 in a new context. We prioritize re-testing ACTION5 as it has not yet yielded any consistent effect and needs exploration.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION1 first, we will change the position of the coupled blocks. We then expect to observe if ACTION5 now has an effect in this new position, helping us to understand its function or context-dependent nature.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks are in a certain position. ACTION5 previously had no effect in this current position, making it necessary to move the blocks before re-testing ACTION5."
