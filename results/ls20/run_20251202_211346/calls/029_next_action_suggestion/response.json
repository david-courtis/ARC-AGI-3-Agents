  ],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, according to the rules, we must first change the game state by performing a setup sequence with a known action. ACTION1 is a good choice as it has 1/3 consistent observations and moves the coupled blocks upwards, changing their position and potentially a different context for ACTION5. After moving, testing ACTION5 again will help us understand its conditions for success.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to either see an effect from ACTION5 in a new position, thus gaining more information about its function and conditions, or to confirm it still has no effect, which would suggest it requires a different context or object to interact with.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state has the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks at a certain position. ACTION5 previously had no effect from this or a similar state. Therefore, it is important to change the position of these blocks before re-testing ACTION5."
