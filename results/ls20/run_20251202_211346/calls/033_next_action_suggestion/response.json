  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt and the critical rule dictates that we must move to a new position before retesting. ACTION1 is a partially verified action that moves the coupled blocks upwards. By performing ACTION1 twice, we will be in a new state, far from the previous 'no effect' state for ACTION5. This strategy maximizes the chance of observing an effect for ACTION5, as it might be context-dependent or require the blocks to be in a different position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect for ACTION5 and get closer to understanding its function. If successful, this will provide the first consistent observation for ACTION5. If it still has no effect, it will further validate that ACTION5 is sensitive to object positions or states.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks. Given ACTION5 previously had no effect in this general area, it's crucial to move these blocks significantly before re-testing ACTION5. Moving them upwards with ACTION1 appears safe and distinct from previous testing positions."
