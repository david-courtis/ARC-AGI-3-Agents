  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks downwards. These blocks appear to be coupled and maintain their relative vertical alignment after the movement. The distance moved is 8 units.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n  - The pair of Color 12 (8x2) and Color 9 (8x6) blocks are consistently coupled and move together. All actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) observed so far act on this coupled pair.\n  - ACTION2 moves the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks downwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, according to the rules, I must move to a different position before re-testing it. ACTION1 is a good choice for a setup action as it has shown consistent movement for the coupled blocks, and moving the blocks up will change the context for ACTION5. I've chosen to move them up by 8 units rather than left, right or down to explore space.  I want to get a positive effect out of ACTION5 or find out what kind of state causes it to have an effect. This move moves the 'agent' or the coupled blocks to a new position to try ACTION5 again.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By moving to a new position using ACTION1 and then trying ACTION5, I expect to either: 1) Observe an effect from ACTION5, which would help in defining its behavior. 2) Confirm that ACTION5 still has no effect in this new position, suggesting a need for even more varied contexts or different object interactions to trigger it. This will help understand the conditions under which ACTION5 is activated.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks at a certain position. ACTION5 previously had no effect from this or a similar state. The environment provides ample space upwards to move the blocks using ACTION1, which will provide a different context for re-evaluating ACTION5 without hitting boundaries immediately."
