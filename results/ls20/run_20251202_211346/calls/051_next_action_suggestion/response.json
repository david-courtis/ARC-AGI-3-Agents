  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the rules, we must move to a different state before retesting it. ACTION4 seems to move the coupled blocks to the right, which will change the object's position. This allows us to re-test ACTION5 in a new context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We hope to discover the effect of ACTION5 in a different position. If it still has no effect, it might require a very specific environmental trigger or context. If it does have an effect, we will begin to define its function.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks are currently at a known position. We need to move them to a new position to re-test ACTION5, which previously had no effect. The current position does not seem to hinder movement actions for the coupled blocks, so ACTION4 should work as a setup sequence."
