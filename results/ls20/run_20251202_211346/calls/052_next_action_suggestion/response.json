  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had a 'no effect' result recently. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying a no-effect action. Since we don't have any VERIFIED actions yet, I will use some of the actions that have some consistent observations to move the object around significantly. ACTION3 moves left, ACTION2 moves down. I will move the object left and down multiple times to ensure a different state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a new observation for ACTION5. This new observation will either confirm a specific effect under new conditions or provide another 'no effect' result, which will inform us that this action might be very context-specific or indeed does nothing.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows the coupled blocks at a certain position. To re-test ACTION5, which previously had no effect, we need to drastically change the position of the manipulable objects. The current position has been explored for ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5, so a new position is crucial for gaining new information about ACTION5."
