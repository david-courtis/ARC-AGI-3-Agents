  ],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt and testing it again in the same state is unlikely to yield a different result. Since ACTION1 has had a consistent effect (moving coupled blocks upwards), we can use it as a setup sequence to change the position of the relevant objects before re-testing ACTION5. This follows the critical rule of moving to a new position before retrying a no-effect action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Testing ACTION5 after a position change may reveal its conditions for having an effect, or consistently confirm it has no effect, which is also valuable information.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks. ACTION5 previously had no effect in a similar state. To gain new information on ACTION5, a change in object position is necessary."
