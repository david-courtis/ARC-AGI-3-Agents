  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, according to the critical rules, we must first change the game state using a verified or well-understood action before retesting ACTION5. ACTION1 is a good candidate for a setup action as it has shown consistent movement and moves the coupled blocks upwards, changing their position in the environment. We want to move the blocks to a different position to see if ACTION5 will have an effect in a new context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a movement with ACTION1, we aim to determine if ACTION5's effect is context-dependent and requires a different position or interaction with other objects to activate. If it still has no effect, we can infer it might require a more specific context or is unrelated to the movable blocks.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks. ACTION5 previously had no effect in likely this or a similar state. Moving these blocks with ACTION1 will change their position and potentially reveal conditions under which ACTION5 might become active. We are prioritizing actions that need more validation, and ACTION5 is still completely unknown."
