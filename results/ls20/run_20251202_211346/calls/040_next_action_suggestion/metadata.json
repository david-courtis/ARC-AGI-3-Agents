  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks downwards. These blocks appear to be coupled and maintain their relative vertical alignment after the movement. The distance moved is 8 units.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n  - The pair of Color 12 (8x2) and Color 9 (8x6) blocks are consistently coupled and move together. All actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) observed so far act on this coupled pair.\n  - ACTION2 moves the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks downwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, according to the critical rules, we must first change the game state using a verified or well-understood action before retesting ACTION5. ACTION1 is a good candidate for a setup action as it has shown consistent movement and moves the coupled blocks upwards, changing their position in the environment. We want to move the blocks to a different position to see if ACTION5 will have an effect in a new context.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a movement with ACTION1, we aim to determine if ACTION5's effect is context-dependent and requires a different position or interaction with other objects to activate. If it still has no effect, we can infer it might require a more specific context or is unrelated to the movable blocks.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks. ACTION5 previously had no effect in likely this or a similar state. Moving these blocks with ACTION1 will change their position and potentially reveal conditions under which ACTION5 might become active. We are prioritizing actions that need more validation, and ACTION5 is still completely unknown."
