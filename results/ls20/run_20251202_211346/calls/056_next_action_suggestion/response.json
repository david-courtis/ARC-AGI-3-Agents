  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt and testing it again in the same state would yield the same result. Therefore, a setup sequence is required to change the state. Since 'ACTION1' is 1/3 consistent and moves the coupled blocks upwards, using it twice will significantly change the position of the movable blocks and provide a fresh context for testing ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after changing the position of the coupled blocks, we aim to discover if its effect is context-dependent. If it still has no effect, we will have more confidence that ACTION5 either does nothing or requires an even more specific context not yet encountered. If it now has an effect, we will begin to understand its function.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state has the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks at a specific position. There is no immediate contextual clue for ACTION5. Therefore, changing the blocks' position is crucial for retesting ACTION5 effectively."
