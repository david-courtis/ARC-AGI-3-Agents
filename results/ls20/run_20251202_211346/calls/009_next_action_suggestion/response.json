  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been observed, making it the highest priority for initial testing to gather basic information about its effect. Since no actions had a 'NO EFFECT' outcome recently, there is no need for a setup sequence to change position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe the initial effect of ACTION5 and begin to form a hypothesis about what it does. This is critical for broader game exploration.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state is suitable for testing a new, unobserved action as there are no immediate constraints or prior 'NO EFFECT' outcomes dictating a change in position."
