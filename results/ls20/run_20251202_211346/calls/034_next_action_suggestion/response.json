  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retesting an action that previously had no effect. ACTION1 has been consistently observed to move the coupled blocks, making it a suitable choice for a setup move. Since all current movement actions affect the same coupled blocks, moving them with ACTION1 will sufficiently change the state for retesting ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By retesting ACTION5 after a position change, we aim to discover if ACTION5 is context-dependent and what its effect is under different circumstances. If it still has no effect, we will know it's not simply location-dependent relative to this particular coupled block.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows a coupled Color 12 and Color 9 block. This block has been the target of ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4. ACTION5 recently had no effect, suggesting it might be context-dependent or require interaction with other, as yet unidentified, game elements. To explore context-dependency, we need to alter the position of the coupled blocks before retesting ACTION5."
