  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt (recent action #5). According to the rules, if an action had no effect, we must perform a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying that action. Since ACTION1 is observed to move the coupled blocks upwards, it will change the position, allowing us to retest ACTION5. The goal is to provide a new context for ACTION5 to potentially reveal its function.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 in a new position, we hope to discover its effect, or confirm that it has no effect in this new configuration, helping us to narrow down its contextual dependencies.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks are at a specific position. We need to move them to a new position to retest ACTION5 effectively. There are no immediate obstructions for moving upwards."
