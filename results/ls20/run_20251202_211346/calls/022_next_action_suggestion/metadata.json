  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt and we must move to a different state before retesting it. Since no actions are yet verified for consistent movement, we will use ACTION2, which had a verifiable effect in the recent history, to change the position of the coupled blocks, thus changing the game state. This satisfies the condition of trying an action that previously had no effect in a new state. We prioritize filling in knowledge for all actions, so revisiting one that had no effect but is not yet fully validated is a good next step. ACTION2 moves the blocks down, which should provide a sufficiently different state.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION5 in a different game state. This will help us determine if ACTION5 has context-dependent behavior or if it consistently has no effect, allowing us to eventually verify its behavior.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks at a specific position. ACTION5 previously had no effect in this or a very similar state. To make progress on understanding ACTION5, we need to change the position of these blocks. Using ACTION2 will move the blocks down (as it had this effect previously), creating a new context for testing ACTION5."
