  "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had no effect, so we need to move the coupled blocks to a different position before retrying it. ACTION1 is a partially verified action that moves the blocks upwards. We will use it as part of a setup sequence to change the game state. After moving, we will re-test ACTION5 to see if it now has an effect in the new context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect from ACTION5 in a new position, or confirm that it consistently has no effect regardless of position. This will help us understand its behavior or confirm its inertness.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks. ACTION5 previously had no effect in this (or a similar) state. To properly test ACTION5, we need to change its context by moving the relevant objects using a known action like ACTION1."
