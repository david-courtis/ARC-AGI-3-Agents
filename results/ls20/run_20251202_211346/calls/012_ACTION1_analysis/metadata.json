  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:\n\"ACTION1 moves a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards. It seems to move both by the same amount, maintaining their relative positions.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT\n      Context: There is a Color 12 block and a Color 9 block vertically aligned in the bottom right of the play area. Other objects are present but were not directly affected by this action.\n      Interpretation: ACTION1 caused the Color 12 rectangular block to move up, and the Color 9 rectangular block to move up. The relative positions of these two blocks appear to be maintained.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 129 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements.
