  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the rules, we must move to a different position before re-testing an action that had no effect. Since ACTION1 has 2/3 consistent observations and appears to reliably move the coupled blocks upwards, it is a good candidate for a setup move. Moving twice upwards will significantly change the position of the coupled blocks, providing a new context to test ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 in a new position, we aim to determine if its function is context-dependent or if it truly has no effect at all. We will observe if the new position enables ACTION5 to exhibit any behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks. ACTION5 previously had no effect. Using a setup sequence involving ACTION1 will move these coupled blocks to a new vertical position, making the environment different for re-testing ACTION5. The other actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) are still pending full verification, but their general movement effects are understood enough to use them in a setup sequence."
