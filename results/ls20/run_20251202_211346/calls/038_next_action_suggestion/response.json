  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the rules, I must move to a different position before re-testing it. ACTION1 has shown itself to reliably move the coupled blocks upwards. By performing ACTION1 twice, I aim to move the coupled blocks significantly away from their current position, ensuring a different context for testing ACTION5. While ACTION1 is not fully verified, its observed behavior is consistent, making it suitable for a setup sequence to change the environment.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Testing ACTION5 after a significant change in position will help determine if its 'no-effect' was context-dependent or if it truly has no effect under any circumstances. If it still has no effect, it provides further evidence for its non-functionality. If it now has an effect, we will begin to learn its definition.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks. ACTION5 previously had no effect in this or a very similar state. To investigate its functionality, a change in the blocks' position is necessary."
