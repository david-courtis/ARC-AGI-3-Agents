  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its last attempt. Per the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retesting an action that previously had no effect. We choose ACTION1 because it is one of the more understood actions and we need to move the coupled blocks, which ACTION1 does. We will move it twice to ensure a significant change in position. We choose ACTION5 as the target action because it is currently the least explored action (0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts).",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to either finally observe an effect for ACTION5 and begin to define its behavior, or confirm that ACTION5 has no effect even in a different position, which would suggest it might be a no-op.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks near the middle of the screen. ACTION5 previously had no effect, so it's critical to move the blocks to a new position before retesting it. Moving them up will change their position and potentially reveal if ACTION5 is position-dependent."
