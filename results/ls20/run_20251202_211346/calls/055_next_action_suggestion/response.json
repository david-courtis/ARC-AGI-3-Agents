  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt and the critical rule states that if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first. We need to test ACTION5 from a different position. Since ACTION1 has 2 consistent observations, it is a good candidate for a setup action. By moving the object upwards, we change the environment for testing ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to determine if ACTION5 has any effect in a different vertical position, helping to validate its behavior or confirm its lack of effect across various states.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled blocks are currently in a certain position. ACTION5 previously had no effect from this or a very similar position, hence moving them is necessary before re-testing ACTION5."
