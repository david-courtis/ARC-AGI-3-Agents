  "reasoning": "ACTION5 previously had no effect in the current state, so it's critical to test it in a new position. While none of the movement actions are fully verified, ACTION1 and ACTION2 have the most observations. Using ACTION1 twice will move the coupled blocks further up, creating a different environment to test ACTION5 and potentially revealing its context-dependent behavior if it interacts with things above.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe if ACTION5 has an effect in a different vertical position, helping to determine its function or if it is context-dependent. This will move it closer to being verified.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled blocks are currently near the bottom of the visible area. Moving them upwards will change their relative position to other potential game elements, which might be necessary for ACTION5 to function."
