  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [
    "ACTION1"
  ],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retesting it. Since ACTION1 has had consistent effects moving the coupled blocks upwards, it is a good choice to change the position for testing ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a movement using ACTION1, we hope to understand if ACTION5 requires a specific context or changes in object positions to have an effect. This will help us get closer to 1/3 consistent observations for ACTION5.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks. ACTION5 was tested at this position recently and had no effect. Therefore, it is necessary to change the position using a known working action before retesting ACTION5."
