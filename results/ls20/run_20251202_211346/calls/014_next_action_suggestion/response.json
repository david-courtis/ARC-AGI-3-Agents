  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state, so we must first move to a new position before retesting it. Since no actions are yet verified, we can use any action that had an effect to move. ACTION1 has had a consistent effect of moving the coupled blocks upwards. Moving the blocks upwards will change their position relative to the main block, giving ACTION5 a new context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect of ACTION5 in a new position, thereby gathering more data to define its effect or confirm if it consistently has no effect in different positions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks are at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. ACTION5 just had no effect in this current state."
