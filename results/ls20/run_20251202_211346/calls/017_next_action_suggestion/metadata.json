  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retesting it. Since no actions are yet verified for movement, we test a pending movement action (ACTION1) as a setup. ACTION1 has had one consistent effect observed and seems to move the coupled blocks up, which will change the position for testing ACTION5.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after changing the main object's position, we hope to either observe an effect for ACTION5, or gather more evidence that it has no effect under varied conditions, or discover a specific context required for its activation. We also aim to get a second consistent observation for ACTION1 to move towards its verification.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows two main block structures. The yellow and black block, and the cyan and purple block. Based on the action descriptions, ACTION1-4 likely control the movement of these blocks. ACTION5 had no effect in the prior state, potentially because it requires a different object state or position to be effective. The current position is not optimal for re-testing ACTION5 without a prior movement."
