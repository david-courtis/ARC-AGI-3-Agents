Analyze the effect of action ACTION2.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION2:
"None"

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (1 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT
      Context: There is a Color 12 block and a Color 9 block vertically aligned in the bottom right of the play area. These blocks were previously observed to move together when ACTION1 was taken (moving upwards).
      Interpretation: ACTION2 caused the Color 12 rectangular block to move down, and the Color 9 rectangular block to move down. These are the same two blocks that moved together in ACTION1, but in the opposite direction.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.
  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.
