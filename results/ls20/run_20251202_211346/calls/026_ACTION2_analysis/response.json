The movement seems coordinated, similar to previous observations, but there's a discrepancy in reporting the Color 9 block's state.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION2 moves the vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks downwards. These blocks appear to be coupled and maintain their relative vertical alignment after the movement. The distance moved is 8 units.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The Color 12 block at (16, 24) and the Color 9 block at (18, 24) were vertically aligned. There was no apparent obstruction below them, allowing them to move downwards. The observed coupling of these two block types across multiple actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) suggests that they are designed to move together.",
