  "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had no effect, so we must move to a different position before trying it again. ACTION1 is a good choice for a setup action as it moves the coupled blocks, which are the subject of most tested actions, to a new vertical position. We are prioritizing testing an action that has had zero consistent observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get the first consistent observation for ACTION5, or confirm that it still has no effect in a different game state, indicating it might require a specific, as-yet-undiscovered context.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks are in a visible state. Moving them upwards with ACTION1 prior to testing ACTION5 will change the position/context of these primary interactive elements."
