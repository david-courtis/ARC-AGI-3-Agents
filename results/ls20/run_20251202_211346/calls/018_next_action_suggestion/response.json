  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is the only action that has not been attempted yet and therefore has the highest priority. However, ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt from the current position. Therefore, a setup sequence is required to move the coupled blocks to a different position before retrying ACTION5. Since ACTION3 moves the coupled blocks to the left, using it twice will significantly change their position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to discover the effect of ACTION5 from a new position. This will help us determine if ACTION5 is context-dependent or if it consistently has no effect in all positions. If it still has no effect, we will know to prioritize other untested actions or explore other contexts for ACTION5.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows a coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular block in a central-right position. We have observed that ACTION1 moves it up, ACTION2 moves it down, ACTION3 moves it left, and ACTION4 moves it right. ACTION5 previously had no effect in this general area. The board appears to offer ample space for movement in different directions."
