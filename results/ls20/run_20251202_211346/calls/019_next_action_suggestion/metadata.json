  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had 'NO EFFECT' in the previous attempt (5th recent action). According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, we MUST use a setup sequence to move first before retrying it. Since we do not have any VERIFIED actions yet, we must use one of the PENDING actions. ACTION1 has the most progress (1/3 consistent) and its effect is understood enough to use it for repositioning. By repeatedly applying ACTION1, we can significantly change the position of the coupled blocks, thus changing the game state before re-testing ACTION5. We'll use ACTION1 several times to ensure a substantial change in position.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By moving the coupled blocks to a new position using ACTION1 and then re-testing ACTION5, we hope to either observe an effect for ACTION5 (if it's context-dependent) or confirm that it's a no-op across different states, which will contribute to its verification as a no-op.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks are currently near the bottom-left of the green area. The last ACTION5 attempt had no effect from this general position. To test ACTION5 effectively, we need to drastically change the position of these blocks to explore potential context dependencies for ACTION5."
