  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had 'NO EFFECT' in the previous attempt (5th recent action). According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, we MUST use a setup sequence to move first before retrying it. Since we do not have any VERIFIED actions yet, we must use one of the PENDING actions. ACTION1 has the most progress (1/3 consistent) and its effect is understood enough to use it for repositioning. By repeatedly applying ACTION1, we can significantly change the position of the coupled blocks, thus changing the game state before re-testing ACTION5. We'll use ACTION1 several times to ensure a substantial change in position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the coupled blocks to a new position using ACTION1 and then re-testing ACTION5, we hope to either observe an effect for ACTION5 (if it's context-dependent) or confirm that it's a no-op across different states, which will contribute to its verification as a no-op.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks are currently near the bottom-left of the green area. The last ACTION5 attempt had no effect from this general position. To test ACTION5 effectively, we need to drastically change the position of these blocks to explore potential context dependencies for ACTION5."
