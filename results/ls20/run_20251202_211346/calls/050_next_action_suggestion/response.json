  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its previous attempt, so according to the rules, we must first use a setup sequence to move to a different position before testing it again. ACTION1 is a partially verified action that moves the coupled blocks upwards by 8 units, which will change the position sufficiently. This allows us to re-test ACTION5 in a new context.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect from ACTION5 in a new position, or to gather more 'no effect' data points that might help us deduce its specific context or prerequisites. This will help us move towards verifying its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks are in a central area. Moving them upwards with ACTION1 will provide a different spatial context to test ACTION5."
