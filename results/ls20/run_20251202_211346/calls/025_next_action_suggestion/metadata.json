  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "target_action": "ACTION2",
    "setup_sequence": [],
    "reasoning": "ACTION2 has the fewest attempts (1/8) and has not had any consistent observations yet. While ACTION5 also has limited attempts (0/8), it had no effect recently. We have not verified any actions yet but we have some understanding of what ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4 do. Testing ACTION2, which is understood to move blocks downwards, is a good next step to try and gain more consistent observations. Since it hasn't had a 'no-effect' recently, we don't need a setup sequence.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe ACTION2's effect and hopefully gain one consistent observation towards its definition. This will help us confirm if it indeed moves the coupled blocks downwards and verify its behavior.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state seems suitable for testing basic movement actions. The coupled blocks are visible and in a central enough position that most movement actions should have a noticeable effect without immediately hitting boundaries. We have some understanding of directional movements but no actions are fully verified. ACTION5 recently had no effect, so it's a higher risk to test without moving the blocks around first."
