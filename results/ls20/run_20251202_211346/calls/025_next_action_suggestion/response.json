  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has the fewest attempts (1/8) and has not had any consistent observations yet. While ACTION5 also has limited attempts (0/8), it had no effect recently. We have not verified any actions yet but we have some understanding of what ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4 do. Testing ACTION2, which is understood to move blocks downwards, is a good next step to try and gain more consistent observations. Since it hasn't had a 'no-effect' recently, we don't need a setup sequence.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe ACTION2's effect and hopefully gain one consistent observation towards its definition. This will help us confirm if it indeed moves the coupled blocks downwards and verify its behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state seems suitable for testing basic movement actions. The coupled blocks are visible and in a central enough position that most movement actions should have a noticeable effect without immediately hitting boundaries. We have some understanding of directional movements but no actions are fully verified. ACTION5 recently had no effect, so it's a higher risk to test without moving the blocks around first."
