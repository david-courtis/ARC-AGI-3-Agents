  ],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had no effect, so we must move to a different position before testing it again. ACTION1 is a known action that moves the coupled blocks upwards. By moving the blocks upwards, we change their position relative to any potential interactable elements or boundaries, which might enable ACTION5 to have an effect. This is the most efficient way to get a new observation for ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to determine if ACTION5 has a context-dependent effect that was not present in the previous state. If it still has no effect, we will confirm it is not affected by vertical position changes. If it has an effect, we will begin to define its function.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled block is currently at (48, 40) for the Color 12 block and (50, 40) for the Color 9 block. This position might be a boundary or unfavorable for ACTION5. Moving it will allow for more comprehensive testing."
