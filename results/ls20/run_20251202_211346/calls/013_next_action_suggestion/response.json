  "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had no effect, so we must change the game state before re-testing it. Since no actions are yet verified, we choose a pending action (ACTION2) to move the coupled blocks, hoping to find a state where ACTION5 might have an effect. ACTION2 moves the blocks down, which is a significant change in position from where ACTION5 was last tested.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a movement action, we hope to find a context where it is effective, contributing to its definition and potentially verifying it. We also gain another observation for ACTION2.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks are active elements. ACTION1-4 seem to affect these blocks. ACTION5 needs more context to be understood, as it has previously had no effect. The current position of the coupled blocks after recent ACTION1 is (48, 40) and (50, 40). We need to move these to test ACTION5 effectively."
