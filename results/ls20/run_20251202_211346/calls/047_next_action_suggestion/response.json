  ],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had no effect, so we must move to a new state before retesting it. Given that ACTION1 is partially understood to move the coupled blocks upwards, using it as a setup action will change the position of the relevant objects, allowing for a re-evaluation of ACTION5 in a different context. This adheres to the critical rule of not re-testing a no-effect action in the same state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a movement (ACTION1), we aim to discover if its effect is context-dependent or if it truly has no effect. This helps in validating or disproving its initial 'no effect' observation and contributing to its verification status.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state is not ideal for retesting ACTION5 because it recently had no effect here. The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks are in a certain position. Moving them allows us to test ACTION5 under new conditions."
