  "reasoning": "ACTION5 resulted in 'no effect' in the previous attempt and therefore should not be re-tested in the same state. To generate a new state for ACTION5, we need to move the coupled blocks using a verified movement action. Since ACTION1 has had consistent movement upwards, it is a good candidate for a setup action to change the position of the blocks involved in all actions. This will allow for re-testing ACTION5 in a different context. Testing an unobserved action (ACTION5) that had no effect earlier is a high priority.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect for ACTION5. Moving the blocks with ACTION1 changes their vertical position, which might be a critical context for ACTION5 to produce an effect. If it still has no effect, we will have further evidence against a simple contextual dependency on vertical position and can try horizontal movement next.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks are currently at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. ACTION5 previously had no effect in a state that could have been similar to the current one. The main interactable objects are available and not against any explicit boundaries."
