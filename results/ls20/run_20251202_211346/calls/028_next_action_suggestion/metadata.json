  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks downwards. These blocks appear to be coupled and maintain their relative vertical alignment after the movement. The distance moved is 8 units.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n  - The pair of Color 12 (8x2) and Color 9 (8x6) blocks are consistently coupled and move together. All actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) observed so far act on this coupled pair.\n  - ACTION2 moves the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks downwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 resulted in 'no effect' in the previous attempt and therefore should not be re-tested in the same state. To generate a new state for ACTION5, we need to move the coupled blocks using a verified movement action. Since ACTION1 has had consistent movement upwards, it is a good candidate for a setup action to change the position of the blocks involved in all actions. This will allow for re-testing ACTION5 in a different context. Testing an unobserved action (ACTION5) that had no effect earlier is a high priority.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect for ACTION5. Moving the blocks with ACTION1 changes their vertical position, which might be a critical context for ACTION5 to produce an effect. If it still has no effect, we will have further evidence against a simple contextual dependency on vertical position and can try horizontal movement next.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks are currently at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. ACTION5 previously had no effect in a state that could have been similar to the current one. The main interactable objects are available and not against any explicit boundaries."
