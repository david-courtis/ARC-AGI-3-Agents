  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its prior attempt, so we must move to a new position before retesting it. Since our goal is to systematically validate actions and ACTION3 is a pending action (not yet verified), using it as part of the setup sequence is efficient as it allows us to test two pending actions at once while creating a new state and getting closer to verifying ACTION3. The definition for ACTION3 indicates it moves the coupled blocks to the left, which is a significant change in position from where ACTION5 previously failed. This will help us determine if ACTION5 is context-dependent or has no effect at all. Since we are in a relatively central position, moving left should not cause us to collide with walls.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a new observation for ACTION3, potentially moving it closer to verification. More importantly, we hope to learn if ACTION5 has any effect when executed from a different position or if it truly has no effect in any context.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled blocks are currently in a relatively central position. Several actions have been observed to act upon these blocks. ACTION5 previously had no effect from this general region. The current state is good for testing movement actions, but for re-testing a no-effect action (ACTION5), a change in position is necessary."
