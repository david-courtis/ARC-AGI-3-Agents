  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before re-testing an action that previously had no effect. ACTION1 is a good choice for a setup move as it effectively changes the position of the coupled blocks, and we know it moves them upwards by 8 units. After moving, we can re-test ACTION5 to see if its effect is context-dependent.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after changing the position of the coupled blocks using ACTION1, we aim to determine if ACTION5's effect is state-dependent. This will help us understand if ACTION5 operates on specific coordinates, relative positions, or if it requires certain conditions to be met for it to have an effect. We will either confirm it has no effect in this new state or discover its function.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks. ACTION5 previously had no visible effect in this or a similar state. The environment provides ample space for movement, so changing the position using ACTION1 is feasible and should not lead to any immediate constraints."
