  ],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state, so we must move to a new state before retesting it. Since ACTION1 has one consistent observation, it's considered a candidate for a setup action. Moving up might put the coupled blocks in a new context where ACTION5 could have an effect or allow us to observe a new interaction. We prioritize actions with 0/3 consistent observations first.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe an effect for ACTION5 in a different position, or confirm that it continues to have no effect, which would help us understand its context dependence. Also, re-testing ACTION1 will help validate previous observations, moving it closer to becoming a 'verified' action.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state has the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks at a specific position (48, 40) and (50,40) respectively. Since ACTION5 previously had no effect in this general vicinity, a change in position is required before re-testing it."
