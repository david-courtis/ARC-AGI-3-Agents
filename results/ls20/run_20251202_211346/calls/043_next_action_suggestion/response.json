  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying a no-effect action. ACTION1 is a partially understood action that moves the coupled blocks upwards, making it a suitable movement for testing. Since the movement of ACTION1 (and ACTION2-ACTION4) is well understood, it is safe to use as a setup and it will move the relevant blocks from current position (48,40) and (50,40) to (48,48) and (50,48) which is different enough to re-test the ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe an effect of ACTION5 in a new position, or to confirm that it consistently has no effect, regardless of the position of the coupled blocks, thus providing more data towards its verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. All actions ACTION1-ACTION4 are understood to move these two coupled blocks. ACTION5 previously had no effect."
