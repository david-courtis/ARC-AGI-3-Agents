  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks downwards. These blocks appear to be coupled and maintain their relative vertical alignment after the movement. The distance moved is 8 units.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n  - The pair of Color 12 (8x2) and Color 9 (8x6) blocks are consistently coupled and move together. All actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) observed so far act on this coupled pair.\n  - ACTION2 moves the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks downwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying a no-effect action. ACTION1 is a partially understood action that moves the coupled blocks upwards, making it a suitable movement for testing. Since the movement of ACTION1 (and ACTION2-ACTION4) is well understood, it is safe to use as a setup and it will move the relevant blocks from current position (48,40) and (50,40) to (48,48) and (50,48) which is different enough to re-test the ACTION5.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe an effect of ACTION5 in a new position, or to confirm that it consistently has no effect, regardless of the position of the coupled blocks, thus providing more data towards its verification.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. All actions ACTION1-ACTION4 are understood to move these two coupled blocks. ACTION5 previously had no effect."
