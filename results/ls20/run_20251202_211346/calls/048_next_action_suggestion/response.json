  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt (recent action history shows 'ACTION5: ✗ NO EFFECT'). According to the rules, if an action had no effect, I must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retesting it. ACTION1 is a partially understood movement action that reliably moves the coupled blocks upwards. By moving the blocks upwards, we change the game state and can re-evaluate ACTION5 to see if its behavior is context-dependent or if it still has no effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a state change, we aim to discover if ACTION5 is context-dependent or if it consistently has no effect in all tested states. This will help us determine if it's a non-functional action or if it requires a specific environmental trigger, contributing to our understanding of ACTION5's basic functionality (or lack thereof).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks. ACTION5 previously had no effect in this (or a very similar) state. To gain new information about ACTION5, it's crucial to test it in a modified environment. Moving the coupled blocks upwards via ACTION1 will provide this change without risking being against a wall or in another unfavorable position."
