  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous attempt and the critical rules state that if an action had no effect, it should not be tested again in the same state. Therefore, a setup sequence is required to move to a different position before retesting ACTION5. Since ACTION1 is a partially verified action that moves the coupled blocks upwards, it's a good choice to change the position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get a consistent observation for ACTION5 or observe a specific effect it has in a new spatial context. This would help us determine its function and move it towards verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows the coupled blocks in a specific position where ACTION5 previously had no effect. It's crucial to change this state to attempt to understand ACTION5's behavior."
