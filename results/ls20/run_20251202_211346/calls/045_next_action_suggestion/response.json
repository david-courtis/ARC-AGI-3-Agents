  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the rules, we must first use a setup sequence to move to a different position before re-testing an action that previously had no effect. ACTION1 moves the coupled blocks upwards, which is a verified partial movement. Performing it twice will ensure a significant change in position from where ACTION5 last failed, and since the game seems to only have one set of movable blocks, this will put them in a new context for ACTION5 to potentially have an effect. We choose to test ACTION5 next because it is the only action that has not yet had any consistent effect and exploring it will help us to understand its behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify if ACTION5 has an effect in a different vertical position. If an effect is observed, we can start defining ACTION5. If it still has no effect, we will need to try other positions or contexts.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks are in a central position. ACTION5 had no effect here. Moving them repeatedly with ACTION1 will shift their vertical position, which might provide a new context for ACTION5 to function."
