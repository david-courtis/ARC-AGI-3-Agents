  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state, so we must first move to a new position. All existing actions (ACTION1-4) are partially validated movement actions, thus we can use them to move. ACTION3 moves the coupled blocks to the left, providing a new position to re-test ACTION5. Testing actions that have not been observed (0/3 consistent) or need more validation is a priority. ACTION5 has had 0/3 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts, making it a high priority action to validate. We also have sufficient information from the recent action history to predict its movement: ACTION3 moved the Color 12 block (and its coupled Color 9 block) left.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Verify the effect of ACTION5 in a new position, potentially discovering its actual behavior or further confirming its lack of effect in various contexts.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. ACTION5 recently had no effect, suggesting that its functionality might be context-dependent or that it has no effect at all. Moving to a new position is crucial for retesting it. Given the descriptions, ACTION3 will move these blocks to the left."
