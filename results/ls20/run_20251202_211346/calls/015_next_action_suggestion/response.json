  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state, so we must first move to a new position. All existing actions (ACTION1-4) are partially validated movement actions, thus we can use them to move. ACTION3 moves the coupled blocks to the left, providing a new position to re-test ACTION5. Testing actions that have not been observed (0/3 consistent) or need more validation is a priority. ACTION5 has had 0/3 consistent observations and 0/8 attempts, making it a high priority action to validate. We also have sufficient information from the recent action history to predict its movement: ACTION3 moved the Color 12 block (and its coupled Color 9 block) left.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify the effect of ACTION5 in a new position, potentially discovering its actual behavior or further confirming its lack of effect in various contexts.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 blocks at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. ACTION5 recently had no effect, suggesting that its functionality might be context-dependent or that it has no effect at all. Moving to a new position is crucial for retesting it. Given the descriptions, ACTION3 will move these blocks to the left."
