  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the rules, I must move the agent (or the coupled blocks in this case) to a new position before trying ACTION5 again. ACTION1 is a partially understood action that reliably moves the coupled blocks upwards. By moving the blocks upwards, I am creating a different state to test ACTION5, which may reveal its functionality if it is context-dependent. Focusing on getting more observations for ACTION5 is a high priority since it has the least number of consistent observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe if ACTION5 has an effect in a different vertical position, helping to determine its function or conditions for activation.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state is suitable for executing ACTION1 as there is space above the coupled blocks. It is not suitable for re-testing ACTION5 directly due to its previous 'no effect' observation in this state."
