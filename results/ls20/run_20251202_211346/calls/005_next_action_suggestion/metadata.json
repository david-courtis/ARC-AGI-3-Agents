    "reasoning": "ACTION3 has no observations yet, making it the highest priority for initial testing to gather foundational knowledge about its effects. Since no actions have 'no effect' recently and we don't know what ACTION3 does, there's no need for a setup sequence.",

    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic, with no pressing environmental constraints or opportunities known that would specifically facilitate or hinder testing ACTION3. It's a good baseline to test a new action."
