  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has no observations yet, making it the highest priority for initial testing to gather foundational knowledge about its effects. Since no actions have 'no effect' recently and we don't know what ACTION3 does, there's no need for a setup sequence.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe the initial effect of ACTION3 and begin to understand its function. This will help us determine if it's a movement action, an interaction action, or something else entirely.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic, with no pressing environmental constraints or opportunities known that would specifically facilitate or hinder testing ACTION3. It's a good baseline to test a new action."
