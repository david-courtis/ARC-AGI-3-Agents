  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves a coupled pair of a Color 12 rectangular block and a Color 9 rectangular block upwards by 8 units. The blocks maintain their relative vertical and horizontal alignment during this movement.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves a specific pair of vertically aligned Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks to the left.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nObjects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 32): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) and Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) appear to be coupled and move together.\n  - ACTION1 causes these coupled blocks to move upwards by 8 units.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had no effect, so we must move to a different position before retrying it. Since none of the movement actions (ACTION1-ACTION4) are verified yet, we should use one that has an effect to change our position. ACTION2 moved the Color 12 block down in a previous attempt, which means it will change the state of the coupled blocks, thus providing a different context for testing ACTION5. Testing ACTION5 now will help us find specific contexts where it might be effective.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By moving to a new position using ACTION2 and then trying ACTION5, we aim to discover if ACTION5 has an effect in a different spatial context or if it remains ineffective. This will help us validate ACTION5's behavior and potentially narrow down its functional conditions.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks that are affected by actions. ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. To properly test ACTION5, we need to alter the position of these blocks."
