  "reasoning": "ACTION5 recently had no effect, so we must move to a different position before retrying it. Since none of the movement actions (ACTION1-ACTION4) are verified yet, we should use one that has an effect to change our position. ACTION2 moved the Color 12 block down in a previous attempt, which means it will change the state of the coupled blocks, thus providing a different context for testing ACTION5. Testing ACTION5 now will help us find specific contexts where it might be effective.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving to a new position using ACTION2 and then trying ACTION5, we aim to discover if ACTION5 has an effect in a different spatial context or if it remains ineffective. This will help us validate ACTION5's behavior and potentially narrow down its functional conditions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the coupled Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular blocks that are affected by actions. ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. To properly test ACTION5, we need to alter the position of these blocks."
