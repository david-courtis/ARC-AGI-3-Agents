  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its previous attempt in the current position. To follow the critical rule of not repeating a no-effect action in the same state, we must first change the position using a known moving action. Since we don't have any VERIFIED actions yet, we will use ACTION1 which has shown a consistent effect in past attempts, thus giving us a high probability of changing the game state. We will then try ACTION5 from this new position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving to a new position before retrying ACTION5, we hope to find a context where it *does* have an effect. This will help us further define ACTION5's behavior and move it towards validation.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows a Color 12 and Color 9 rectangular block at (48, 40) and (50, 40) respectively. ACTION5 previously had no effect in this state. It is crucial to change the position before retesting ACTION5."
