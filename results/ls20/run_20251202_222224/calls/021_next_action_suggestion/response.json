  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 3 consecutive 'no effect' attempts. This strongly suggests it's context-dependent. The rule states: 'If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again in the same state! Instead: Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position.' Since we only have partial knowledge of movement actions, we must use one that has shown an effect. ACTION1 resulted in observable block movement indicating it is a valid movement action. By executing ACTION1, we change the position of the main playable blocks, thereby creating a new context for ACTION5. This could trigger an effect and help us understand its behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the primary blocks using ACTION1 and then attempting ACTION5, we aim to learn if ACTION5's 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' function is dependent on the blocks' vertical position, or proximity to other objects/UI elements that might become active when the main blocks move. This might reveal the conditions under which ACTION5 produces an effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the primary playable blocks (color 12 and 9) in a specific position. There are other dynamic objects and background variations. ACTION5 has consistently shown no effect in this current general positional context. The 'moving object with yellow and black parts' is somewhat elevated, while the 'moving object with purple and black parts' is lower. The main playable blocks are currently in the bottom right corner of the primary play area above the bottom border. A vertical shift will alter their relationship with the environment, potentially enabling ACTION5 to have an effect."
