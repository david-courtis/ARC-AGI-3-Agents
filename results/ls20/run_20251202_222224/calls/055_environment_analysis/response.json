This strongly suggests that a 'NO effect' message in the action log refers to failure to change score, UI, or some other game state, RATHER than a failure of an object to move. The 'MOVED' log takes precedence for object position updates. Thus, 'ACTION3 had NO effect' implies no *secondary* effect occurred, not that the primary movement failed.",
    "Confirmed that 'Playable Block 1' (Color 12) and 'Playable Block 2' (Color 9) successfully moved one unit left, despite the 'NO effect' message for ACTION3. This refines our understanding of what 'no effect' truly means."

It also causes a significant change in the game's background elements and UI, suggesting a phase or level transition, or the loading of a new environment. If the blocks are at the left edge or blocked by an obstacle, their position may not change, but the environmental changes will still occur. The 'NO effect' message indicates failure of secondary effects, not movement failure.",
      "reasoning": "The recent observation shows 'Playable Block 1' and 'Playable Block 2' _did_ move left, despite 'ACTION3 had NO effect'. This redefines 'NO effect' to mean no other game state change (like scoring or UI update) occurred, rather than the primary movement failing. The existing definition needs to be updated to reflect movement success even when 'no effect' is reported."
