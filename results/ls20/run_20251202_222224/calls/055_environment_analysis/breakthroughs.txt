1. Reconciled the 'ACTION3 had NO effect' message with the 'MOVED: 2 objects moved left' log. This strongly suggests that a 'NO effect' message in the action log refers to failure to change score, UI, or some other game state, RATHER than a failure of an object to move. The 'MOVED' log takes precedence for object position updates. Thus, 'ACTION3 had NO effect' implies no *secondary* effect occurred, not that the primary movement failed.
2. Confirmed that 'Playable Block 1' (Color 12) and 'Playable Block 2' (Color 9) successfully moved one unit left, despite the 'NO effect' message for ACTION3. This refines our understanding of what 'no effect' truly means.
