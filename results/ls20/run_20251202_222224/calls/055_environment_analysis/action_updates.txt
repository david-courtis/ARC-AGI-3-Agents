ACTION3: ACTION3 attempts to move the player-controlled block(s) one unit to the left. It also causes a significant change in the game's background elements and UI, suggesting a phase or level transition, or the loading of a new environment. If the blocks are at the left edge or blocked by an obstacle, their position may not change, but the environmental changes will still occur. The 'NO effect' message indicates failure of secondary effects, not movement failure.
  Reason: The recent observation shows 'Playable Block 1' and 'Playable Block 2' _did_ move left, despite 'ACTION3 had NO effect'. This redefines 'NO effect' to mean no other game state change (like scoring or UI update) occurred, rather than the primary movement failing. The existing definition needs to be updated to reflect movement success even when 'no effect' is reported.
