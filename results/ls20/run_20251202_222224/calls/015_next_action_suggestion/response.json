  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state because it was likely attempting to move past the screen boundary. To gather new information, we need to test ACTION5 from a different position. Since no movement actions are fully verified yet, we prioritize actions that have shown a clear effect and move the player-controlled blocks. ACTION3 has successfully moved the blocks to the left. Moving left twice should position the blocks further away from the right boundary, making it a suitable setup to re-test ACTION5, which currently has 0 consistent observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after moving the blocks to the left, we hope to observe an effect and start validating its behavior. This could reveal if ACTION5 is an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action that requires specific proximity to objects, or if it's a movement action (e.g., horizontal movement) that was previously blocked by the screen edge. Obtaining an effect would provide the first step towards its verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player-controlled blocks are currently at a position where ACTION5 previously had no effect. The environment still contains the various identified objects that might be interactable or could influence movement. The current position is not ideal for testing ACTION5 unless it's intended to be a boundary-related action (which it wasn't). Moving left provides a more central testing ground for an interaction or rotation action."
