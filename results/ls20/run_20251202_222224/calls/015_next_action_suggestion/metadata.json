  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves at least two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit upward (decreases their row/y coordinate). It might also update a UI element. This is consistent with the semantic hint 'Move UP (decrease row/y)'.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves selected blocks downwards by one unit. It also causes a change in a single pixel on the top UI, likely an indicator of game state.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the player-controlled block(s) one unit to the left. It also causes a minor change in the top UI, likely a score or timer update.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the primary playable blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit to the right. It also causes a single pixel change in the top UI, likely related to game state (e.g., score, timer).\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 0/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 attempts to move player-controlled blocks horizontally, but was blocked by the implicit screen boundary.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 3 (green)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 8 (red))\n  Description: A single row of Color 8 (red) pixels at the top, spanning almost the entire width, with two Color 11 (orange) blocks next to it. Also a border of Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) at the bottom. The implicit left and right edges of the screen appear to act as boundaries.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  The game appears to have a primary play area with a solid background and distinct top and bottom borders. Objects move freely within this vertical channel with a grid-like movement evident (objects moving by whole units). The top border marks the limit of upward movement, and a bottom border likely limits downward movement. There are also distinct background variations (different shades of green) suggesting zones within the main play area. The left and right edges of the screen define the horizontal boundaries.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified the top border as a solid boundary (Color 8) for upward movement. This is a critical discovery for understanding movement constraints.\n  - Recognized the distinct Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) pattern at the bottom as a probable boundary or 'ground'.\n  - Identified implicit left and right boundaries as the screen edges, as ACTION5 (which likely attempts horizontal movement) had no effect, implying it was attempting to move past the screen edge.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Upward movement is constrained by the Color 8 (red) border at the top of the play area.\n  - Downward movement is likely constrained by the Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) border at the bottom.\n  - Leftward movement is constrained by the left edge of the screen.\n  - Rightward movement is constrained by the right edge of the screen.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - Playable Block 1: Color 12 (purple) Rectangular block (8x2) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)\n  - Playable Block 2: Color 9 (light blue) Rectangular block (8x6) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)\n  - Moving object with purple and black parts: Color 5 (purple) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of purple and black pixels (Role: Secondary player-controlled object or dynamic obstacle/collectible)\n  - Moving object with yellow and black parts: Color 6 (yellow) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of yellow and black pixels (Role: Secondary player-controlled object or dynamic obstacle/collectible)\n  - Top border indicator: Color 8 (red) Single row of pixels (Role: Boundary/stopping point for upward movement)\n  - Top UI elements/score indicators: Color 11 (orange) Two small square blocks (Role: Score or game state indicator)\n  - Bottom border/ground: Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) Interspersed lines of pixels (Role: Boundary or resting surface)\n  - Background variations: Various shades of green (Color 3, Color 10, Color 14) Rectangular areas within the main play area (Role: Aesthetic elements or zone indicators)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What are the precise roles of the irregular objects (yellow/black and purple/black)? Are they also controlled by the player in some way, or are they obstacles/targets?\n  - Does gravity play a role in this environment, or do objects only move when directly acted upon?\n  - What purpose do the different shades of green in the background serve? Are they merely aesthetic, or do they indicate different zones or properties?\n  - What is the significance of the Color 11 (orange) blocks in the top right? Are they part of a scoring mechanism or a counter?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI element: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The game has implicit or explicit left and right boundaries, as objects can move left and right. The current observation suggests no immediate left boundary for the observed objects.\n  - The game has implicit or explicit right boundaries, as objects can move right. The current observation suggests no immediate right boundary for the observed objects at column 32.\n  - The rightmost boundary of the playable area is not yet reached by objects at column 40 or 41.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state because it was likely attempting to move past the screen boundary. To gather new information, we need to test ACTION5 from a different position. Since no movement actions are fully verified yet, we prioritize actions that have shown a clear effect and move the player-controlled blocks. ACTION3 has successfully moved the blocks to the left. Moving left twice should position the blocks further away from the right boundary, making it a suitable setup to re-test ACTION5, which currently has 0 consistent observations.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after moving the blocks to the left, we hope to observe an effect and start validating its behavior. This could reveal if ACTION5 is an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action that requires specific proximity to objects, or if it's a movement action (e.g., horizontal movement) that was previously blocked by the screen edge. Obtaining an effect would provide the first step towards its verification.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The player-controlled blocks are currently at a position where ACTION5 previously had no effect. The environment still contains the various identified objects that might be interactable or could influence movement. The current position is not ideal for testing ACTION5 unless it's intended to be a boundary-related action (which it wasn't). Moving left provides a more central testing ground for an interaction or rotation action."
