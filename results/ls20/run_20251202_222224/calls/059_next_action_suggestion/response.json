  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has seen several 'NO EFFECT' attempts recently, specifically when the blocks were already at the left edge. To properly test ACTION3 and gain more consistent observations, we need to move the 'Playable Block 1' and 'Playable Block 2' to a position where leftward movement is possible. ACTION4 is partially verified and has consistently moved blocks to the right. Therefore, a setup sequence using ACTION4 twice will move the blocks away from the left edge into the play area. This will allow us to test the true effect of ACTION3 (leftward movement) without the constraint of the screen boundary, aiming to get enough consistent observations to verify it.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a successful leftward movement observation for ACTION3, moving the 'Playable Block 1' and 'Playable Block 2' to the left. This should contribute towards verifying ACTION3's consistent effect. We will also observe if any secondary UI changes occur when movement is successful.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Playable Block 1' (Color 12) and 'Playable Block 2' (Color 9) are currently near the left edge of the screen, based on the recent 'NO EFFECT' attempts for ACTION3. This position is not ideal for testing leftward movement. Moving them to the right will provide ample space to observe the effect of ACTION3."
