ACTION3: ACTION3 attempts to move the player-controlled block(s) one unit to the left. If already at the left boundary, it has no visible effect on their position but may trigger other game state changes (e.g., UI updates).
  Reason: The recent observation stated 'ACTION3 had NO effect' simultaneously with 'MOVED: 2 objects ... moved left'. This implies 'NO effect' might mean 'no *further* movement' if already at the boundary, or refers to a different aspect of the game state change, but the blocks were indeed attempting to move left. Given the previous breakthrough confirmed the left edge as a boundary, this suggests ACTION3 tries to move left, is blocked, but the game still logs an 'attempted' movement for the block itself, or the 'NO effect' refers to the overall action impact rather than the individual block movement.
