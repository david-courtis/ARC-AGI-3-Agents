1. Confirmed that ACTION3 can cause 'Playable Block 1' (Color 12) and 'Playable Block 2' (Color 9) to attempt to move left, and their presence at the left edge of the screen, combined with ACTION3 having 'NO effect', reaffirms the left screen edge as an impassable boundary. However, the game state change log shows these two blocks actually 'MOVED' left, indicating a potential contradiction or a more nuanced behavior of ACTION3 where it attempts to move and is blocked, but the movement log might reflect an attempted move rather than an actual change in position from its previous state.
