  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has had `NO EFFECT` in recent attempts, indicating the primary blocks were at a boundary or blocked. To properly test ACTION3 and gain more consistent observations (currently 0/3 consistent), we need to move the blocks away from the left edge. ACTION4 is the best choice for the `setup_sequence` because it reliably moves the primary blocks to the right. By moving right first, we create space to test ACTION3's leftward movement. This will help us clarify the conditions under which ACTION3 effects or fails to effect, and work towards its verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe ACTION3 successfully moving the primary blocks (Color 12 and Color 9) to the left, which will contribute to verifying its behavior and completing its knowledge. We will also learn if the background/UI changes previously observed with ACTION3 are tied to the block's movement or simply triggering an environmental change regardless of movement success. Finally, we'll confirm that ACTION3's 'NO EFFECT' status was indeed due to a boundary constraint.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The primary blocks (Color 12 and Color 9) appear to be near the left edge of the screen, as suggested by the recent 'NO EFFECT' for ACTION3. The environment seems dynamic with varying background colors and UI elements. The presence of other irregular blocks (yellow/black and purple/black) suggests potential interactions or obstacles, but their roles are still unclear."
