  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The action was applied in a context where the two primary interactive blocks (color 12 rectangular block at (40, 48) and color 9 rectangular block at (42, 48)) were present and seemingly accessible, but there was no observable 'interact', 'select', or 'rotate' action that could be performed or result in a visible change. There were no adjacent objects for interaction, nor does their current shape suggest a rotational capability that would yield a visible change in this specific configuration. The blocks were at a new column position (48) but this didn't provide a context for ACTION5 to have an effect. The 'semantic hint' of 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' suggests that this action is highly context-dependent and requires specific conditions (e.g., an interactable object nearby, a rotatable object in a specific orientation) that were not met in this observation.",
