  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect in recent attempts (7 consecutive no-effects), indicating the current game state is not suitable for testing it. Before re-attempting ACTION5, we must first change the position of the player-controlled blocks. Since no actions are fully verified, we will use ACTION3, which has shown to move blocks to the left. Moving further left will change the context for ACTION5. After moving, we will retest ACTION5 to see if this new position and potential proximity to other objects (like the 'L' shaped purple/black object at the bottom-left) enables it to have an effect. We will perform two ACTION3 movements to ensure a significant change in position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the player blocks to a new position using ACTION3 and then retesting ACTION5, we hope to observe an effect of ACTION5. This would help us understand the specific contextual conditions or objects required for ACTION5 to trigger, moving it closer to verification. If it still has no effect, we will confirm it is not triggered by mere horizontal position changes and might require interaction with specific objects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state has the primary playable blocks (color 12 and color 9) somewhat centered. ACTION5 has repeatedly shown no effect from this general position. There's a distinct purple/black 'L' shaped object in the bottom-left corner which might be targetable by an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action. Moving closer to this object might provide a suitable context for ACTION5."
