  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had 'no effect' in previous attempts. A critical rule states that if an action had no effect, we MUST move first before re-testing it. Since ACTION4 has 1 consistent observation, it's a good candidate for part of a setup sequence to move the primary blocks to a new location, specifically to the left where there's ample space. As we still need to gather more data on ACTION3 and it is likely a movement action, using it to move left seems like a good strategy. By moving the player-controlled blocks closer to the left edge of the visible area (and potentially near the 'purple L-shape' block), we are changing the 'context' for ACTION5. This might reveal its functionality as an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action, as it could potentially interact with or rotate the primary blocks or another object.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 after a significant change in position, we hope to observe an actual effect. This could involve rotation of the primary blocks (color 12 and 9), interaction with the 'purple L-shape' block or the 'yellow square' block, or even selection of one of the primary blocks for subsequent movement. This would allow us to begin validating ACTION5's definition and understand its contextual triggers.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The primary player-controlled blocks (color 12 and 9) are currently in the mid-right portion of the screen. There's a 'purple L-shape' object at the bottom-left and a 'yellow square' object above it, both potentially interactive. The previous attempts of ACTION5 resulted in no effect, suggesting that its functionality is context-dependent and the current position doesn't offer that context. Moving the primary blocks to a different section of the screen, particularly towards other objects or boundaries, is crucial for exploring its hidden behavior."
