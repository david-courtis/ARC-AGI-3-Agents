  "reasoning": "ACTION3 had a 'NO EFFECT' observation in its last attempt because the object was blocked by the left edge of the screen. To effectively test ACTION3's leftward movement, we must first move the player-controlled block(s) away from the left edge. Since ACTION4 moves the blocks to the right and has some consistency (2/3), it's a suitable setup action to create a new state for testing ACTION3. By moving right, we create space to test leftward movement. This adheres to the critical rule of not repeating a no-effect action in the same state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the effect of ACTION3 moving the player-controlled block(s) to the left, which would validate its definition and contribute to its verification. We also hope to see if any UI elements change during this movement, similar to previous observations.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The primary player-controlled blocks are currently at a position where further leftward movement is blocked by the screen edge, thus making it a bad state to test ACTION3 directly. Moving right will enable us to test ACTION3 meaningfully."
