  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has had a 'NO EFFECT' recently, meaning it did not change the game state when tried in its previous position. To adhere to the critical rules, we must first change the position of the player-controlled blocks. We know ACTION4 (Move RIGHT) has been observed to move blocks to the right. Therefore, by performing ACTION4 twice, we move the blocks to a new position, away from the left edge where ACTION3 previously had no effect. This allows us to retest ACTION3 for leftward movement in a different context, aiming to understand its behavior when not at a boundary or to confirm its boundary interaction if it still fails.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION3 (Move LEFT) causes the blocks to move left from a non-boundary position. This will help us confirm its primary function, whether its previous 'NO EFFECT' was due to a boundary, or if it indeed triggers other environmental changes consistently, even when movement is blocked. We also hope to gain more consistent observations for ACTION3.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the primary blocks (Color 12 and Color 9) at column 32 and 40 respectively, based on the last known effective action. There are other dynamic objects present. The background changed to green, and new UI elements are visible. The primary blocks are not at the extreme left edge, so moving right twice should further distance them from any potential left boundary, creating a good condition to retest leftward movement."
