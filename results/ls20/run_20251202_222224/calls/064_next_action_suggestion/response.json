  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 is currently at 1/3 consistent observations and needs more validation. It is the action with the fewest consistent observations among the pending actions. Additionally, the recent observations and the 'no-effect' interpretation clarification for ACTION3 suggest that object movement can still occur even if 'no effect' is reported for secondary game state changes. We need to focus on validating primary effects.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to get a second consistent observation for ACTION1 to bring it closer to verification. Specifically, we want to confirm its effect on 'Playable Block 1' (Color 12) and 'Playable Block 2' (Color 9) and observe any associated UI changes. This will also help confirm the limits of upward movement based on the identified top border.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Playable Block 1' and 'Playable Block 2' are currently positioned in a central-lower part of the screen, far from the top border, making it a good state to test upward movement with ACTION1 without immediate boundary collision. There are no immediate obstacles above them based on the current image."
