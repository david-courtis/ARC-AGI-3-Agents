  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 had no effect in the previous turn because its movement was blocked by the left screen edge. Repeating a 'no-effect' action in the same state is counterproductive. Instead, we should test an action that has remaining validation attempts and is not blocked by a boundary. ACTION4 has not been fully verified (1/3 consistent) and should attempt to move the playable blocks to the right. There appears to be ample space to the right for the blocks to move, making this a good state to test ACTION4.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to validate whether ACTION4 consistently moves the playable blocks to the right by one unit. This will contribute to its verification (2/3 consistent). If it successfully moves the blocks, it also potentially creates a new state to re-test ACTION3 or ACTION5 from a different position.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The playable blocks are located at the bottom-left of the main play area, making the immediate left boundary blocked if ACTION3 is attempted. There is sufficient space to the right to move. No immediate interactive elements are evident for ACTION5, so focusing on movement actions to explore the space is a priority."
