  "reasoning": "ACTION4 is one of the two actions that have never been observed before. Testing unobserved actions is the highest priority. The current state appears to be good for testing horizontal movement, as the main interactive objects are centrally located and not against any known boundaries, allowing for clear observation of its effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To determine if ACTION4 moves the player-controlled blocks RIGHT (increases column/x), consistent with the semantic hint, and to observe if any other UI elements or objects are affected. This will provide the first observation for ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows the primary movable objects (purple and light blue blocks) in a central position, not constrained by left or right boundaries (as far as we know for sure yet). This provides a good opportunity to observe the effect of a rightward movement action. The top and bottom boundaries are well understood, and the immediate area around the movable objects is clear."
