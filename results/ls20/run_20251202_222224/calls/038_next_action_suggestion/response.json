  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has the least validation (0/3 consistent observations) and has not been tested for a while. We are currently in a state where the primary blocks are not at the very bottom, so we can test its downward movement without immediate collision with the bottom border. Since ACTION1 recently showed an effect and modified the position of the blocks, this is a new state compared to the last time ACTION2 was tested, making it valid to attempt ACTION2 again. We have no verified actions, so we cannot use a setup sequence yet. Critically, ACTION5 is exhausted and therefore should not be tested under any circumstances.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION2 consistently moves the primary blocks downwards by one unit or if there are other effects. This will help us get closer to verifying ACTION2's definition and understanding its behavior, especially in a new spatial context.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The primary blocks (color 12 and color 9) are in a central position, not constrained by any borders for downward movement. This state is suitable for testing downward movement (ACTION2). There are other dynamic objects and background elements, but they do not seem to immediately interfere with the primary blocks' potential actions."
