  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently had no effect due to likely context-dependency. We need to focus on actions that have not yet been fully validated. ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 all only have 1 attempt each and are not yet consistent. ACTION4 has 2 attempts and is 1/3 consistent. To avoid repeating a no-effect action in the same state, we should prioritize actions that are not 'EXHAUSTED' and have the fewest observations, to try and get them verified. ACTION1 has only been attempted once and is not yet consistent. Since there is ample space above the player-controlled blocks and no immediate top boundary nearby to block movement, this is a good state to test ACTION1.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the specific blocks (color 12 and 9) moving upwards by one unit and the potential UI element update. This will help us build consistency towards verifying ACTION1.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows the primary playable blocks (Color 12 and Color 9) in the lower-middle part of the screen, with significant open space above them. This is an ideal setup for testing upward movement. There are no obvious obstacles or boundaries immediately above the blocks that would prevent ACTION1 from having an effect."
