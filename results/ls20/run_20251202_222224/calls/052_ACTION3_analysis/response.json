  "interpretation": "The two primary blocks, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40), moved one unit to the left. The `BACKGROUND` of the game changed significantly, with many previously unobserved objects appearing and the overall color scheme shifting from orange to a variety of greens. A red dotted line appeared at the top of the UI and orange/green squares and some green pixels appeared at the bottom and top UI, respectively. A block of color 4 (8x16) appeared at (16,16) and a large irregular shape of color 4 (64x64) appeared at (0,0).",

  "new_definition": "ACTION3 attempts to move the player-controlled block(s) one unit to the left. This action also causes a significant change in the game's background elements and UI, suggesting a phase or level transition, or the loading of a new environment. If the blocks are at the left edge or blocked by an obstacle, their position may not change, but the environmental changes will still occur.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": false,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The action was applied to a game state where the main blocks were located at (48, 40) and (50, 40), neither at the left edge nor blocked. This allowed for horizontal movement. Additionally, the execution of ACTION3 seems to trigger a global environmental/level change, as evidenced by the mass appearance of new objects and changes in background color, alongside the UI updates. This contradicts previous 'NO EFFECT' observations of ACTION3 from the analysis. However, it is possible that the context from the previous analysis is different to this one; the previous analysis may have omitted the details of objects appearing, which happened in this frame and was reported by the object-level analysis.",
