Given the previous observation of ACTION3 having no effect at column 16, and now no effect at column 24, it strongly suggests that the blocks are being prevented from moving left. This could be due to an invisible boundary, an obstacle not identified by the current object detection, or a conditional constraint where left movement is not allowed beyond a certain point relative to the game state or background elements. The specific objects at (16,32) and (18,34) on the left side of the play area could be acting as an obstacle, but they weren't identified before. The 'lower_left_playarea' bounding box in 'Regions Affected' and the 'lower_left_playarea' in 'BACKGROUND' from the previous analysis for ACTION3 (HAD EFFECT at column 32) indicates that movement is possible in that area. However, there are also 'Color 4: 8x16 block at row 16, col 16', 'Color 9: 3x3 block at row 54, col 1' objects that could act as a boundary or obstacle, specifically near column 16. In this frame, the blocks are at column 24. While the context states the blocks are at column '24', the 'Objects BEFORE ACTION' lists them at col '24'. In the BEFORE image, specifically, there's a large block 'Color 4: 8x16 block at row 16, col 16', and a small purple 'Color 9: 3x3 block at row 54, col 1' at the left edge. The current block is at row 40, col 24. The previous analysis where it had no effect was at col 16, where these blocks were physically next to the 'Color 4' block. At column 24, they are not directly next to 'Color 4' (at 16). This suggests there is a region or invisible wall to the left of column 24. The bounding box of the regions affected, 'cols [16-40]' (for the previous 'had effect' at col 32), and 'cols [16-30]' (for the previous 'had effect' at col 16), seem to indicate a left column boundary of 16 to the affected region.
