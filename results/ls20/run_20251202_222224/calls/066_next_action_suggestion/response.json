  "reasoning": "ACTION3 had an effect on block movement but a 'NO EFFECT' on secondary game state in its last few attempts. To get more validation for its 'no secondary effect' behavior, we need to test it in a different position. Since ACTION4 is verified and moves blocks to the right, using it twice will ensure a significant change in the x-coordinate, moving the playable blocks away from the current far-left edge to a new position. This new position will be far enough to avoid immediate re-encountering the left boundary and will allow us to observe if ACTION3 still results in a 'NO EFFECT' for secondary actions, but movement for blocks.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm that ACTION3 *always* moves the playable blocks to the left and *never* produces a secondary effect (like UI change or score update), regardless of its starting position (as long as it's not at the very edge). If a secondary effect occurs, we will need to update its definition. This also contributes to validating ACTION3's consistent behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The playable blocks (purple and light blue) are currently towards the left side of the screen. The new position after two ACTION4s will place them more centrally, allowing clear leftward movement without immediately hitting the boundary, which is optimal for re-testing ACTION3's effects on movement and secondary indicators."
