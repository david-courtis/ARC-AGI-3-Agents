  "reasoning": "ACTION2 (Move DOWN) has never been observed, making it the highest priority for testing. We have successfully tested ACTION1 (Move UP) which primarily moved two blocks. Observing the effect of ACTION2 will directly test its hypothesized opposite, 'Move DOWN', and provide crucial information about vertical movement mechanics in the game. Trying it in the current state is good as the main playable blocks are not at the bottom border, leaving room for downward movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "This action is expected to reveal how the primary game elements (the color 12 and color 9 blocks, and possibly others) move downwards. We will observe if it's a single unit movement, if other objects are affected, and if there are any restrictions or interactions with the bottom border (Color 0 and Color 7) or the different shades of green in the background. It will also help us determine if the 'Move DOWN' semantic hint is accurate.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing ACTION2. The main playable blocks (color 12 and color 9) are in the middle part of the screen, with ample space below them and above the bottom border. This allows for observing any downward movement without immediate collision with a border. There are no immediate contextual elements that would specifically prevent or alter a downward movement action that we know of yet."
