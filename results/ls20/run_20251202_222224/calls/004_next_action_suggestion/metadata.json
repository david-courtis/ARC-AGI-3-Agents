  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves at least two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit upward (decreases their row/y coordinate). It might also update a UI element. This is consistent with the semantic hint 'Move UP (decrease row/y)'.\n  ACTION2: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 3 (green)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 8 (red))\n  Description: A single row of Color 8 pixels at the top, spanning almost the entire width, with two Color 11 (orange) blocks next to it. This top border acts as a wall, preventing upward movement past a certain point. There's also a border of Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) at the bottom.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  The game appears to have a primary play area with a solid background and distinct top and bottom borders. Objects move freely within this vertical channel with a grid-like movement evident (objects moving by whole units). The top border marks the limit of upward movement, and a bottom border likely limits downward movement. There are also distinct background variations (different shades of green) suggesting zones within the main play area.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified the top border as a solid boundary (Color 8) for upward movement. This is a critical discovery for understanding movement constraints.\n  - Recognized the distinct Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) pattern at the bottom as a probable boundary or 'ground'.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Upward movement is constrained by the Color 8 (red) border at the top of the play area.\n  - Downward movement is likely constrained by the Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) border at the bottom.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - Playable Block 1: Color 12 (purple) Rectangular block (8x2) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)\n  - Playable Block 2: Color 9 (light blue) Rectangular block (8x6) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)\n  - Moving object with purple and black parts: Color 5 (purple) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of purple and black pixels (Role: Secondary player-controlled object or dynamic obstacle/collectible)\n  - Moving object with yellow and black parts: Color 6 (yellow) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of yellow and black pixels (Role: Secondary player-controlled object or dynamic obstacle/collectible)\n  - Top border indicator: Color 8 (red) Single row of pixels (Role: Boundary/stopping point for upward movement)\n  - Top UI elements/score indicators: Color 11 (orange) Two small square blocks (Role: Score or game state indicator)\n  - Bottom border/ground: Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) Interspersed lines of pixels (Role: Boundary or resting surface)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What defines the left and right boundaries of the play area? Are they implicitly the edges of the screen, or are there invisible walls or specific colors?\n  - What are the precise roles of the irregular objects (yellow/black and purple/black)? Are they also controlled by the player in some way, or are they obstacles/targets?\n  - Does gravity play a role in this environment, or do objects only move when directly acted upon?\n  - What purpose do the different shades of green in the background serve? Are they merely aesthetic, or do they indicate different zones or properties?\n  - What is the significance of the Color 11 (orange) blocks in the top right? Are they part of a scoring mechanism or a counter?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state!

    "reasoning": "ACTION2 (Move DOWN) has never been observed, making it the highest priority for testing. We have successfully tested ACTION1 (Move UP) which primarily moved two blocks. Observing the effect of ACTION2 will directly test its hypothesized opposite, 'Move DOWN', and provide crucial information about vertical movement mechanics in the game. Trying it in the current state is good as the main playable blocks are not at the bottom border, leaving room for downward movement.",
    "expected_information_gain": "This action is expected to reveal how the primary game elements (the color 12 and color 9 blocks, and possibly others) move downwards. We will observe if it's a single unit movement, if other objects are affected, and if there are any restrictions or interactions with the bottom border (Color 0 and Color 7) or the different shades of green in the background. It will also help us determine if the 'Move DOWN' semantic hint is accurate.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing ACTION2. The main playable blocks (color 12 and color 9) are in the middle part of the screen, with ample space below them and above the bottom border. This allows for observing any downward movement without immediate collision with a border. There are no immediate contextual elements that would specifically prevent or alter a downward movement action that we know of yet."
