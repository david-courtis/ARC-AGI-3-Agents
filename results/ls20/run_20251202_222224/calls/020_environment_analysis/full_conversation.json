How do you know?\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nBe a detective.

        "text": "Analyze the environment in this game frame.\n\nWHAT JUST HAPPENED:\nACTION5 had NO effect: The action ACTION5 had no visible effect on the game state. The two main interactive blocks (color 1\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBackground: Color 3 (green)\nBorder: Yes (Color 8 (red), Color 0 (black), Color 7 (light green), implicit left/right) - A single row of Color 8 (red) pixels at the very top, spanning most of the width. A bottom border composed of interspersed lines of Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) pixels. The far left and far right edges of the screen act as impassable boundaries.\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - Upward movement is constrained by the Color 8 (red) border at the top of the play area.\n  - Downward movement is likely constrained by the Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) border at the bottom.\n  - Leftward movement is constrained by the left edge of the screen.\n  - Rightward movement is constrained by the right edge of the screen.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Playable Block 1: Color 12 (purple) Rectangular block (8x2 pixels) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)\n  - Playable Block 2: Color 9 (light blue) Rectangular block (8x6 pixels) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)\n  - Moving object with purple and black parts: Color 5 (purple) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of purple and black pixels (L-shape in this frame) (Role: Dynamic obstacle or secondary player-controlled object/collectible)\n  - Moving object with yellow and black parts: Color 6 (yellow) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of yellow and black pixels (block with a short line below) (Role: Dynamic obstacle or secondary player-controlled object/collectible)\n  - Top border indicator: Color 8 (red) Single row of pixels (Role: Boundary/stopping point for upward movement)\n  - Top UI elements/score indicators: Color 11 (orange) Two small square blocks (Role: Score or game state indicator)\n  - Bottom border/ground: Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) Interspersed lines of pixels (Role: Boundary or resting surface)\n  - Background variations: Color 3 (green), Color 10 (light green), Color 14 (dark green) Rectangular areas within the main play area (Role: Aesthetic elements or zone indicators)\nSpatial structure: The game has a primary vertical play area defined by solid top and bottom borders and implicit left and right screen edges. Within this area, there are rectangular zones of varying shades of green. Objects exhibit grid-like movement.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Identified the top border as a solid boundary (Color 8) for upward movement. This is a critical discovery for understanding movement constraints.\n- Recognized the distinct Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) pattern at the bottom as a probable boundary or 'ground'.\n- Identified implicit left and right boundaries as the screen edges, as ACTION5 (which likely attempts horizontal movement) had no effect, implying it was attempting to move past the screen edge.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What are the precise roles of the irregular objects (yellow/black and purple/black)? Are they also controlled by the player in some way, or are they obstacles/targets?\n- Does gravity play a role in this environment, or do objects only move when directly acted upon?\n- What purpose do the different shades of green in the background serve? Are they merely aesthetic, or do they indicate different zones or properties?\n- What is the significance of the Color 11 (orange) blocks in the top right? Are they part of a scoring mechanism or a counter?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS:\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 moves at least two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit upward (decreases their row/y coordinate). It might also update a UI element. This is consistent with the semantic hint 'Move UP (decrease row/y)'.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 moves selected blocks downwards by one unit. It also causes a change in a single pixel on the top UI, likely an indicator of game state.\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 moves the player-controlled block(s) one unit to the left. It also causes a minor change in the top UI, likely a score or timer update.\"\n  ACTION4: \"ACTION4 moves the primary playable blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit to the right. It also causes a single pixel change in the top UI, likely related to game state (e.g., score, timer).\"\n  ACTION5: \"ACTION5 is an action that attempts to 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' at the current position, but its effect is not universally applicable or is context-dependent. It has no discernible effect when the relevant player blocks are not in a specific state or position that allows for interaction, rotation, or selection that would produce a visible change.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n\nIf a movement action had NO EFFECT, the most likely reason is a WALL or BOUNDARY.\nLook carefully at the edges and any patterns that might indicate walls.\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf you have new questions to investigate, list them.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE in the new understanding\n\nDo NOT suggest updates for:\n- Minor refinements or rewording\n- Adding detail that doesn't change the core meaning\n- Speculation without strong evidence\n\nIf you DO suggest an update, keep it SIMPLE and CONCEPTUAL, e.g.:\n- \"moves player up, blocked by Color 0 walls\"\n- \"moves right within bounded play area\"\n- \"interacts with adjacent objects\"\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
