  "interpretation": "Two blocks, a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40), moved one unit to the right. A single pixel in the top UI changed, likely indicating a game state change (e.g., score, timer).",

  "new_definition": "ACTION4 moves the primary playable blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit to the right. It also causes a single pixel change in the top UI, likely related to game state (e.g., score, timer).",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The action was applied to the game state where the color 12 block at (48, 40) and the color 9 block at (50, 40) were present. They were not at the rightmost boundary of the play area nor blocked by other objects directly to their right, enabling them to move right. Their previous position was (48, 32) and (50, 32) (based on the provided objects, the 'at' coordinate for color 12 was (48, 40) and color 9 was (50, 40), which implies they moved from col 32 to col 40, a net movement of 1 unit right according to the prompt description, but visually the blocks are at col 40 and then col 41 after the move, consistent with a rightward movement. The 'Objects changed' section seems to report the original position as the `at` coordinate, and the description reports the movement. Comparing the 'before' image (col 40 and 40) and 'after' image (col 41 and 41), they did move one unit right).",
