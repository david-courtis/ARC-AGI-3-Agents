However, given the semantic hint 'Move LEFT (decrease column/x)', it is highly likely that these blocks were already at the leftmost boundary of the playable area, or were blocked by an immovable object to their left. The provided object list shows the blocks at column 16, which is a position very close to the left edge (column 0). The lack of any pixel changes, even in the UI, supports the conclusion that the action could not be performed.",
