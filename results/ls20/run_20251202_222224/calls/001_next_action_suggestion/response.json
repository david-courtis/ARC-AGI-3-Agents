  "reasoning": "All actions are unknown. Prioritize testing movement actions to understand basic spatial navigation. Starting with ACTION1 (Move UP) is an arbitrary but systematic choice. There's no immediate reason to perform a setup sequence as the current position and surroundings are unknown; any movement attempt is equally valid for initial observation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover if ACTION1 moves the agent up, if it's blocked by the top border or other objects, or if it has another unexpected effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Initial state. Agent is in a central area of a green background. There are some distinct colored blocks and patterns (yellow/black, purple/black, blue/purple) which may be interactive or obstacles. A line of red dots is at the top border and a line of green/dark green dots is at the bottom border. Two orange squares are in the top right. The overall layout suggests a navigable environment."
