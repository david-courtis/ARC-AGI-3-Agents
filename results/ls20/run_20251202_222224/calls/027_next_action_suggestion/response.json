  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 5 consecutive 'no effect' outcomes. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different state before retrying ACTION5. Since no actions are yet 'verified' for setup sequences, we must use actions that have shown a consistent effect, even if not fully verified (3/3). ACTION4 has 1/3 consistent observations and 2 attempts without a no-effect outcome, indicating it is likely a reliable movement action. Moving right twice will change the position of the primary playable blocks, which might create a new context where ACTION5 might have an effect. By moving the blocks to a new location, we explore if ACTION5's effect is context-dependent, such as requiring interaction with a specific boundary or object.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe an effect from ACTION5. If it still produces no effect, it will further confirm its context-dependent nature and narrow down possible contexts for its functionality (e.g., perhaps it requires a specific object to be nearby, not just any new position). If it does have an effect, we will begin to understand its true function (INTERACT, SELECT, ROTATE) and under what conditions it operates.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows the primary playable blocks (color 12 and 9) in a central position. There are other objects present (yellow/black and purple/black irregular shapes) but not in direct contact with the player blocks. The repeated 'no effect' of ACTION5 strongly suggests that its function is context-dependent and that the current position/configuration does not provide the necessary context. Moving the player blocks horizontally, away from the current position and potentially closer to another game object or a different area of the board, is a strategic step to attempt to trigger ACTION5's effect."
