  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has only been attempted once and is not yet verified. Given that the previous attempt of ACTION4 resulted in an effect, it's a good candidate to test again immediately to gather more observations towards verification. The current state does not appear to be constrained for rightward movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further observation of ACTION4's effects, specifically how it moves the current player-controlled blocks and any associated UI changes. This will help in getting closer to verifying ACTION4's behavior.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the purple and light blue blocks, which are likely player-controlled, centered enough to allow for rightward movement without immediately hitting a boundary, making it suitable for testing ACTION4 again."
