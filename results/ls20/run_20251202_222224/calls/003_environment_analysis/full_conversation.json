BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay."

Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (128), top_ui (1) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [2-55], cols [2-47]\n\nObject-level changes: MOVED: 2 objects\n  ~ Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40) moved up\n  ~ Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40) moved up\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBorder: Unknown or none detected\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\nNone yet\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\nNone yet\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS:\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 moves at least two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit upward (decreases their row/y coordinate). It might also update a UI element. This is consistent with the semantic hint 'Move UP (decrease row/y)'.\"\n  ACTION2: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION3: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n\nIf a movement action had NO EFFECT, the most likely reason is a WALL or BOUNDARY.\nLook carefully at the edges and any patterns that might indicate walls.\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf you have new questions to investigate, list them.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE in the new understanding\n\nDo NOT suggest updates for:\n- Minor refinements or rewording\n- Adding detail that doesn't change the core meaning\n- Speculation without strong evidence\n\nIf you DO suggest an update, keep it SIMPLE and CONCEPTUAL, e.g.:\n- \"moves player up, blocked by Color 0 walls\"\n- \"moves right within bounded play area\"\n- \"interacts with adjacent objects\"\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
