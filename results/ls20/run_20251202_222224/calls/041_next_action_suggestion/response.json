  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has only been attempted once and is currently 0/3 consistent, making it a high priority for further testing to understand its behavior. The current position allows for leftward movement as the 'Playable Block 1' (color 12, purple) is not at the extreme left edge of the screen. We want to validate its effect on the main controlled blocks and see if the UI change is consistent. Since ACTION3 has had very few attempts, there is no need for a setup sequence to change position at this point.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify the consistent effect of ACTION3 (moving blocks left) and observe the type and consistency of the UI changes it causes. This will help us get closer to verifying ACTION3.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows the 'Playable Block 1' (purple) and 'Playable Block 2' (light blue) centrally located in the play area, with ample space to move left. The top UI elements are visible. This is a suitable state to test leftward movement and observe any related UI changes."
