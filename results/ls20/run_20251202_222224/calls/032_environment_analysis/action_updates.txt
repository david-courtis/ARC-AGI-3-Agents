ACTION5: Attempts to 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' at the current position, but its effect is context-dependent and only occurs when relevant player blocks are in a valid state or position for interaction, rotation, or selection.
  Reason: The consistent observation of 'NO effect' for ACTION5 across multiple attempts, coupled with the previous hypothesis of 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE', strongly suggests its effect is conditional. The environment provides no visual cues for interaction in this frame.
