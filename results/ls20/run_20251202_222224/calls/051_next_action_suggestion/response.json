  "reasoning": "ACTION3 had a 'NO EFFECT' in the last attempt, implying it was at a boundary. To properly test ACTION3 and gather more information for its verification, we need to move the playable blocks away from the left boundary. ACTION4 has 2/3 consistency and has been observed to move blocks to the right. Executing ACTION4 twice will likely move the blocks significantly enough to the right to allow for another test of ACTION3, and potentially observe its effect or another boundary.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the blocks to the right and then attempting ACTION3, we expect to either observe a successful leftward movement of the blocks, which would contribute to verifying ACTION3, or identify a new, more central leftward boundary if movement is still blocked. This will help us understand the conditions under which ACTION3 is effective and the full scope of its function.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state has 'Playable Block 1' (Color 12) and 'Playable Block 2' (Color 9) located at a position where previous attempts to move left (ACTION3) resulted in 'NO EFFECT'. This suggests the blocks are at or very near the left boundary. The other irregular objects are also present."
