  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The action was applied in a context where the two primary interactive blocks (color 12 rectangular block at (40, 48) and color 9 rectangular block at (42, 48)) were present and seemingly accessible. However, no specific 'interact', 'select', or 'rotate' action was possible or relevant to produce a visible change. There were no adjacent objects for interaction, nor does their current shape or position suggest a rotational capability that would yield a visible change in this specific configuration. This confirms the previous observations that ACTION5 is highly context-dependent and requires specific conditions not met here.",
