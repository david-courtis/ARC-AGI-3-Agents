Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves at least two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit upward (decreases their row/y coordinate). It might also update a UI element. This is consistent with the semantic hint 'Move UP (decrease row/y)'.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves selected blocks downwards by one unit. It also causes a change in a single pixel on the top UI, likely an indicator of game state.
  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 3 (green)

BORDER: Yes (Color 8 (red))
  Description: A single row of Color 8 pixels at the top, spanning almost the entire width, with two Color 11 (orange) blocks next to it. This top border acts as a wall, preventing upward movement past a certain point. There's also a border of Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) at the bottom.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  The game appears to have a primary play area with a solid background and distinct top and bottom borders. Objects move freely within this vertical channel with a grid-like movement evident (objects moving by whole units). The top border marks the limit of upward movement, and a bottom border likely limits downward movement. There are also distinct background variations (different shades of green) suggesting zones within the main play area.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified the top border as a solid boundary (Color 8) for upward movement. This is a critical discovery for understanding movement constraints.
  - Recognized the distinct Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) pattern at the bottom as a probable boundary or 'ground'.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Upward movement is constrained by the Color 8 (red) border at the top of the play area.
  - Downward movement is likely constrained by the Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) border at the bottom.

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - Playable Block 1: Color 12 (purple) Rectangular block (8x2) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)
  - Playable Block 2: Color 9 (light blue) Rectangular block (8x6) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)
  - Moving object with purple and black parts: Color 5 (purple) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of purple and black pixels (Role: Secondary player-controlled object or dynamic obstacle/collectible)
  - Moving object with yellow and black parts: Color 6 (yellow) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of yellow and black pixels (Role: Secondary player-controlled object or dynamic obstacle/collectible)
  - Top border indicator: Color 8 (red) Single row of pixels (Role: Boundary/stopping point for upward movement)
  - Top UI elements/score indicators: Color 11 (orange) Two small square blocks (Role: Score or game state indicator)
  - Bottom border/ground: Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) Interspersed lines of pixels (Role: Boundary or resting surface)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What defines the left and right boundaries of the play area? Are they implicitly the edges of the screen, or are there invisible walls or specific colors?
  - What are the precise roles of the irregular objects (yellow/black and purple/black)? Are they also controlled by the player in some way, or are they obstacles/targets?
  - Does gravity play a role in this environment, or do objects only move when directly acted upon?
  - What purpose do the different shades of green in the background serve? Are they merely aesthetic, or do they indicate different zones or properties?
  - What is the significance of the Color 11 (orange) blocks in the top right? Are they part of a scoring mechanism or a counter?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Top UI element: Involved in ACTION2 action
