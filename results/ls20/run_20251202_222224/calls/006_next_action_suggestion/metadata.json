  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves at least two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit upward (decreases their row/y coordinate). It might also update a UI element. This is consistent with the semantic hint 'Move UP (decrease row/y)'.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves selected blocks downwards by one unit. It also causes a change in a single pixel on the top UI, likely an indicator of game state.\n  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 3 (green)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 8 (red))\n  Description: A single row of Color 8 pixels at the top, spanning almost the entire width, with two Color 11 (orange) blocks next to it. This top border acts as a wall, preventing upward movement past a certain point. There's also a border of Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) at the bottom.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  The game appears to have a primary play area with a solid background and distinct top and bottom borders. Objects move freely within this vertical channel with a grid-like movement evident (objects moving by whole units). The top border marks the limit of upward movement, and a bottom border likely limits downward movement. There are also distinct background variations (different shades of green) suggesting zones within the main play area.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified the top border as a solid boundary (Color 8) for upward movement. This is a critical discovery for understanding movement constraints.\n  - Recognized the distinct Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) pattern at the bottom as a probable boundary or 'ground'.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Upward movement is constrained by the Color 8 (red) border at the top of the play area.\n  - Downward movement is likely constrained by the Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) border at the bottom.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - Playable Block 1: Color 12 (purple) Rectangular block (8x2) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)\n  - Playable Block 2: Color 9 (light blue) Rectangular block (8x6) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)\n  - Moving object with purple and black parts: Color 5 (purple) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of purple and black pixels (Role: Secondary player-controlled object or dynamic obstacle/collectible)\n  - Moving object with yellow and black parts: Color 6 (yellow) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of yellow and black pixels (Role: Secondary player-controlled object or dynamic obstacle/collectible)\n  - Top border indicator: Color 8 (red) Single row of pixels (Role: Boundary/stopping point for upward movement)\n  - Top UI elements/score indicators: Color 11 (orange) Two small square blocks (Role: Score or game state indicator)\n  - Bottom border/ground: Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) Interspersed lines of pixels (Role: Boundary or resting surface)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What defines the left and right boundaries of the play area? Are they implicitly the edges of the screen, or are there invisible walls or specific colors?\n  - What are the precise roles of the irregular objects (yellow/black and purple/black)? Are they also controlled by the player in some way, or are they obstacles/targets?\n  - Does gravity play a role in this environment, or do objects only move when directly acted upon?\n  - What purpose do the different shades of green in the background serve? Are they merely aesthetic, or do they indicate different zones or properties?\n  - What is the significance of the Color 11 (orange) blocks in the top right? Are they part of a scoring mechanism or a counter?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI element: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration.

    "reasoning": "ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5 have not been observed yet, making them the highest priority for testing. Since the two previous actions were vertical movements, it's strategic to explore horizontal movement next to understand the full movement capabilities of the playable blocks. There are no current state limitations preventing the testing of ACTION3, unlike being near a boundary with vertical movement. The current position allows testing horizontal movement without immediate collisions.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION3 (Move LEFT). Specifically, we want to know: 1. Which objects move? 2. How far do they move? 3. Are there any boundaries on the left side of the screen? 4. Does it affect any UI elements?",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing horizontal movement. The playable blocks are in the central-right area, giving ample space to observe movement to the left without immediately hitting a boundary. No previous action had 'no effect', so no setup sequence is strictly required to move to a new position before testing a pending action."
