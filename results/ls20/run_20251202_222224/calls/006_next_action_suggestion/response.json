  "target_action": "ACTION3",

  "reasoning": "ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5 have not been observed yet, making them the highest priority for testing. Since the two previous actions were vertical movements, it's strategic to explore horizontal movement next to understand the full movement capabilities of the playable blocks. There are no current state limitations preventing the testing of ACTION3, unlike being near a boundary with vertical movement. The current position allows testing horizontal movement without immediate collisions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION3 (Move LEFT). Specifically, we want to know: 1. Which objects move? 2. How far do they move? 3. Are there any boundaries on the left side of the screen? 4. Does it affect any UI elements?",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing horizontal movement. The playable blocks are in the central-right area, giving ample space to observe movement to the left without immediately hitting a boundary. No previous action had 'no effect', so no setup sequence is strictly required to move to a new position before testing a pending action."
