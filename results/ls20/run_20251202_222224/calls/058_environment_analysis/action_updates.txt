ACTION3: ACTION3 attempts to move the player-controlled blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit to the left. If movement is possible, the blocks will move. A 'NO effect' message indicates no secondary effect (e.g., UI change, score update) occurred, not that primary movement failed.
  Reason: Repeated observation shows that ACTION3 successfully moves the blocks left even when the action log states 'NO effect'. This clarifies that 'NO effect' refers to secondary game state changes, not the core movement function.
