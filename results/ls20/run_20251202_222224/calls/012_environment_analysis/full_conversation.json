What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay."

        "text": "Analyze the environment in this game frame.\n\nWHAT JUST HAPPENED:\nACTION5 had NO effect: The action ACTION5 had no visible effect on the game state.\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBackground: Color 3 (green)\nBorder: Yes (Color 8 (red)) - A single row of Color 8 pixels at the top, spanning almost the entire width, with two Color 11 (orange) blocks next to it. This top border acts as a wall, preventing upward movement past a certain point. There's also a border of Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) at the bottom.\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - Upward movement is constrained by the Color 8 (red) border at the top of the play area.\n  - Downward movement is likely constrained by the Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) border at the bottom.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Playable Block 1: Color 12 (purple) Rectangular block (8x2) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)\n  - Playable Block 2: Color 9 (light blue) Rectangular block (8x6) (Role: Player-controlled or interactive object)\n  - Moving object with purple and black parts: Color 5 (purple) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of purple and black pixels (Role: Secondary player-controlled object or dynamic obstacle/collectible)\n  - Moving object with yellow and black parts: Color 6 (yellow) and Color 0 (black) Irregular shape composed of yellow and black pixels (Role: Secondary player-controlled object or dynamic obstacle/collectible)\n  - Top border indicator: Color 8 (red) Single row of pixels (Role: Boundary/stopping point for upward movement)\n  - Top UI elements/score indicators: Color 11 (orange) Two small square blocks (Role: Score or game state indicator)\n  - Bottom border/ground: Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) Interspersed lines of pixels (Role: Boundary or resting surface)\nSpatial structure: The game appears to have a primary play area with a solid background and distinct top and bottom borders. Objects move freely within this vertical channel with a grid-like movement evident (objects moving by whole units). The top border marks the limit of upward movement, and a bottom border likely limits downward movement. There are also distinct background variations (different shades of green) suggesting zones within the main play area.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Identified the top border as a solid boundary (Color 8) for upward movement. This is a critical discovery for understanding movement constraints.\n- Recognized the distinct Color 0 (black) and Color 7 (light green) pattern at the bottom as a probable boundary or 'ground'.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What defines the left and right boundaries of the play area? Are they implicitly the edges of the screen, or are there invisible walls or specific colors?\n- What are the precise roles of the irregular objects (yellow/black and purple/black)? Are they also controlled by the player in some way, or are they obstacles/targets?\n- Does gravity play a role in this environment, or do objects only move when directly acted upon?\n- What purpose do the different shades of green in the background serve? Are they merely aesthetic, or do they indicate different zones or properties?\n- What is the significance of the Color 11 (orange) blocks in the top right? Are they part of a scoring mechanism or a counter?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS:\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 moves at least two specific blocks (color 12 and color 9) one unit upward (decreases their row/y coordinate). It might also update a UI element. This is consistent with the semantic hint 'Move UP (decrease row/y)'.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 moves selected blocks downwards by one unit. It also causes a change in a single pixel on the top UI, likely an indicator of game state.\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 moves the player-controlled block(s) one unit to the left. It also causes a minor change in the top UI, likely a score or timer update.\"\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n\nIf a movement action had NO EFFECT, the most likely reason is a WALL or BOUNDARY.\nLook carefully at the edges and any patterns that might indicate walls.\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf you have new questions to investigate, list them.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE in the new understanding\n\nDo NOT suggest updates for:\n- Minor refinements or rewording\n- Adding detail that doesn't change the core meaning\n- Speculation without strong evidence\n\nIf you DO suggest an update, keep it SIMPLE and CONCEPTUAL, e.g.:\n- \"moves player up, blocked by Color 0 walls\"\n- \"moves right within bounded play area\"\n- \"interacts with adjacent objects\"\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
