  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The action was applied to the game state where the color 12 block at (48, 48) and the color 9 block at (50, 48) were present. These blocks were not at the topmost boundary of the play area (indicated by a red line) nor blocked by other objects directly above them, enabling them to move upwards. The bounding box of the changes and affected regions are consistent with a 1-unit upward movement.",

  "context_description": "The game state contains two dynamic blocks (color 12 and color 9) positioned in the lower part of the play area (at column 48). A small UI element is present in the top_ui region. The two primary blocks are a color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 48) and a color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 48).",
