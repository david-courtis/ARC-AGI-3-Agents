  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous two attempts while in roughly the same position. To validate the 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' hypothesis further, we need to try it in a different spatial context. Since no movement actions are verified, we will use ACTION4 twice, as it has one consistent observation. Moving the main blocks to the right will change their position relative to the other objects and background variations, potentially enabling a context-dependent effect for ACTION5. This also gives us more observations of ACTION4, pushing it closer to verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to either observe an effect from ACTION5, which would help us understand its context-dependent nature (e.g., does it rotate the purple/black L-shape or interact with the yellow/black block?), or further confirm its lack of effect in this new position, suggesting it requires a very specific setup, or is not yet applicable. We will also get two more observations for ACTION4, which could lead to its verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state, with the primary playable blocks in the mid-right, has proven to be unsuitable for revealing the effects of ACTION5. Moving to a new position, further to the right, will alter the relative positions of the playable blocks to the other irregular objects and background elements, which could be critical for ACTION5's functionality."
