  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 4 consecutive 'no effect' observations and must be re-tested from a different position. Since none of the movement actions are fully verified, we will use ACTION4, which has one consistent observation and 2 attempts, to move the primary blocks to a new position. Moving the central blocks to the right by using ACTION4 a few times will create a new context to test ACTION5. This strategy aims to discover if ACTION5 requires the primary blocks to be at a specific location or near a particular object to have an effect. By moving them further to the right, we change their spatial relationship with other objects and potentially activate ACTION5's intended function. Additionally, this allows us to gather more data points for ACTION4's verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe an effect from ACTION5, which will help us understand its functionality (e.g., interaction, selection, or rotation) and the conditions under which it operates. This test will also provide additional observations for ACTION4, moving it closer to verification. By moving the blocks to a new position, we hope to disambiguate the role of ACTION5 as either context-dependent or dysfunctional in certain states.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows the primary playable blocks (color 12 and color 9) in a central-right position. There are other moving objects composed of purple/black and yellow/black pixels, as well as UI elements. The four recent 'no effect' observations for ACTION5 suggest it is highly context-dependent or requires specific conditions to trigger an effect. The current position does not seem to provide the necessary context for ACTION5. Therefore, repositioning the primary blocks is crucial."
