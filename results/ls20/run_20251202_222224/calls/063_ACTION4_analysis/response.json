They were not at the rightmost boundary of the play area nor blocked by other objects directly to their right, enabling them to move right. The change bounding box rows [2-55], cols [18-55] confirms the visual shift of objects and is consistent with previous rightward movements. The UI change is a consistent secondary effect.",
