  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has been tested multiple times in recent history, often resulting in 'no effect' messages, and has now had 3 consecutive 'no-effects' with the player-controlled blocks at the left edge. While the blocks did move, the 'no-effect' refers to secondary effects. It's time to move on to another action for further validation. ACTION4 has 2/3 consistent observations and needs one more to be verified. There are no other actions that are close to verification that also need to be tested (ACTION1 and ACTION2 both have 1/3 consistent results). Given the player-controlled blocks are currently at the left-most edge (based on ACTION3's 'no effect' on UI despite movement), a move to the right would be a good test case for ACTION4.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm ACTION4's effect of moving the player-controlled blocks (color 12 and 9) one unit to the right and observe if it consistently changes a single pixel in the top UI. This would lead to ACTION4 becoming a 'verified' action and can then be confidently used in setup sequences.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows the primary playable blocks (color 12 and 9) at the far left edge of the play area. This is a good position to test rightward movement (ACTION4), as it's unlikely to encounter immediate obstacles or boundaries to the right, allowing us to observe its full effect. There are other objects (yellow/black, purple/black) in the center, and a cyan/purple block towards the bottom right, but they are not directly interacting with the main playable blocks in a way that would impede rightward movement."
