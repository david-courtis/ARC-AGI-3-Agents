  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has only 0/3 consistent observations and 2/8 attempts, making it a high priority for validation. Although it had a NO EFFECT recently, this was due to the left boundary. In the current state, the primary playable blocks (color 12 and 9) are in the center-right of the screen (color 12 at (40, 32), color 9 at (48, 38) as confirmed by the last ACTION3 effect) and thus have ample space to move left without hitting the boundary. This allows for a clean test of ACTION3's leftward movement. Re-testing ACTION5 is not advisable as it has been exhausted with 'no effect' attempts. ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION4 have more consistent observations and are less critical to test right now than ACTION3.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe ACTION3 moving the primary playable blocks (color 12 and 9) one unit to the left. This will provide more evidence for its definition and help us understand if there are any other conditions or side effects not yet observed. Successfully moving left will increase its consistency count.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The primary playable blocks (Color 12 and 9) are currently positioned in the center-right area, with sufficient space to their left for movement. There are no immediate obstacles blocking leftward movement. The board appears to be in a good state to test horizontal movement actions like ACTION3."
