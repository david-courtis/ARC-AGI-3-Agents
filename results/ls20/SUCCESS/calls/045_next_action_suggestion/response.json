  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 is the only pending action that needs further validation, currently at 2/3 consistent observations. There are movable blocks in the current state that can be used to test ACTION4's movement to the right. ACTION5 has had 4 consecutive no-effects, so it should not be tested until we can move the game pieces to a new configuration. We will attempt to get the third observation for ACTION4 to verify it.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify ACTION4's definition as 'moves selected objects one step to the RIGHT' by getting the third consistent observation. This will move ACTION4 from a 'pending' to a 'verified' status.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board contains several movable block objects (Yellow Block, Purple Block Fragment, Cyan Block Fragment, New Purple Rectangular Block, New Cyan Rectangular Block) and open space to the right of them in the play area, making it suitable for testing ACTION4 without a setup sequence for movement. There are still move indicator dots available, meaning actions are possible."
