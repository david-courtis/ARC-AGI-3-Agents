  "reasoning": "ACTION3 is currently only 2/3 consistent. We need one more consistent observation to verify it. The current state is suitable for testing ACTION3 as there are movable blocks (Yellow Block and the new rectangular blocks) that appear to have space to move left. ACTION5 just had a 'no effect', but its last no-effect was due to depleted moves. The current state has available moves, so we don't need a setup sequence to avoid a no-op from ACTION5. However, since the goal is to verify ACTION3 and ACTION4, we should prioritize them when contexts are good. Since there is space to the left, this is a good opportunity to test ACTION3.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify if ACTION3 consistently moves movable blocks to the left by one column. This will consolidate our understanding of ACTION3's core functionality.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game state has available moves. There are several movable objects, including the 'Yellow Block', 'New Purple Rectangular Block', and 'New Cyan Rectangular Block', which appear to have space to move left. There are no immediate obstacles to prevent leftward movement for all movable blocks. The top UI shows a number of 'Move Indicator Dots' (Color 9), indicating that actions are currently possible."
