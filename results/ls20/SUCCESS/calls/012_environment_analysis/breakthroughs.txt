1. Discovered 'Depleted Move Indicator Dots' (Color 5, red), confirming the move counter mechanism tracks consumed moves by changing their color.
2. Identified a new object type: 'Yellow Block' (Color 11), a composite object containing Color 0 and Color 9 pixels, suggesting objects can combine or carry others.
3. The previous 'Purple Block' and 'Cyan Block' have drastically reduced in size (to 1x2 and 1x2 pixels respectively), indicating they are either broken down, transformed, or represent a different state of the original blocks. This suggests blocks are not static in their initial forms and can be manipulated or consumed.
4. The L-shaped blocks (Color 0) appear to be breaking down or fragmenting into smaller black pixels, suggesting they might be destroyable or can change shape over time/interaction.
