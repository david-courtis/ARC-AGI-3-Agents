  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "All move indicator dots are red (Color 5), meaning no moves are possible. All recent attempts with ACTION5 have resulted in no effect due to this condition. Therefore, we cannot test any action in the current state until the game state changes, presumably by a new game starting or moves being replenished. However, since the goal is to make a strategic choice, and ACTION1-4 are still unverified, we will choose ACTION1 as a placeholder hoping for a state change that allows action. We also need to get more observations for ACTION1 as it has only 1/3 consistent observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe a new game state where moves are available. If moves become available, we can then test ACTION1 to confirm its movement definition. If it remains a no-op, it further confirms that game progress is entirely blocked in this state.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board assessment is that the game is in a 'game over' or 'waiting for reset' state, as all move indicators are depleted. No actions are currently possible according to the previous observations. The objects are static in their current positions, and no UI elements suggest immediate interaction possibility."
