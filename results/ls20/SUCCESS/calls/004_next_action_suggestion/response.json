  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not been observed at all. Our highest priority is to test unobserved actions to begin building fundamental knowledge about the game's mechanics. The current state is as good as any to test a new movement action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Observing the effect of ACTION2 (Move DOWN). This will either move the blocks downwards, clarify if some entity moves downwards, or show no effect at all. This is crucial for understanding basic navigation in the game.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board shows objects (purple and cyan blocks) that moved upwards in the previous action. This suggests that movement actions might affect these object. Testing another movement action like ACTION2 (Move DOWN) directly now would provide a good contrast or confirmation of the movement interaction."
