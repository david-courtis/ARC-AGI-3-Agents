  "interpretation": "ACTION4 caused two rectangular blocks to move right by one column. The cyan block (Color 12) moved from (40,40) to (40,41), and the purple block (Color 9) moved from (42,40) to (42,41). A move was consumed, indicated by the top UI bar where a purple dot (Color 9) turned red (Color 5).",

This allowed them to shift right by one column. The top UI element reduced by one dot, which is consistent with a move being consumed.",
