ACTION1: ACTION1 moves some rectangular blocks upwards by one row, and consumes one move counter dot (Color 9) from the top UI.
  Reason: The 'WHAT JUST HAPPENED' explicitly states two blocks moved up, and the environment analysis revealed that a purple dot (Color 9) from the top UI disappeared, indicating a successful move for game state tracking.
