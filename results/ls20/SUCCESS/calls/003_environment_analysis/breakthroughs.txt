1. Identified a 'Move Indicator Dots' UI element (Color 9 dots at the top) which decreased by one, indicating a move counter. This is critical for understanding game progression and failure conditions.
2. Identified 'Goal Indicators' (Color 12 squares at the top right UI) and a 'Bottom UI line' (Color 7 squares) that are separate from the main play area and likely track progress or different states.
3. Confirmed that 'Color 8 (light green)' defines the main playable area where objects move, contrasting with the 'Color 3 (green)' background.
4. The game has distinct UI elements for score/progress/moves at the top and bottom, separate from the primary play area.
