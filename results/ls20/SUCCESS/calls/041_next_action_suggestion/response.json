  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 is currently 2/3 consistent and needs one more consistent observation to be verified. All recent actions have caused movement, indicating the current state is suitable for testing movement actions. Since no movement actions have resulted in a 'no effect' in recent history, there's no need for a setup sequence. Testing ACTION2 directly will help verify its behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verification of ACTION2 (Move DOWN). We expect the rectangular blocks to move downwards by one row, and a move counter dot to be consumed. This will help confirm the consistent behavior of ACTION2 and potentially give us an understanding of how flexible the movement is.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board currently contains movable rectangular blocks (Color 9 and Color 12). There are no immediate obstructions visible below these blocks that would prevent downward movement, making it a good state to test ACTION2. The move counter also has available moves. The 'Yellow Block' (Color 11) is also present, but its interaction with movement is still uncertain at this point, so confirming basic movement of the rectangular blocks is the priority."
