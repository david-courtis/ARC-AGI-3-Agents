  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been observed yet, making it the highest priority to test. Given that ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 have shown effects on rectangular blocks, it's crucial to understand if ACTION4 also moves these blocks, and in what direction. The current state has movable blocks present, which is suitable for testing general movement actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Determine if ACTION4 causes movement, specifically of the rectangular blocks (Color 9 and Color 12), and in which direction (likely 'RIGHT'). We also expect to observe if a 'Move Indicator Dot' (Color 9) is consumed, confirming it's a valid move.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is good for testing movement actions. Several rectangular blocks (Color 9 and Color 12) are present that have previously responded to other movement actions. There is clear space to the right of these blocks in the main play area (Color 8), suggesting movement to the right would not be immediately obstructed. The UI elements (Move Indicator Dots, Goal Indicators, Bottom UI line) are visible and can be observed for changes."
