The internal layout suggests open spaces potentially containing obstacles or interactable items. UI elements are clearly separated from the play area.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a 'Move Indicator Dots' UI element (Color 9 dots at the top) which decreased by one, indicating a move counter. This is critical for understanding game progression and failure conditions.\n  - Identified 'Goal Indicators' (Color 12 squares at the top right UI) and a 'Bottom UI line' (Color 7 squares) that are separate from the main play area and likely track progress or different states.\n  - Confirmed that 'Color 8 (light green)' defines the main playable area where objects move, contrasting with the 'Color 3 (green)' background.\n  - The game has distinct UI elements for score/progress/moves at the top and bottom, separate from the primary play area.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Objects can move upwards.\n  - The dark green area (Color 8) acts as the primary movable space.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - Move Indicator Dots: Color 9 (purple) Small, single-pixel dots in a horizontal line (Role: Move/Turn counter)\n  - Goal Indicators: Color 12 (orange) Small squares (Role: Progress or goal indicators)\n  - Bottom UI line: Color 7 (light grey) Horizontal line of small squares (Role: Another type of progress or state indicator)\n  - Light green play area: Color 8 (light green) Large rectangular area (Role: Main playable area)\n  - Purple Block: Color 9 (purple) Rectangular block (8x6 in original state) (Role: Movable game piece / obstacle)\n  - Cyan Block: Color 12 (orange) Rectangular block (8x2 in original state) (Role: Movable game piece / obstacle)\n  - L-shaped Block: Color 0 (black) L-shaped block (Role: Fixed obstacle / boundary)\n  - Small Purple Square: Color 9 (purple) 1x1 square (Role: Small collectible or interactive element)\n  - Small Cyan Rectangle: Color 10 (cyan) Small rectangle (Role: Small collectible or interactive element)\n  - Small Yellow Square: Color 11 (yellow) Small square (Role: Small collectible or interactive element)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Are the L-shaped black blocks fixed obstacles, or can they also be moved?\n  - What is the significance of the small purple, cyan, and yellow squares/rectangles? Are they collectibles or parts of larger objects?\n  - What causes objects to move? Is it player control, or an automated process? (i.e. if it is player control, what are the player boundaries or avatars?)\n  - What are the victory conditions and failure conditions for the game?\n  - What is the purpose of the 'Goal Indicators' (Color 12 squares) and the 'Bottom UI line' (Color 7 squares)?\n  - Are there any other boundaries besides the edge of the light green play area that would block movement?\n  - Do any colors represent 'null' or empty cells in the context of movable objects?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state!

Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration.

The current state has movable blocks present, which is suitable for testing general movement actions.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Determine if ACTION4 causes movement, specifically of the rectangular blocks (Color 9 and Color 12), and in which direction (likely 'RIGHT'). We also expect to observe if a 'Move Indicator Dot' (Color 9) is consumed, confirming it's a valid move.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is good for testing movement actions. Several rectangular blocks (Color 9 and Color 12) are present that have previously responded to other movement actions. There is clear space to the right of these blocks in the main play area (Color 8), suggesting movement to the right would not be immediately obstructed. The UI elements (Move Indicator Dots, Goal Indicators, Bottom UI line) are visible and can be observed for changes."
