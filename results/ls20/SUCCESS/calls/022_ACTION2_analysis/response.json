  "interpretation": "ACTION2 caused two rectangular blocks to move downwards by one row. The cyan block (Color 12) moved from (40,48) to (41,48) and the purple block (Color 9) moved from (42,48) to (43,48). As with previous successful actions, a move was consumed, indicated by a change in the top UI bar (one purple dot turned red, and one red dot turned purple).",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION2 moves the selected/active block(s) downwards by one row, provided there is nothing blocking the movement (e.g., another block, a boundary, or the edge of the play area). Movement consumes one turn, indicated by a change in the top UI dots.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": true,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The cyan block (Color 12) at (40, 48) and the purple block (Color 9) at (42, 48) had clear space below them within the play area, allowing them to shift down by one row. The top UI element also changed color reflecting the consumption of a move.",

  "context_description": "We are observing a game board with a cyan (Color 12) rectangular block at (40, 48) and a purple (Color 9) rectangular block at (42, 48) in the lower right of the play area. There are no obvious obstacles below these blocks. The top UI displays a row of dots, some purple (Color 9) and some red (Color 5).",
