  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous two attempts. According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move first. Since no actions are yet verified, we will use the most recently observed successful action (ACTION4, which appears to move objects right) to change the state. Moving right twice should ensure a significant change in the positions of movable objects. The goal is to move the 'Yellow Block' (Color 11) closer to the 'Small Cyan Rectangle' (Color 10) and 'Purple Block' (Color 9) in the bottom right, to see if ACTION5 has an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' effect when objects are adjacent or overlapping. This strategic movement helps us explore the context-dependent nature of ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION5 has a different effect when objects are in closer proximity, potentially revealing 'INTERACT', 'SELECT', or 'ROTATE' functionality. We can also confirm if ACTION4 consistently moves objects to the right.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board features several movable objects (Yellow Block, Purple Block, Cyan Block, Small Purple Pixel). ACTION5 previously had no effect, indicating a need to change the spatial relationship between objects or the 'player' position. By using ACTION4 (move right) twice, we aim to strategically reposition the blocks to test ACTION5's interaction capabilities."
