In this instance, as in the previous two, no pixels changed in the play area or UI elements. This indicates that either the action is used for an internal game state change not visible at the pixel level, or it requires a very specific context (e.g., selection of an object, interaction with a particular type of object or location) that has not yet been met, or the 'current position' referred to in the hint is not where any actionable item is located.",
