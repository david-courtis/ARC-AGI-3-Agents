  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 3 consecutive 'no effect' attempts. The critical rule states that if an action had no effect, we MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first. Since all other movement actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) have recently caused visual effects, they are suitable for a setup sequence. I'm choosing ACTION1 to move the objects upwards, as this will change their position and potentially the context for ACTION5. After moving, we will re-test ACTION5 to see if the change in position enables it to have an effect. By moving the yellow block and its carried pixels, we test if 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' is context-dependent on object proximity or position within the play area.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Testing ACTION5 after a movement will help us understand if its past 'no effect' was due to the object's position or the general game state (like no moves left, although the current image still shows available moves). If it now has an effect, we can start to narrow down its function (e.g., selecting, rotating, or interacting with something specific at a certain position). If it still has no effect, it further strengthens the hypothesis that ACTION5 might be contextually specific (e.g., requires a specific object type, or specific spatial conditions like being near a 'Goal Indicator'), or might require more moves than currently visible to perform an action.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game state shows a 'Yellow Block' with a 'Small Black Pixel' and a 'Small Purple Pixel' on it. Other fragmented black and purple pixels are present. The 'Move Indicator Dots' are mostly depleted (red), but some purple dots remain, indicating moves are still available. ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 have consistently shown effects, moving the rectangular blocks. ACTION5 has been ineffective in its last three attempts. The current position of the 'Yellow Block' is central but not directly adjacent to any obvious interaction points like the L-shaped block or the 'Goal Indicators'. Moving it will create a new state to test for ACTION5's functionality."
