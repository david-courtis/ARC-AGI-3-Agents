Describe what happened when the action was taken\n2. Build/update a definition of what this action does\n3. Note any objects or environment features involved\n4. Track whether the action had any visible effect\n\nIMPORTANT - UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS:\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that count SUCCESSFUL moves\n- When an action HAS EFFECT (moves something), the move counter typically decreases\n- Changes in UI elements (e.g., red dots disappearing) indicate move consumption, NOT action effects\n- Focus on what happened in the PLAY AREA, not just UI changes\n- Running out of moves (counter reaches zero) causes game failure and reset\n\nBe precise and evidence-based. If you're uncertain, say so."
