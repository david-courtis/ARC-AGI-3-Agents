  "reasoning": "All actions are currently unknown and unobserved. We should start by testing basic movement actions. ACTION1 (Move UP) is an arbitrary but reasonable starting point for movement exploration. There's no immediate context making it a bad choice.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Whether ACTION1 moves the player character up, or if it has another effect, or no effect at all. This will be the first observation for movement.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game board appears to have a green background with several colored blocks resembling a maze or obstacles, a yellow block with black and purple elements (likely the player character), a small purple and black block, a light blue and purple block, and some red and orange elements along the top border. No actions have been taken, so the state is fresh for initial exploration."
