  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has only 1/3 consistent observations and only 1 attempt out of 8, making it the least validated movement action. While ACTION5 also needs validation, it had 3 consecutive no-effects in recent trials, suggesting it requires a different state to be effective. The current state is good for testing movement actions as there appear to be clear paths for the main objects (Yellow Block, Purple/Cyan Fragments) to move right. Continuing to validate basic movement actions is a priority.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validate the 'move right' functionality of ACTION4 and observe how it affects the various objects (Yellow Block, Cyan Fragment, Purple Block Fragment). We also want to observe if it interacts with the L-shaped block or boundary, and how it impacts the move counter.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board has active movable elements (Yellow Block, Cyan Fragment, Purple Fragment) and clear paths for lateral movement. The 'Depleted Move Indicator Dots' (Color 5) indicate moves have been consumed, but there are still 'Move Indicator Dots' (Color 9) available, implying actions can still be taken. The L-shaped block at the bottom left is an obstacle, but not directly in the path for a rightward movement test for the main cluster of objects. The top-left L-shaped block is far from where we expect the main objects to move."
