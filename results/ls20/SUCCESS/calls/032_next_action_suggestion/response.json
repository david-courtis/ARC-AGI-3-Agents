  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has been consistently ineffective due to depleted move indicators. It is now verified. Among the pending actions, ACTION2 has the fewest consistent observations (1/3) and needs more validation. The current state has movable blocks (the Yellow Block) and space below it, which seems suitable for testing downward movement without immediate obstruction. This is a good opportunity to gather more observations for ACTION2.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validate the definition of ACTION2, specifically how it affects the Yellow Block and the Small Purple Pixel on top of it, and confirm move counter consumption.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state has movable objects (Yellow Block with a Small Purple Pixel on top, and a Cyan Block with an underlying Purple Block) within the main play area. There is clear space below the Yellow Block. The move indicators are almost entirely depleted (Color 5), but there is one Color 9 dot remaining, meaning we can execute one more action. This is a good state to test movement actions for efficiency before potentially running out of moves completely."
