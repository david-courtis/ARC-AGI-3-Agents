  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been observed, making it the highest priority for initial testing. Since we don't know what it does, we test it in the current state to get a baseline observation. There are various objects present that it might interact with.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discovering the fundamental behavior of ACTION5. Does it interact with nearby objects, rotate them, select them, or something else entirely? We will observe any changes to the game state, UI, or objects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board has multiple distinct objects (L-shaped blocks, small purple squares, small cyan rectangles, small yellow squares, and the existing purple and cyan blocks from previous actions). This diverse set of objects provides a good initial test environment for an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action like ACTION5, as it increases the chances of observing some effect."
