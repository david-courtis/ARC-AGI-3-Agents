  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 and ACTION4 have never been observed, making them high priority. Given that ACTION1 (move up) and ACTION2 (move down) have both caused movement, it's logical to test the other directional moves, ACTION3 and ACTION4, next. Since both have equal priority, choosing ACTION3 first is arbitrary. We don't need a setup sequence as we are directly testing a heretofore unobserved action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION3 (Move LEFT) on the game elements. Specifically, whether blocks move left, if there are any boundaries, or what other effects this action might have. This will contribute to our understanding of movement mechanics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows several blocks (Purple Block, Cyan Block, L-shaped Block) and smaller elements. The central L-shaped block is near other objects, which might be a good context for observing movement interactions. The current position is suitable for testing a new directional movement action."
