CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves some rectangular blocks upwards by one row, and consumes one move counter dot (Color 9) from the top UI.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts
  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 3 (green)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))
  Description: The main play area appears to be a large green square, bordered by a darker green around the inner play area, but the outermost border encompassing the grid is Color 3.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  The game appears to be played on a grid, likely within a larger square area defined by 'Color 8 (light green)'. The internal layout suggests open spaces potentially containing obstacles or interactable items. UI elements are clearly separated from the play area.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a 'Move Indicator Dots' UI element (Color 9 dots at the top) which decreased by one, indicating a move counter. This is critical for understanding game progression and failure conditions.
  - Identified 'Goal Indicators' (Color 12 squares at the top right UI) and a 'Bottom UI line' (Color 7 squares) that are separate from the main play area and likely track progress or different states.
  - Confirmed that 'Color 8 (light green)' defines the main playable area where objects move, contrasting with the 'Color 3 (green)' background.
  - The game has distinct UI elements for score/progress/moves at the top and bottom, separate from the primary play area.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Objects can move upwards.
  - The dark green area (Color 8) acts as the primary movable space.

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - Move Indicator Dots: Color 9 (purple) Small, single-pixel dots in a horizontal line (Role: Move/Turn counter)
  - Goal Indicators: Color 12 (orange) Small squares (Role: Progress or goal indicators)
  - Bottom UI line: Color 7 (light grey) Horizontal line of small squares (Role: Another type of progress or state indicator)
  - Light green play area: Color 8 (light green) Large rectangular area (Role: Main playable area)
  - Purple Block: Color 9 (purple) Rectangular block (8x6 in original state) (Role: Movable game piece / obstacle)
  - Cyan Block: Color 12 (orange) Rectangular block (8x2 in original state) (Role: Movable game piece / obstacle)
  - L-shaped Block: Color 0 (black) L-shaped block (Role: Fixed obstacle / boundary)
  - Small Purple Square: Color 9 (purple) 1x1 square (Role: Small collectible or interactive element)
  - Small Cyan Rectangle: Color 10 (cyan) Small rectangle (Role: Small collectible or interactive element)
  - Small Yellow Square: Color 11 (yellow) Small square (Role: Small collectible or interactive element)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Are the L-shaped black blocks fixed obstacles, or can they also be moved?
  - What is the significance of the small purple, cyan, and yellow squares/rectangles? Are they collectibles or parts of larger objects?
  - What causes objects to move? Is it player control, or an automated process? (i.e. if it is player control, what are the player boundaries or avatars?)
  - What are the victory conditions and failure conditions for the game?
  - What is the purpose of the 'Goal Indicators' (Color 12 squares) and the 'Bottom UI line' (Color 7 squares)?
  - Are there any other boundaries besides the edge of the light green play area that would block movement?
  - Do any colors represent 'null' or empty cells in the context of movable objects?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6) at (50, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (8x2): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 9 rectangular block (8x6): Involved in ACTION2 action
