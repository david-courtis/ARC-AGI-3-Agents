ACTION5: ACTION5 is ineffective when no moves remain or when movement is otherwise obstructed.
  Reason: ACTION5 continued to have no effect even though the move counter is fully depleted (all dots are red). This suggests either the depletion of moves prevents any action, or the action is still being blocked by an unmoving obstacle/boundary, or another game state prevents its execution. The highest confidence interpretation is that no moves remaining is the primary reason for its inefficacy in this specific frame.
