  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in the previous state. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying a no-effect action. Since no movement actions are fully verified, we will use ACTION4, which has a observed effect of moving objects to the right, to change the object's position. This will allow us to test ACTION5 in a new context. Moving three steps right should significantly change the object's position relative to its surroundings. This strategic movement will either reveal new context where ACTION5 works, or further confirm that ACTION5 is a context-dependent action that requires specific adjacent objects.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to either see an effect from ACTION5 in the new position, or learn that more specific conditions are required for ACTION5 to work. If it still has no effect, we will have further validated that its functionality is highly context-dependent and that simple spatial repositioning isn't enough to trigger it. This also helps to further validate ACTION4 by observing its movement for multiple steps.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state has various objects, some of which are very small. ACTION5 previously had no effect. The yellow block is in the center-top right. The small purple and cyan blocks are lower in the play area. It's unclear what object ACTION5 might interact with, or what its purpose is. Therefore, a change of position is critical to explore its behavior."
