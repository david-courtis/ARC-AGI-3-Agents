  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 3 consecutive no-effects and indicates that 'no moves remain or when movement is otherwise obstructed'. Given that all 'Move Indicator Dots' (Color 9) have been depleted and turned into 'Depleted Move Indicator Dots' (Color 5, red), it is highly probable that the 'no effect' of ACTION5 is due to the lack of available moves. Testing ACTION5 again in this state without a setup sequence would likely result in another no-effect. The other actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) have only one observation each and need 3 consistent observations to be verified. Since all move-related actions reduce the move counter, and it's already depleted, it is a low priority to test another move action. However, to make progress, we must try to execute a move action to see if it implicitly replenishes moves, or if moves only apply to ACTION5 (which is less likely given the previous descriptions for ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4). Since ACTION1 was the first among the movement actions, it's a logical next step to try.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We want to see if executing a movement action (ACTION1) is still possible despite depleted move dots. This will clarify if the 'move dots' apply to all actions or just ACTION5, and if no moves truly means no movement is allowed. If it moves, we gain another observation for ACTION1. If it generates a no-effect, we can solidify our understanding that 'no moves remaining' prevents ALL actions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows all 'Move Indicator Dots' have been depleted (Color 5, red), strongly suggesting zero remaining moves. The 'Yellow Block' (Color 11) is carrying a 'Small Purple Pixel' (Color 9). There is also a 'Cyan Block Fragment' (Color 10) and an L-shaped block (Color 0). The last three attempts of ACTION5 resulted in no effect, which is likely due to the lack of moves. The game board also features various obstacles and the 'Light green play area' (Color 8)."
