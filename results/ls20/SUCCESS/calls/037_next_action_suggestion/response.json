  "reasoning": "ACTION4 only has 1/3 consistent observations. While it had a positive effect in the most recent observation where it *was* tested (6th action ago), it needs more validation. There are still two visible move indicator dots (green dots at the top left), showing we have remaining moves. The previous no-effect actions for ACTION5 are irrelevant because we are not testing ACTION5 and the reason for ACTION5's no-effect is that all moves were depleted. In the current state, there are movable blocks (Yellow Block, Cyan and Purple blocks in the bottom right, and the fragmented Purple and Cyan Blocks near the L-shape) that could potentially move right. We want to complete the verification of ACTION4 and observe its effects in this different configuration of objects.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Confirm ACTION4's definition of moving objects to the right, and observe which objects it affects in this specific configuration. This helps us get to 2/3 consistent observations for ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board has several movable objects and there are still moves available. This is a good state to test movement actions. The objects are spread out, minimizing blockages for horizontal movement."
