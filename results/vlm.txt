2025-12-03 04:12:25,169 | INFO | Assistant: The current frame displays a large, complex map layout (64x64) filled with walls (values 3 and 4), potential hazards (values 9 and 15), and water (value 12). There is a distinct open area of empty space (value 0) in the bottom-left quadrant (around rows 53-62), which is likely the starting zone. I will attempt to navigate out of this corner, likely by moving RIGHT or DOWN, to identify the avatar's position and explore the map.

2025-12-03 04:13:49,115 | INFO | Assistant: The current frame remains identical to the initial frame after an attempted move to the Right. This lack of visual feedback suggests that either the avatar's movement was blocked (e.g., typically starting against a wall with the opening in another direction), the avatar is located in a different section of the map than assumed, or the game requires an interaction to begin. The map features a prominent "empty" room of 0s in the bottom-left corner and various hazards and paths elsewhere. Assuming the avatar might be in the top-left of the starting zone but blocked to the right, I will try moving Down to provoke a state change or identify the position.

2025-12-03 04:14:14,965 | INFO | Assistant: The previous action of moving Down also resulted in no change to the frame, meaning movement in that direction was blocked. Having tried Right and Down with no success, and with the previous reasoning that the avatar likely started in the top-left of the small open area `0` at (53, 4), the logical remaining option to explore this immediate starting space is to move Left or Up. However, looking at the map structure in the bottom-left area, the `0` values form a corridor. If I started at the top of it (row 53, col 4) and Right/Down were blocked, it's possible I'm actually at the *bottom* or *right* edge of a small enclosure, or my initial position assumption is slightly off. Given the map layout showing `0`s at cols 4-6, rows 53-62, and walls around, if Right and Down are blocked, I might be in the bottom-right corner of that little zone. Let's try moving **Left** (ACTION3) to navigate the open space.

2025-12-03 04:15:14,937 | INFO | Assistant: The previous action (Left) was successful, as indicated by a slight change in the frame state (specifically in Row 2, though this might be a global state change or remote entity). More importantly, the hypothesis that the avatar started in the bottom-right cul-de-sac of the starting zone (around row 62, column 9) remains consistent with the previous "blocked" results for Right and Down. Access to the main vertical corridor (columns 4-6) requires moving further Left past the walls at row 61, columns 7-9. Therefore, I will continue moving Left.

2025-12-03 04:15:46,325 | INFO | Assistant: The previous action (Left) caused another state change, indicating continued successful movement. Since I started in the bottom-right pocket (around row 62, cols 7-9) and am moving towards the main corridor (cols 4-6), I need to continue moving Left to fully exit the alcove and reach the vertical passage.

2025-12-03 04:17:06,509 | INFO | Assistant: The previous action (Left) appears to have been valid. I have now moved Left three times from the hypothesized starting position in the bottom-right corner (column 9). This places me at approximately column 6, which corresponds to the rightmost lane of the vertical corridor (columns 4-6). To ensure I am centrally positioned in the corridor before moving North, I will take one more step to the Left to reach column 5.

2025-12-03 04:17:38,930 | INFO | Assistant: The sequence of four 'Left' moves has successfully navigated the avatar out of the starting corner and alignment with the vertical corridor (columns 4-6) should now be established. Assuming I am centered at approximately column 5, the path North is clear. I will now switch direction and start moving Up to traverse the corridor.
