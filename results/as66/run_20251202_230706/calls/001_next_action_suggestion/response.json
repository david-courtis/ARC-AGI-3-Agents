  "reasoning": "All actions are unknown, prioritize testing a movement action. ACTION1 (Move UP) is chosen as the first to test. The current position appears to be in the middle of an open space, which is a good neutral starting point for movement testing. There are no walls directly above to impede movement, unlike the bottom where a black mouth-like feature might be in the way of other actions. This should give a clear observation of its effect.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION1 (Move UP). This will tell us if it moves the agent and in what direction. This will be the first step in building our understanding of movement actions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The agent (black mouth-like feature) is in the bottom-middle of a red area with green splotches. There's an orange pixel in the upper right green splotch. There are blue and light blue borders on the left and right, and a pink border at the top, a blue border at the bottom. The current position seems open for movement in several directions."
