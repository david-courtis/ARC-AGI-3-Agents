1. A yellow (Color 13) horizontal line, 1 pixel high, is observed at the very bottom of the screen, extending full width. Its position as a distinct element outside the play area suggests it is a new UI element, potentially related to the 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14) or another game state indicator.
2. The pale pink 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14) has changed its state from a 12-pixel wide line to a 10-pixel wide line. This confirms it shrinks, indicating move consumption. Specifically, two pixels have been removed from its right side.
3. The total width of the play area (not including borders) is 16 pixels. This is deduced from the width of the red background between the internal dark blue side borders.
