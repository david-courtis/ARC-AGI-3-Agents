Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves the player object (Color 0) one pixel UP. This action also affects a dynamic 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14) which changes its position and orientation around the border of the play area. It also causes the movable block (Color 8) to move up.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player (Color 0) one pixel downwards. It also affects the 'Move Indicator Bar', changing its position/color and consuming part of it. The Color 8 'block' likely moved down as well, but this is not visually confirmable from the provided images.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the player character (Color 0) one unit to the left. This action also consumes a 'move', which is indicated by a change in the 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14). The bar appears to rotate and change color/position upon move consumption.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Color 8 (light blue), Color 3 (light green), Color 10 (dark blue))
  Description: A solid light blue outer border that is two pixels thick. Inside this is another border of varying colors: light green (Color 3) on the top and bottom, and dark blue (Color 10) on the left and right. This creates a double border effect. There is also a pale pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the very top of the play area, just below the inner light green border, which is considered a UI element.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  A grid-based enclosed area with irregular 'terrain' features. The central play area is a large red rectangle, bordered by a double-layered wall system. The objects (player, obstacles, collectible) all reside within this red area.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a clear, multi-layered boundary system consisting of light blue, dark blue, and light green elements.
  - Identified a pale pink horizontal line at the top which is highly likely to be a UI element, specifically a move counter or progress indicator, due to its non-game-world appearance and typical placement of such elements.
  - The 'empty' space or background for interaction is Color 6 (red).
  - The exact width of the pale pink 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14) has been determined to be 12 pixels when fully visible. This confirms its size when 'full'.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Movement is likely constrained by the outer border (light blue, dark blue, light green).
  - Movement might be constrained by the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' objects, preventing passage through them.
  - The pale pink line at the top appears to be a UI element and not a movement constraint for the player within the main play area.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Color 3 (green) Obstacles/Terrain

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - Player or main character: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block with two visible 'feet' or protrusions downwards, 2x2 pixels (Role: Player or controllable entity)
  - Obstacles/Terrain: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped pixel clusters (Role: Obstacles or decorative terrain features)
  - Collectible/Target: Color 7 (orange) Single square pixel (Role: A collectible item, a goal, or a special interactable point.)
  - Move Indicator Bar: Color 14 (pale pink) Thin horizontal line (1 pixel high, 12 pixels wide) (Role: A UI element indicating remaining moves or progress)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - How does the pale pink move indicator bar change? Does it shrink, change color, or disappear in segments?
  - Can the player move freely over the red background (Color 6) areas?
  - Do the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' (Color 3) completely block movement, or do they only slow down/penalize the player?
  - What happens when the player interacts with the orange 'Collectible/Target' (Color 7)?
  - Does the black 'Player' (Color 0) have any specific interaction rules with the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' or the orange 'Collectible/Target'?
  - What are ACTION4 and ACTION5?
  - How many "moves" are indicated by the current state of the pale pink bar?

Legacy Objects:
  - Player or main character (Color 0, U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Move Indicator Bar (Color 14 / Color 13, pale pink / light pink horizontal line): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 8 block (if it actually moved, not visually confirmable): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Player or main character (Color 0): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Indicator Bar (Color 13 / Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Indicator Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Move Indicator Bar (Color 13/Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14) is a dynamic UI element that changes its position, orientation, and color (from Color 13 to Color 14) and potentially its size as moves are consumed. It seems to move from the top to the left border upon consumption.
  - The Color 8 rectangular block is a movable object that responds to certain player actions, in this case, moving left in conjunction with the player's left movement.
  - The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14) continues its dynamic behavior, moving from left to right on the border, maintaining its vertical orientation. The color remains Color 14.
  - The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14) cycles through positions around the border: top (horizontal), left (vertical), right (vertical), and then back to top (horizontal). This implies a consumption sequence or a visual representation of progress / remaining moves.
  - The Color 8 rectangular block is a movable object that moves in the same direction as the player when the player performs a corresponding directional action.
