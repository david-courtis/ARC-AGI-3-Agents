  ],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 and ACTION5 both had no effect recently. According to the rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before re-testing them. Since ACTION4 has had a clear effect of moving right, we can use it to move the player to a new position. After moving right, we will test ACTION1 again to see if it now produces an effect from a different spatial context. We prioritize actions with fewer observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving to a new position (via ACTION4) and then re-testing ACTION1, we aim to discover if ACTION1's 'no effect' was context-dependent or if it consistently has no effect in a wider range of states. We also hope to gain more consistent observations for ACTION1.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player is currently in a central position. There is an orange collectible to the top-right. We have two actions that recently had no effect (ACTION1, ACTION5) and need to be re-tested after strategic movement. ACTION4 has shown to move the player right, which is a good candidate for a setup move."
