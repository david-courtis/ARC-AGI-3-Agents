{
  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has no observations yet, making it a high priority for testing. Since there are no verified actions to create a complex setup sequence, and the player is not currently constrained against a right border, testing ACTION4 directly is efficient to gather initial observations. Unlike ACTION1, ACTION4 has not shown a 'no effect' result, so no setup is strictly required to move the player before testing it.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to learn if ACTION4 moves the player character (Color 0) to the right, and if it affects the 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14/13) or any other objects, similar to ACTION2 and ACTION3. This will provide foundational knowledge for a new directional movement.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player is in a central position, not constrained by the right border, making it a good state to test movement to the right. The player is not adjacent to any obstacles (Color 3) or the collectible (Color 7), so potential interactions with these can be ignored for this initial movement test. The 'Move Indicator Bar' is currently on the left side, which may impact how it reacts to a rightward movement."
