Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 seems to be an action that can sometimes cause no visible change. More observations are needed to understand its full effect.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player (Color 0) one pixel downwards. It also affects the 'Move Indicator Bar', changing its position/color and consuming part of it. The Color 8 'block' likely moved down as well, but this is not visually confirmable from the provided images.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the player character (Color 0) one unit to the left. This action also consumes a 'move', which is indicated by a change in the 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14). The bar appears to rotate and change color/position upon move consumption.

  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Color 8 (light blue))
  Description: A solid light blue outer border that is two pixels thick. Inside this is another border of varying colors: light green (Color 3) on the top and bottom, and dark blue (Color 10) on the left and right. This creates a double border effect. There is also a pale pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the very top of the play area, just below the inner light green border.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  A grid-based enclosed area with irregular 'terrain' features. The central play area is a large red rectangle, bordered by a double-layered wall system. The objects (player, obstacles, collectible) all reside within this red area.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a clear, multi-layered boundary system consisting of light blue, dark blue, and light green elements.
  - Identified a pale pink horizontal line at the top which is highly likely to be a UI element, specifically a move counter or progress indicator, due to its non-game-world appearance and typical placement of such elements.
  - The 'empty' space or background for interaction is Color 6 (red).

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Movement is likely constrained by the outer border (light blue, dark blue, light green).
  - Movement might be constrained by the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' objects, preventing passage through them.
  - The pale pink line at the top appears to be a UI element and not a movement constraint for the player within the main play area.

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - Player or main character: Color 0 (black) A U-shaped block with two visible 'feet' or protrusions downwards. Appears to be 2x2 pixels. (Role: Player or controllable entity)
  - Obstacles/Terrain: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped pixel clusters (Role: Obstacles or decorative terrain features)
  - Collectible/Target: Color 7 (orange) Single square pixel (Role: A collectible item, a goal, or a special interactable point.)
  - Move Indicator Bar: Color 14 (pale pink) Thin horizontal line (1 pixel high, 12 pixels wide) (Role: A UI element indicating remaining moves or progress)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What is the exact width of the pale pink move indicator bar when 'full'?
  - How does the pale pink move indicator bar change? Does it shrink, change color, or disappear in segments?
  - Can the player move freely over the red background (Color 6) areas?
  - Do the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' (Color 3) completely block movement, or do they only slow down/penalize the player?
  - What happens when the player interacts with the orange 'Collectible/Target' (Color 7)?
  - Does the black 'Player' (Color 0) have any specific interaction rules with the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' or the orange 'Collectible/Target'?
  - What are ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5?
  - How many "moves" are indicated by the current state of the pale pink bar?

Legacy Objects:
  - Player or main character (Color 0, U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Move Indicator Bar (Color 14 / Color 13, pale pink / light pink horizontal line): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 8 block (if it actually moved, not visually confirmable): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Player or main character (Color 0): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Move Indicator Bar (Color 13 / Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14) has dynamic behavior, changing position, color, and size upon an action. It appears to move from the top to the bottom of the play area as moves are consumed. The color changes from Color 14 (pale pink) to Color 13 (light pink).
  - The objects identified as Color 15 at (8,8) in previous analysis was actually Color 14, and the object at (4,8) was Color 14 and changed to Color 12. This needs to be corrected in the initial object identification or it was a typo in the previous analysis.
  - The Color 8 block was stated to have moved. This is not visibly confirmed in the images, but if true, suggests other objects might also move with player actions or are part of the game's mechanics.
  - The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14) is a dynamic UI element that changes its position, orientation, and color (from Color 13 to Color 14) and potentially its size as moves are consumed. It seems to move from the top to the left border upon consumption.
  - The Color 8 rectangular block is a movable object that responds to certain player actions, in this case, moving left in conjunction with the player's left movement.
