CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 seems to be an action that can sometimes cause no visible change. More observations are needed to understand its full effect.
  ACTION2: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Color 8 (light blue))
  Description: A solid light blue outer border that is two pixels thick. Inside this is another border of varying colors: light green (Color 3) on the top and bottom, and dark blue (Color 10) on the left and right. This creates a double border effect. There is also a pale pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the very top of the play area, just below the inner light green border.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  A grid-based enclosed area with irregular 'terrain' features. The central play area is a large red rectangle, bordered by a double-layered wall system. The objects (player, obstacles, collectible) all reside within this red area.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a clear, multi-layered boundary system consisting of light blue, dark blue, and light green elements.
  - Identified a pale pink horizontal line at the top which is highly likely to be a UI element, specifically a move counter or progress indicator, due to its non-game-world appearance and typical placement of such elements.
  - The 'empty' space or background for interaction is Color 6 (red).

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Movement is likely constrained by the outer border (light blue, dark blue, light green).
  - Movement might be constrained by the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' objects, preventing passage through them.
  - The pale pink line at the top appears to be a UI element and not a movement constraint for the player within the main play area.

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - Player or main character: Color 0 (black) A U-shaped block with two visible 'feet' or protrusions downwards. Appears to be 2x2 pixels. (Role: Player or controllable entity)
  - Obstacles/Terrain: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped pixel clusters (Role: Obstacles or decorative terrain features)
  - Collectible/Target: Color 7 (orange) Single square pixel (Role: A collectible item, a goal, or a special interactable point.)
  - Move Indicator Bar: Color 14 (pale pink) Thin horizontal line (1 pixel high, 12 pixels wide) (Role: A UI element indicating remaining moves or progress)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What is the exact width of the pale pink move indicator bar when 'full'?
  - How does the pale pink move indicator bar change? Does it shrink, change color, or disappear in segments?
  - Can the player move freely over the red background (Color 6) areas?
  - Do the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' (Color 3) completely block movement, or do they only slow down/penalize the player?
  - What happens when the player interacts with the orange 'Collectible/Target' (Color 7)?
  - Does the black 'Player' (Color 0) have any specific interaction rules with the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' or the orange 'Collectible/Target'?
  - What are ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5?
  - How many "moves" are indicated by the current state of the pale pink bar?

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
