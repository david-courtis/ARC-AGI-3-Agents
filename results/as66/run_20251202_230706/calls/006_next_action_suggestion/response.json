  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has never been observed, giving it the highest priority for testing. Both ACTION1 and ACTION2 have had at least one attempt, and ACTION1 resulted in no effect. To avoid re-testing ACTION1 in the same state, and to prioritize unobserved actions, ACTION3 is the best choice. No setup sequence is needed as we are testing a completely new action, and the current position is a valid starting point for testing movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to learn if ACTION3 causes player movement, in which direction, and any other effects it might have on the game state or UI elements (like the Move Indicator Bar). This will provide foundational knowledge for horizontal movement.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current game state shows the player (Color 0) in a central-lower position on the red background, surrounded by various green obstacles and borders. This is a neutral position suitable for testing new movement actions. The 'Move Indicator Bar' is present, which we know can be affected by actions."
