  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been observed, making it the highest priority for testing. The current state has a clear 'Collectible/Target' (Color 7, orange pixel) visible at (8,11), near the player's current implied position within the red background. This provides a good context to test 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE'. Since the player is not directly on top of the orange pixel, this test will reveal if 'INTERACT' has a range or if the player must be on top of the object. There's no strong reason to move first before trying ACTION5, as any movement might change the context of interaction. Also, since ACTION1 had no effect and is not verified, and ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4 are not yet verified, using pending actions in a setup sequence presents a risk of not understanding the setup itself.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION5 causes any change in the environment, especially around the orange 'Collectible/Target' or the player itself. This will reveal if ACTION5 is an interaction, selection, or rotation action, and if it has a range or requires direct contact. We will gain the first observation for ACTION5.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player (Color 0) is situated on the red background (Color 6), with a clear orange 'Collectible/Target' (Color 7) visible nearby at (8,11). There are also green 'Obstacles/Terrain' (Color 3) in various positions. The current state is suitable for testing an interaction type action, as there's a clear object to interact with nearby."
