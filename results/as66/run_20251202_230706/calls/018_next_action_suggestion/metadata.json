  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves the player object (Color 0) one pixel UP. This action also affects a dynamic 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14) which changes its position and orientation around the border of the play area. It also causes the movable block (Color 8) to move up.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player (Color 0) one pixel downwards. It also affects the 'Move Indicator Bar', changing its position/color and consuming part of it. The Color 8 'block' likely moved down as well, but this is not visually confirmable from the provided images.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the player character (Color 0) one unit to the left. This action also consumes a 'move', which is indicated by a change in the 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14). The bar appears to rotate and change color/position upon move consumption.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 8 (light blue), Color 3 (light green), Color 10 (dark blue))\n  Description: A solid light blue outer border that is two pixels thick. Inside this is another border of varying colors: light green (Color 3) on the top and bottom, and dark blue (Color 10) on the left and right. This creates a double border effect. There is also a pale pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the very top of the play area, just below the inner light green border, which is considered a UI element.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A grid-based enclosed area with irregular 'terrain' features. The central play area is a large red rectangle, bordered by a double-layered wall system. The objects (player, obstacles, collectible) all reside within this red area.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a clear, multi-layered boundary system consisting of light blue, dark blue, and light green elements.\n  - Identified a pale pink horizontal line at the top which is highly likely to be a UI element, specifically a move counter or progress indicator, due to its non-game-world appearance and typical placement of such elements.\n  - The 'empty' space or background for interaction is Color 6 (red).\n  - The exact width of the pale pink 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14) has been determined to be 12 pixels when fully visible. This confirms its size when 'full'.\n  - A yellow (Color 13) horizontal line, 1 pixel high, is observed at the very bottom of the screen, extending full width. Its position as a distinct element outside the play area suggests it is a new UI element, potentially related to the 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14) or another game state indicator.\n  - The pale pink 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14) has changed its state from a 12-pixel wide line to a 10-pixel wide line. This confirms it shrinks, indicating move consumption. Specifically, two pixels have been removed from its right side.\n  - The total width of the play area (not including borders) is 16 pixels. This is deduced from the width of the red background between the internal dark blue side borders.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Movement is likely constrained by the outer border (light blue, dark blue, light green).\n  - Movement might be constrained by the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' objects, preventing passage through them.\n  - The pale pink line at the top appears to be a UI element and not a movement constraint for the player within the main play area.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) Obstacles/Terrain\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - Player or main character: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block with two visible 'feet' or protrusions downwards, 2x2 pixels (Role: Player or controllable entity)\n  - Obstacles/Terrain: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped pixel clusters (Role: Obstacles or decorative terrain features)\n  - Collectible/Target: Color 7 (orange) Single square pixel (Role: A collectible item, a goal, or a special interactable point.)\n  - Move Indicator Bar: Color 14 (pale pink) Thin horizontal line (1 pixel high, 12 pixels wide) (Role: A UI element indicating remaining moves or progress)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - How does the yellow (Color 13) horizontal line at the bottom function? Is it also a move counter, a score indicator, or something else?\n  - Can the player move freely over the red background (Color 6) areas?\n  - Do the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' (Color 3) completely block movement, or do they only slow down/penalize the player?\n  - What happens when the player interacts with the orange 'Collectible/Target' (Color 7)?\n  - Does the black 'Player' (Color 0) have any specific interaction rules with the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' or the orange 'Collectible/Target'?\n  - What are ACTION4 and ACTION5?\n  - How many \"moves\" are indicated by the full state of the pale pink bar (12 pixels), and how many moves does each pixel represent? (One pixel represents one move, so 12 moves initially, now 10 after 2 actions?)\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Player or main character (Color 0, U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Move Indicator Bar (Color 14 / Color 13, pale pink / light pink horizontal line): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 block (if it actually moved, not visually confirmable): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Player or main character (Color 0): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Move Indicator Bar (Color 13 / Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Move Indicator Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Move Indicator Bar (Color 13/Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14) is a dynamic UI element that changes its position, orientation, and color (from Color 13 to Color 14) and potentially its size as moves are consumed. It seems to move from the top to the left border upon consumption.\n  - The Color 8 rectangular block is a movable object that responds to certain player actions, in this case, moving left in conjunction with the player's left movement.\n  - The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14) continues its dynamic behavior, moving from left to right on the border, maintaining its vertical orientation. The color remains Color 14.\n  - The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14) cycles through positions around the border: top (horizontal), left (vertical), right (vertical), and then back to top (horizontal). This implies a consumption sequence or a visual representation of progress / remaining moves.\n  - The Color 8 rectangular block is a movable object that moves in the same direction as the player when the player performs a corresponding directional action.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 has one consistent observation but only one attempt. It needs more validation to become fully verified. The previous ACTION4 attempt had an effect, so it's unlikely to have 'no effect' in the current state unless the player object is at the right edge, which it is not. Also, there are no 'no effect' attempts for ACTION4, so a setup sequence is not strictly required. The current position allows for movement to the right, which is the hypothesized effect of ACTION4. Prioritizing validation for actions that have shown an effect helps progress towards verification. Additionally, ACTION1 and ACTION5 have recent 'no effect' attempts, so they require a setup sequence first, which we cannot reliably construct as all movement actions are not yet fully verified. Thus, ACTION4 is the best choice for immediate testing.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION4 consistently moves the player object (Color 0) one pixel to the right and how it affects the 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14 and Color 13) and the Color 8 block. If it is consistent with the previous observation, it will contribute to verifying ACTION4. We also want to see if its effect on Color 8 block is consistent across different moves.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The player object (Color 0) is near the bottom-center of the play area. There is clear space to the right for the player to move, indicating that ACTION4 should result in movement. The orange collectible is to the upper right. The green obstacles are scattered, and none are immediately adjacent to the player's right in a way that would block movement. The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14/13) is expected to change, and we should pay close attention to its specific new state."
