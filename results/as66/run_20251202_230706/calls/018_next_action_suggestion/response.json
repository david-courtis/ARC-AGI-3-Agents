  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has one consistent observation but only one attempt. It needs more validation to become fully verified. The previous ACTION4 attempt had an effect, so it's unlikely to have 'no effect' in the current state unless the player object is at the right edge, which it is not. Also, there are no 'no effect' attempts for ACTION4, so a setup sequence is not strictly required. The current position allows for movement to the right, which is the hypothesized effect of ACTION4. Prioritizing validation for actions that have shown an effect helps progress towards verification. Additionally, ACTION1 and ACTION5 have recent 'no effect' attempts, so they require a setup sequence first, which we cannot reliably construct as all movement actions are not yet fully verified. Thus, ACTION4 is the best choice for immediate testing.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION4 consistently moves the player object (Color 0) one pixel to the right and how it affects the 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14 and Color 13) and the Color 8 block. If it is consistent with the previous observation, it will contribute to verifying ACTION4. We also want to see if its effect on Color 8 block is consistent across different moves.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player object (Color 0) is near the bottom-center of the play area. There is clear space to the right for the player to move, indicating that ACTION4 should result in movement. The orange collectible is to the upper right. The green obstacles are scattered, and none are immediately adjacent to the player's right in a way that would block movement. The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14/13) is expected to change, and we should pay close attention to its specific new state."
