  "new_definition": "ACTION1 moves the player object (Color 0) one pixel UP. This action also affects a dynamic 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14) which changes its position and orientation around the border of the play area. It also causes the movable block (Color 8) to move up.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The player object (Color 0) was not at the top boundary of the playable area and there was no blocking object directly above it. The 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 14) was present and not fully consumed, allowing for its transformation and relocation. The movable block (Color 8) was also able to move up as there was no blocking object above it.",
