BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n- Understanding these indicators is crucial - they tell you how many moves remain before failure\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay."

The player object (Color 0), the movable block (Col\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBackground: Color 6 (red)\nBorder: Yes (Color 8 (light blue)) - A solid light blue outer border that is two pixels thick. Inside this is another border of varying colors: light green (Color 3) on the top and bottom, and dark blue (Color 10) on the left and right. This creates a double border effect. There is also a pale pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the very top of the play area, just below the inner light green border.\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - Movement is likely constrained by the outer border (light blue, dark blue, light green).\n  - Movement might be constrained by the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' objects, preventing passage through them.\n  - The pale pink line at the top appears to be a UI element and not a movement constraint for the player within the main play area.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Player or main character: Color 0 (black) A U-shaped block with two visible 'feet' or protrusions downwards. Appears to be 2x2 pixels. (Role: Player or controllable entity)\n  - Obstacles/Terrain: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped pixel clusters (Role: Obstacles or decorative terrain features)\n  - Collectible/Target: Color 7 (orange) Single square pixel (Role: A collectible item, a goal, or a special interactable point.)\n  - Move Indicator Bar: Color 14 (pale pink) Thin horizontal line (1 pixel high, 12 pixels wide) (Role: A UI element indicating remaining moves or progress)\nSpatial structure: A grid-based enclosed area with irregular 'terrain' features. The central play area is a large red rectangle, bordered by a double-layered wall system. The objects (player, obstacles, collectible) all reside within this red area.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Identified a clear, multi-layered boundary system consisting of light blue, dark blue, and light green elements.\n- Identified a pale pink horizontal line at the top which is highly likely to be a UI element, specifically a move counter or progress indicator, due to its non-game-world appearance and typical placement of such elements.\n- The 'empty' space or background for interaction is Color 6 (red).\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What is the exact width of the pale pink move indicator bar when 'full'?\n- How does the pale pink move indicator bar change? Does it shrink, change color, or disappear in segments?\n- Can the player move freely over the red background (Color 6) areas?\n- Do the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' (Color 3) completely block movement, or do they only slow down/penalize the player?\n- What happens when the player interacts with the orange 'Collectible/Target' (Color 7)?\n- Does the black 'Player' (Color 0) have any specific interaction rules with the green 'Obstacles/Terrain' or the orange 'Collectible/Target'?\n- What are ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5?\n- How many \"moves\" are indicated by the current state of the pale pink bar?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS:\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 seems to be an action that can sometimes cause no visible change. More observations are needed to understand its full effect.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 moves the player (Color 0) one pixel downwards. It also affects the 'Move Indicator Bar', changing its position/color and consuming part of it. The Color 8 'block' likely moved down as well, but this is not visually confirmable from the provided images.\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 moves the player character (Color 0) one unit to the left. This action also consumes a 'move', which is indicated by a change in the 'Move Indicator Bar' (Color 13/14). The bar appears to rotate and change color/position upon move consumption.\"\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n   - These often appear at edges of the screen (top/bottom/sides)\n   - They change when successful moves are made\n   - Running out of moves causes game failure and reset!\n\nIf a movement action had NO EFFECT, the most likely reason is a WALL or BOUNDARY.\nLook carefully at the edges and any patterns that might indicate walls.\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf you have new questions to investigate, list them.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE in the new understanding\n\nDo NOT suggest updates for:\n- Minor refinements or rewording\n- Adding detail that doesn't change the core meaning\n- Speculation without strong evidence\n\nIf you DO suggest an update, keep it SIMPLE and CONCEPTUAL, e.g.:\n- \"moves player up, blocked by Color 0 walls\"\n- \"moves right within bounded play area\"\n- \"interacts with adjacent objects\"\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
