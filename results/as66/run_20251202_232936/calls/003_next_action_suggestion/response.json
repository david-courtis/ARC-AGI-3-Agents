  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 recently had no effect, so we must not retest it in the same state. Instead, we should prioritize testing an unobserved action. ACTION2 is an unobserved action, and we have no verified actions to create a setup sequence. Therefore, testing ACTION2 directly is the most efficient next step. This allows us to gather initial observations for ACTION2.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the effect of ACTION2, particularly if it's a movement action. This will provide new data points and potentially identify a working movement action, which can then be used in future setup sequences.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is neutral for testing movement actions, as there are no obvious obstacles preventing movement in any direction, and no nearby objects for interaction. The previous ACTION1 attempt had no effect, necessitating that any subsequent attempt of ACTION1 be done after a movement."
