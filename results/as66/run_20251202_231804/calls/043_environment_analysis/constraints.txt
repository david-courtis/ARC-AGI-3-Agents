- The blue border (Color 12) prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.
- The thin cyan border (Color 9) further restricts movement outside the main blue boundary.
- The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) prevents immediate downward movement into its area.
- The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), and (4,8)) will restrict downward movement into those specific areas, effectively acting as a temporary floor or obstacle depending on their position.
- The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space and blocking ACTION5.
- ACTION2 had NO EFFECT in previous observations, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint for downward movement at its current position. This could be an interaction with green blobs, or a temporary non-visual constraint, or simply the block being at the lowest available point for that action.
- ACTION5 had NO EFFECT when attempting to move into or adjacent to the 'Black Recess' (Color 0), confirming it as an impassable obstacle for that direction.
