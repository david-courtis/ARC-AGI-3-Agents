  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 is 1/3 consistent, meaning we only need two more consistent observations to verify it. It had an effect last time it was used, so it's a good candidate to test again. There are no recent 'NO EFFECT' attempts for ACTION4, so we can test it directly without a setup sequence. Testing ACTION4 should further clarify its behavior and allow us to verify it, reducing the number of pending actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to get a second consistent observation of ACTION4's behavior, specifically regarding the movement of the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to the right and its effect on the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14). This will bring us closer to verifying ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Moving Block' (Color 8) is at a position where previous moves have been successful in different directions, and it is not currently blocked to the right by any identified static obstacles such as the 'Black Recess' (Color 0). Since ACTION4 caused an effect last time and has no recent 'NO EFFECT' history, the current state is suitable for testing it immediately."
