  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been observed even once, making it the highest priority. It is always best to gather initial observations for completely untried actions. ACTION1 is still unverified and had no effect last time, so it needs a setup sequence. ACTION2 and ACTION3 have had effects and need more consistency checks but are lower priority than a completely unknown action. ACTION5 is also unknown but given the current state of the orange block near the center and with open space to its right, testing a cardinal movement first is logical.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discovering if ACTION4 moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to the right, and observing any other side effects (UI changes, dynamic boundaries). This will complete our initial exploration of cardinal movement actions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Moving Block' (Color 8) is positioned such that it has clear space to its right before encountering any large green blobs or borders, making it a good state to test rightward movement. The black object below it is also an unknown but does not appear to obstruct current movement options."
