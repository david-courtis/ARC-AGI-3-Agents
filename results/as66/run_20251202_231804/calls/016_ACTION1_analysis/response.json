  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was not at the top edge of the play area, allowing it to move upwards. The previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' from ACTION4 was present at (8,56), which then disappeared, and a new Color 14 object appeared at (4,8). This suggests a dynamic boundary or filling mechanic similar to what was observed with ACTION3 and ACTION4, but now affecting the bottom boundary from the top-left side.",

There was also a 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) at (8,56) from the previous action. The top UI element (Color 13) is still present. The top border is a blue (Color 12) block.",

    "The 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) continues its dynamic behavior, disappearing from one location (8,56) and appearing at another (4,8) after a successful vertical movement (upward in this case), suggesting a 'filling' from the top-left bottom boundary. This further supports the hypothesis of a progressive 'fill' mechanic tied to all movement actions, not just horizontal."
