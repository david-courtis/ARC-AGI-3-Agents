The previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) from the ACTION3 observation was present at (8,4), which then disappeared, and a new Color 14 object appeared at (8,56). This suggests a dynamic boundary or filling mechanic similar to what was observed with ACTION3, but now affecting the right-side bottom.",

    "The 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) continues its dynamic behavior, disappearing from one location (8,4) and appearing at another (8,56) after a successful horizontal movement (rightward in this case), suggesting a 'filling' from the bottom right side. This further supports the hypothesis of a progressive 'fill' mechanic tied to horizontal movement actions."
