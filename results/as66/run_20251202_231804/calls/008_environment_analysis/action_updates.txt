ACTION3: Moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit to the left. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) block to disappear and a new 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) block to appear at (8,4).
  Reason: The observed state change clearly shows the Color 8 block moving left, and a specific instance of Color 14 disappearing while another appears at a new location. This suggests a direct link in the action's effect.
