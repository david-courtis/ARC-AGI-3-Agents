1. Confirmed that ACTION3 specifically causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move left and triggers changes in the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14), causing it to disappear from its previous location (56,8) and reappear at a new location (8,4). This suggests a mechanic where ACTION3 (left movement) is linked to 'filling' from the left at the bottom, or clearing/replacing the bottom 'fill' based on player actions.
2. The 'New Bottom Bar' (Color 14) is not static but rather a dynamic element. Its previous instance at (56,8) disappeared and a new larger instance appeared at (8,4) indicating a dynamic 'fill' or 'floor' mechanic that is affected by player actions and can change its position/size.
