  "reasoning": "All actions are currently unknown. We should start by testing a fundamental movement action. ACTION1 (Move UP) is a good starting point as it will reveal if we can move in that direction.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Observing if ACTION1 causes movement, if it's blocked by the edge, or if it has another effect entirely. This will help us understand the game's movement mechanics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state is a good starting point as we are not at any obvious 'wall' for moving up in the immediate vicinity of the central entity. The entity is surrounded by a brown color, which might be traversable terrain. There are also green and orange patches. It seems like the agent is at the bottom of the screen, so moving up is a good choice."
