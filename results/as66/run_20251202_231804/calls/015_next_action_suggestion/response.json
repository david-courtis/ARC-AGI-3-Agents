  "reasoning": "ACTION1 had no effect in its last attempt. The rule states that if an action had no effect in the current state, we must use a setup sequence of verified movement actions to reach a different position before retrying it. Although ACTION4 is not fully verified (1/3 consistent), it is the most consistent movement action we have and its effect (moving right) is clear. Moving right twice should place the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) in a significantly different horizontal position, away from the bottom boundary fill (Color 14) that recently appeared on the right. This new position should provide a fresh context to test ACTION1 (Move UP) and assess if its previous 'NO EFFECT' was due to a spatial constraint.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION1 again after a setup sequence, we aim to: 1. Verify if ACTION1 moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) upwards. 2. Understand what constraints might be preventing ACTION1 from having an effect (e.g., proximity to the top border, presence of another object). 3. Potentially gather more consistent observations for ACTION1. 4. Collect more observations for ACTION4 to move it closer to verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Moving Block' (Color 8, orange) is currently at a position where its last attempt to move up (ACTION1) had no effect. ACTION4 has shown a consistent movement to the right, and using it twice should provide a sufficient positional change. The 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) is on the right side. Moving the block further right might clear it from this dynamic boundary's influence, allowing for a clearer test of ACTION1."
