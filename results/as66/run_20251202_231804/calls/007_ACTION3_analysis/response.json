The 'New Bottom Bar' (Color 14 rectangular block) at (56,8) disappeared and a new color 14 block appeared at (8,4), indicating a dynamic change in boundary or environmental conditions.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION3 moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit to the left. This action also affects the 'New Bottom Bar' which seems to be a dynamic boundary or UI element, causing it to disappear while a new Color 14 block often appears at row 8, column 4.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": null,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was not at the left edge of the play area, allowing it to move left. The previous 'New Bottom Bar' from the ACTION2 observation was present, which then disappeared, and a new Color 14 object appeared. This could suggest a game mechanic where a successful 'move' action affects other elements in the game, possibly a move counter or a 'filling' mechanic.",

  "context_description": "The game state contained a 'Moving Block' (Color 8) at (28, 40) within the red play area, not adjacent to the left border. There was also a 'New Bottom Bar' (Color 14) at (56,8) from the previous action. The top UI element (Color 13) is still present. The left border is a blue (Color 12) block.",

  "environment_updates": [
    "Confirmed that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) is a player-controlled or game-controlled object and can move horizontally.",
    "The 'New Bottom Bar' is not permanent; it can disappear and be replaced by other Color 14 objects, suggesting a dynamic environmental or counter element rather than a fixed boundary.",
    "The appearance of 'Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)' suggests a new type of dynamic boundary or environmental element, possibly related to filling the left side.",
    "The UI elements in the top (Color 13) and bottom region are consistently being affected by successful actions, reinforcing the idea of a move counter / progress bar.",
    "The semantic hint was correct that this action moves left."
