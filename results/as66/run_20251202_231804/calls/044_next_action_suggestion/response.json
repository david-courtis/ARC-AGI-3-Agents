  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 needs 2 more consistent observations to be verified. The current position of the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) at (32,40) is not adjacent to any known obstacles that would prevent upward movement. It is also not in the same state as a previous no-effect attempt for ACTION1.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validation of ACTION1's effect on the 'Moving Block' movement and the 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) behavior. We want to confirm it consistently moves the block up and places Color 14 at (4,8).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Moving Block' (Color 8) is at (32,40). It has free space above it. The black recess (Color 0) is below and to the left. Green blobs (Color 3) are scattered around but not in an immediate blocking position for upward movement. This seems like a good state to test upward movement."
