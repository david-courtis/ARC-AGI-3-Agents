Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit upwards. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) to disappear and a new Color 14 block to appear at (4,8), at the top-left section of the bottom boundary.
  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit downwards. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) at (8,56) to disappear and a new Color 14 block to appear at (56,8).
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit to the left. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) block to disappear and a new 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) block to appear at (8,4).
  ACTION4: 2/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit to the right. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) block to disappear and a new 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) block to appear at (8,56).
  ACTION5: VERIFIED - None

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Multiple (Color 12 (blue), Color 9 (cyan), Color 10 (pink), Color 3 (green), Color 4 (yellow), Color 14 (dark blue)))
  Description: A thick blue border (Color 12) frames the central playing area on the top, left, and right sides. Outside the blue border, there's another thin cyan border (Color 9) on the left, top, and right. Below the main play area, there are fixed lines of pink (Color 10), green (Color 3), and yellow (Color 4) which form a lower UI/boundary structure. A thin pink border (Color 10) and a thin green border (Color 3) are visible at the very top. The bottom boundary dynamically shows Color 14 blocks, with their position and presence dependent on actions.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  A central rectangular play area enclosed by distinct static and dynamic borders. There's a clear static top UI area, a robust static multi-layered UI/boundary structure below the main play area, and a highly dynamic 'fill' or 'floor' element (Color 14) that responds to actions within the play area.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed the existence and function of the primary blue boundaries (Color 12) surrounding the play area.
  - Identified a clear top UI region (row 0) where 'move counter' elements appear.
  - Identified a robust bottom UI/boundary structure composed of pink (Color 10), green (Color 3), and yellow (Color 4) lines.
  - Discovery of a new object (Color 13 rectangular block) appearing in the top UI confirms the presence of dynamic UI elements, possibly a move counter or status indicator, which is affected by successful actions.
  - Discovery of a second new object (Color 14 rectangular block) at the very bottom of the screen, which suggests a new boundary or a 'fill' mechanic at the bottom of the play area.
  - Identified a specific dynamic element at (4,8) (a single pixel that changed from Color 14 to Color 12), suggesting either a dynamic boundary corner or another type of counter/status indicator tied to specific locations.
  - Established with high confidence that the orange block (Color 8) is an active, player-controlled, or game-controlled object due to its movement via ACTION2.
  - Confirmed that ACTION3 specifically causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move left and triggers changes in the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14), causing it to disappear from its previous location (56,8) and reappear at a new location (8,4). This suggests a mechanic where ACTION3 (left movement) is linked to 'filling' from the left at the bottom, or clearing/replacing the bottom 'fill' based on player actions.
  - The 'New Bottom Bar' (Color 14) is not static but rather a dynamic element. Its previous instance at (56,8) disappeared and a new larger instance appeared at (8,4) indicating a dynamic 'fill' or 'floor' mechanic that is affected by player actions and can change its position/size.
  - Confirmed that ACTION4 causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move one unit to the right.
  - Confirmation that the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) is a highly dynamic element, as ACTION4 caused its previous instance at (8,4) to disappear and a new instance to appear at (8,56). This further reinforces its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that is responsive to player actions and can occupy different horizontal segments of the bottom boundary.
  - Confirmed that ACTION5 is unable to move the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) in its current state, indicating a new, unknown constraint for this action or direction of movement. This implies either a new type of boundary, an interaction with the green blobs (Color 3), or the black recess (Color 0), or a directional movement not yet defined for ACTION5.
  - Identified the 'Black Recess' (Color 0) as a new, static object within the play area, likely serving as an obstacle or a specific interaction point.
  - Confirmed ACTION1 causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move one unit upwards.
  - Clarified behavior of the 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14): after ACTION1, it appears at (4,8) (a section near the top-left of the bottom boundary), confirming its dynamic nature and responsiveness to vertical movement of the 'Moving Block'.
  - Confirmation that the static 'Black Recess' (Color 0) is a direct impediment for movement, as ACTION5, when attempting to move into its space (or directly next to it), resulted in no effect. This significantly solidifies its role as an unpassable obstacle.
  - Confirmed that the 'Black Recess' (Color 0) is a direct impediment for movement for ACTION5, solidifying its role as an unpassable obstacle in a specific direction.
  - Confirmed that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked from moving downward by ACTION2. This indicates a new, currently unknown, constraint to downward movement beyond the previously identified floor elements. It could be an ephemeral obstacle, a specific interaction with another object, or simply its current position preventing further downward travel.
  - The 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) now consistently appears as a 4x48 block at (8,56) after ACTION4, confirming its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that shifts its horizontal position based on the specific action taken. This further establishes its dynamic nature as a movable floor piece rather than a continuous fill, suggesting distinct segments are activated by different actions.
  - Clarified behavior of 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) after ACTION1: it consistently appears as a 4x48 block at (4,8) (a section near the top-left of the bottom boundary), confirming its dynamic nature and responsiveness to vertical movement of the 'Moving Block'. This is a consistent 4x48 block at a specific horizontal segment triggered by ACTION1.
  - Confirmed that ACTION2 successfully moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit downwards.
  - Clarified the dynamic behavior of 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) for ACTION2: it consistently moves from (8,56) to (56,8) after a downward movement of the 'Moving Block' (Color 8). This confirms specific spatial shifts for each action's trigger.
  - Confirmed the consistent behavior of the 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) after ACTION2: it consistently appears as a 4x48 block at (56,8) after a downward movement of the 'Moving Block' (Color 8), confirming specific spatial shifts for each action's trigger.
  - The orange (Color 8) 'Moving Block' successfully moved one unit downwards with ACTION2, providing a specific instance of unblocked downward movement, which helps in understanding conditions under which previous ACTION2 attempts were blocked.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - The blue border (Color 12) likely prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.
  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents downward movement.
  - The thin cyan border (Color 9) further restricts movement outside the main blue boundary.
  - The newly appeared bottom bar (Color 14) at (56,8) will likely restrict any further downward movement of objects into that area.
  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents immediate downward movement.
  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (either at (56,8) or (8,4)) will restrict downward movement into those areas, effectively acting as a new floor or obstacle depending on their position.
  - The blue border (Color 12) prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.
  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) prevents downward movement.
  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8) or (8,4) or (8,56)) will restrict downward movement into those areas, effectively acting as a new floor or obstacle depending on their position.
  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) prevents immediate downward movement into its area.
  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8), (8,4), or (8,56)) will restrict downward movement into those specific areas, effectively acting as a temporary floor or obstacle depending on their position.
  - ACTION5 had NO EFFECT, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint to perform this action.
  - The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) likely acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space.
  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), and (4,8)) will restrict downward movement into those specific areas, effectively acting as a temporary floor or obstacle depending on their position.
  - The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space.
  - ACTION5 had NO EFFECT, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint for that specific action in that direction. This strongly suggests a boundary or obstacle in the intended direction of ACTION5.
  - ACTION5 had NO EFFECT because the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by the 'Black Recess' (Color 0) when attempting to move into or adjacent to its space. This confirms the 'Black Recess' as an impassable obstacle for the direction of ACTION5.
  - ACTION2 had NO EFFECT, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint for downward movement at its current position.
  - The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space and blocking ACTION5.
  - ACTION2 had NO EFFECT, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint for downward movement at its current position. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be an interaction with green blobs, or a temporary non-visual constraint).
  - ACTION2 had NO EFFECT in previous observations, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint for downward movement at its current position. This could be an interaction with green blobs, or a temporary non-visual constraint, or simply the block being at the lowest available point for that action.
  - ACTION5 had NO EFFECT when attempting to move into or adjacent to the 'Black Recess' (Color 0), confirming it as an impassable obstacle for that direction.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Black Recess (Color 0)

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red) Large rectangle (Role hypothesis: The main game area where actions take place.)
      Evidence: It takes up most of the central screen and objects move within it.
  - Moving Block: Color 8 (orange) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled or actively game-controlled object.)
      Evidence: It moves in response to player actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4).
  - Obstacle/Target (Green Blobs): Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs/clusters (Role hypothesis: Obstacles, targets, or collectible items.)
      Evidence: Their irregular placement suggests they are not just background; their interaction with the moving block is yet to be fully understood.
  - Move Counter/Status Indicator (Top UI): Color 13 (pink) Thin rectangle/line (Role hypothesis: Move counter or turn indicator.)
      Evidence: Appears in a dedicated UI region (row 0), suggesting it tracks game state like moves or score. Changed after successful action.
  - Static Bottom Boundary (Pink): Color 10 (pink) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role hypothesis: Fixed bottom boundary or a UI element.)
      Evidence: It remains static at the bottom of the play area, under the dynamic Color 14 blocks. It consistently prevents immediate downward movement.
  - External UI Element (Green Line): Color 3 (green) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Possible score indicator or game state display.)
      Evidence: Part of a fixed UI structure below the main play area.
  - External UI Element (Yellow Line): Color 4 (yellow) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Possible score indicator or game state display.)
      Evidence: Part of a fixed UI structure below the main play area.
  - Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (variable size/position) (Role hypothesis: Temporary floor or 'fill' mechanic indicating progress, current game state, or remaining moves. It responds to specific actions by appearing at different horizontal segments of the bottom boundary and restricting downward movement.)
      Evidence: Its appearance, disappearance, and change in position are directly tied to successful player actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4). It acts as an obstacle to downward movement into its area due to its temporary nature and variable position.
  - Static Play Area Border: Color 12 (blue) Thick lines forming a frame (Role hypothesis: Immutable boundary of the main play area.)
      Evidence: It defines the main playable area and consistently prevents movement in the up, left, and right directions.
  - Outer Boundary/Frame (Cyan): Color 9 (cyan) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Outermost static boundary, possibly defining the entire screen or a larger game zone.)
      Evidence: It frames the entire game view and is consistently present, restricting movement further than the blue static border.
  - Black Recess: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (4x2) (Role hypothesis: Static internal obstacle or a specific interaction point.)
      Evidence: It consistently blocks movement in its direction (e.g., ACTION5), confirming its role as an impassable obstacle.
  - Top UI Border (Pink): Color 10 (pink) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Fixed UI element, possibly part of a larger score or status display.)
      Evidence: Consistently appears at the very top, separate from dynamic play.
  - Top UI Border (Green): Color 3 (green) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Fixed UI element, possibly part of a larger score or status display.)
      Evidence: Consistently appears at the very top, separate from dynamic play.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What specific condition or object is now blocking the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) from moving downwards via ACTION2, if it were to be blocked again in the future? (Previous blockages need further investigation if they reoccur).
  - What is the exact function of the Color 13 block that appeared in the top UI? Can it decrease or disappear?
  - What is the complete pattern of movement for the Color 14 block? Does it always disappear from one location and appear at another specific location after certain actions, or is there a progressive 'filling' mechanic? (We've seen (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), (4,8) triggered by different actions).
  - What is the purpose of the color change at (4,8) from Color 14 to Color 12 observed in an earlier step? Is it tied to successful moves, a timer, or proximity to another object?
  - Do the green 'blobs' (Color 3) act as obstacles, targets, or are they collectible items? How do they interact with the 'Moving Block' (Color 8)?
  - What is the maximum number of times ACTION2, ACTION3, or ACTION4 can be performed before the game state changes drastically or ends?
  - Do the bottommost UI elements (Color 3 green, Color 4 yellow) indicate score, progress, or remaining turns?

Recent Observations:
  - The 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) consistently changes position in response to any successful 'move' action.
  - The 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) now consistently appears as a 4x48 block at (56,8) after ACTION2, confirming its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that shifts its horizontal position based on the specific action taken. This further establishes its dynamic nature as a movable floor piece rather than a continuous fill, suggesting distinct segments are activated by different actions.
  - The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) is confirmed as an obstacle to downward movement, as its presence directly below the moving block prevented ACTION2 from having an effect in a previous observation.
  - The 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) consistently appears as a 4x48 block at (8,4) after ACTION3, confirming its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that shifts its horizontal position based on the specific action taken. This further establishes its dynamic nature as a movable floor piece rather than a continuous fill, suggesting distinct segments are activated by different actions.
  - The 'Moving Block' (Color 8) moved from (28,40) to (32,40).
