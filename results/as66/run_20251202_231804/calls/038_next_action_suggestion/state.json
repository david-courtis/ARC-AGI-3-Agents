      "Confirmed that ACTION3 specifically causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move left and triggers changes in the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14), causing it to disappear from its previous location (56,8) and reappear at a new location (8,4). This suggests a mechanic where ACTION3 (left movement) is linked to 'filling' from the left at the bottom, or clearing/replacing the bottom 'fill' based on player actions.",

This further reinforces its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that is responsive to player actions and can occupy different horizontal segments of the bottom boundary.",
      "Confirmed that ACTION5 is unable to move the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) in its current state, indicating a new, unknown constraint for this action or direction of movement. This implies either a new type of boundary, an interaction with the green blobs (Color 3), or the black recess (Color 0), or a directional movement not yet defined for ACTION5.",

      "Confirmed that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked from moving downward by ACTION2. This indicates a new, currently unknown, constraint to downward movement beyond the previously identified floor elements. It could be an ephemeral obstacle, a specific interaction with another object, or simply its current position preventing further downward travel.",
      "The 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) now consistently appears as a 4x48 block at (8,56) after ACTION4, confirming its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that shifts its horizontal position based on the specific action taken. This further establishes its dynamic nature as a movable floor piece rather than a continuous fill, suggesting distinct segments are activated by different actions.",
      "Clarified behavior of 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) after ACTION1: it consistently appears as a 4x48 block at (4,8) (a section near the top-left of the bottom boundary), confirming its dynamic nature and responsiveness to vertical movement of the 'Moving Block'. This is a consistent 4x48 block at a specific horizontal segment triggered by ACTION1.",
      "Confirmed that ACTION2 successfully moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit downwards.",
