      "reasoning": "The recent observations provide strong evidence for the precise visual effects of ACTION2 beyond just moving the Color 8 block. It's clear that successful moves are tied to specific UI feedback and environmental changes. The appearance of the large Color 14 block at the bottom is a significant environmental change that needs to be part of the action's definition."
