ACTION2: Moves an active Color 8 object downwards. This action also triggers dynamic UI changes: the appearance of a Color 13 block in the top UI, the appearance of a new Color 14 block at the bottom as a potential new floor/constraint, and a color change at (4,8).
  Reason: The recent observations provide strong evidence for the precise visual effects of ACTION2 beyond just moving the Color 8 block. It's clear that successful moves are tied to specific UI feedback and environmental changes. The appearance of the large Color 14 block at the bottom is a significant environmental change that needs to be part of the action's definition.
