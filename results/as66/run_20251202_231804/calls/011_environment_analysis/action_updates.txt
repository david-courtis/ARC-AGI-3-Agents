ACTION4: Moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit to the right. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) block to disappear and a new 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) block to appear at (8,56).
  Reason: The recent observation directly showed the Color 8 block moving right due to ACTION4, and simultaneously the Color 14 block disappearing from (8,4) and appearing at (8,56).
