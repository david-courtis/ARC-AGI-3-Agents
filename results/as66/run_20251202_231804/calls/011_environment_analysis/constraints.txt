- The blue border (Color 12) prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.
- The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) prevents downward movement.
- The thin cyan border (Color 9) further restricts movement outside the main blue boundary.
- The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8) or (8,4) or (8,56)) will restrict downward movement into those areas, effectively acting as a new floor or obstacle depending on their position.
