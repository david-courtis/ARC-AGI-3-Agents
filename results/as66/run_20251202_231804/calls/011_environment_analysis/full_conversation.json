    "content": "You are an environment analyst studying an unknown game world.\n\nYour SOLE FOCUS is understanding the ENVIRONMENT - not the actions.\n\nCRITICAL: YOUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG!\n- Previous object identifications and role hypotheses are TENTATIVE and may need correction\n- If action results contradict your current understanding, UPDATE IT\n- You can and SHOULD replace incorrect objects/roles with better interpretations\n- Every analysis is an opportunity to REFINE or CORRECT the environment model\n\nYou must discover and document:\n1. BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (112), upper_right_playarea (112), lower_left_playarea (96), lower_right_playarea (96), top_ui (13) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [4-59]\n\nObject-level changes: APPEARED: 1 objects\n  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56)\nDISAPPEARED: 1 objects\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)\nMOVED: 1 objects\n  ~ Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24) moved right\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING (MAY BE WRONG - UPDATE IF NEEDED):\nBackground: Color 6 (red)\nBorder: Yes (Color 12 (blue)) - A thick blue border (Color 12) frames the central playing area on the top, left, and right sides. The bottom border is a thick pink line (Color 10), and below that is a green line (Color 3), then a yellow line (Color 4). Outside the blue border, there's another thin cyan border (Color 9) on the left, top, and right. The bottom boundary dynamically changes with new Color 14 blocks appearing.\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - The blue border (Color 12) likely prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.\n  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents downward movement.\n  - The thin cyan border (Color 9) further restricts movement outside the main blue boundary.\n  - The newly appeared bottom bar (Color 14) at (56,8) will likely restrict any further downward movement of objects into that area.\n  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents immediate downward movement.\n  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (either at (56,8) or (8,4)) will restrict downward movement into those areas, effectively acting as a new floor or obstacle depending on their position.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Playable Area: Color 6 (red) Large rectangle (Role: The main game area where actions take place.)\n  - Moving Block: Color 8 (orange) Rectangular block (Role: Player or controllable object.)\n  - Obstacle/Target: Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs/clusters (Role: Obstacles, targets, or collectible items.)\n  - Move Counter/Status Indicator: Color 13 (pink) Thin rectangle/line (Role: Move counter or turn indicator.)\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor: Color 10 (pink) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role: Bottom boundary marker or a different UI element.)\n  - External UI Element (bottommost): Color 3 (green) Thin horizontal line (Role: Possible score indicator or game state display.)\n  - External UI Element (bottommost secondary): Color 4 (yellow) Thin horizontal line (Role: Possible score indicator or game state display.)\n  - Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (Role: Environmental condition, new game phase indicator, or a 'fill' mechanic from the bottom.)\n  - Static Corner Marker: Color 12 (blue) Small square (1x1) (Role: Boundary marker for the play area or a static UI element.)\nSpatial structure: A central rectangular play area enclosed by distinct colored borders. There's a clear UI area above and below the main play area. The bottom boundary appears to be dynamic, potentially filling from the bottom up.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Confirmed the existence and function of the primary blue boundaries (Color 12) surrounding the play area.\n- Identified a clear top UI region (row 0) where 'move counter' elements appear.\n- Identified a robust bottom UI/boundary structure composed of pink (Color 10), green (Color 3), and yellow (Color 4) lines.\n- Discovery of a new object (Color 13 rectangular block) appearing in the top UI confirms the presence of dynamic UI elements, possibly a move counter or status indicator, which is affected by successful actions.\n- Discovery of a second new object (Color 14 rectangular block) at the very bottom of the screen, which suggests a new boundary or a 'fill' mechanic at the bottom of the play area.\n- Identified a specific dynamic element at (4,8) (a single pixel that changed from Color 14 to Color 12), suggesting either a dynamic boundary corner or another type of counter/status indicator tied to specific locations.\n- Established with high confidence that the orange block (Color 8) is an active, player-controlled, or game-controlled object due to its movement via ACTION2.\n- Confirmed that ACTION3 specifically causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move left and triggers changes in the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14), causing it to disappear from its previous location (56,8) and reappear at a new location (8,4). This suggests a mechanic where ACTION3 (left movement) is linked to 'filling' from the left at the bottom, or clearing/replacing the bottom 'fill' based on player actions.\n- The 'New Bottom Bar' (Color 14) is not static but rather a dynamic element. Its previous instance at (56,8) disappeared and a new larger instance appeared at (8,4) indicating a dynamic 'fill' or 'floor' mechanic that is affected by player actions and can change its position/size.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What is the exact function of the Color 13 block that appeared in the top UI? Is it a single-use counter or part of a larger system?\n- What is the precise trigger and behavior logic for the Color 14 blocks. Does it 'fill' the bottom, or does it represent collected items or progress?\n- What is the complete pattern of movement for the Color 14 block? Does it always disappear from one location and appear at another specific location after certain actions?\n- What is the purpose of the color change at (4,8) from Color 14 to Color 12? Is it tied to successful moves, a timer, or proximity to another object (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS)?\n- Do the green 'blobs' (Color 3) act as obstacles, targets, or are they collectible items?\n- Are there any other internal obstacles or specific movement rules besides the borders?\n- What is the maximum number of times ACTION2 or ACTION3 can be performed before the game state changes drastically or ends?\n- Do the bottommost UI elements (Color 3 green, Color 4 yellow) indicate score, progress, or remaining turns?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION2: \"Moves an active Color 8 object downwards. This action also triggers dynamic UI changes: the appearance of a Color 13 block in the top UI, the appearance of a new Color 14 block at the bottom as a potential new floor/constraint, and a color change at (4,8).\"\n  ACTION3: \"Moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit to the left. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) block to disappear and a new 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) block to appear at (8,4).\"\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
