Describe what happened when the action was taken\n2. Build/update a definition of what this action does\n3. Note any objects or environment features involved\n4. Track whether the action had any visible effect\n\nIMPORTANT - CURRENT UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG:\n- The environment understanding provided is TENTATIVE and may be incorrect\n- Object identifications and role hypotheses could be wrong\n- If what you observe CONTRADICTS the current understanding, note this!\n- Your observations help REFINE or CORRECT the environment model\n\nIMPORTANT - UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS:\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that count SUCCESSFUL moves\n- When an action HAS EFFECT (moves something), the move counter typically decreases\n- Changes in UI elements (e.g., red dots disappearing) indicate move consumption, NOT action effects\n- Focus on what happened in the PLAY AREA, not just UI changes\n- Running out of moves (counter reaches zero) causes game failure and reset\n\nBe precise and EVIDENCE-BASED. If you're uncertain, say so.\nMark any guesses without evidence as uncertain."

It could be that there was no active object, no object to move, or it was at an edge/boundary/obstacle preventing movement in the 'up' direction if the semantic hint is correct.\nConsistent: None"
