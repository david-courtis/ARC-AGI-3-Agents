  "reasoning": "ACTION5 previously had no effect from the current position. To avoid repeating a no-effect action in the same state, a setup sequence is required to move the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to a new position. Since ACTION4 has one consistent observation, it's the most 'verified' directional action available (even if not fully verified, it's the strongest hint we have for reliable movement). By moving the Color 8 block twice to the right, we change its interaction context with the 'Black Recess' (Color 0) and the green blobs (Color 3), giving ACTION5 a fresh opportunity to show an effect. We choose ACTION4 twice to move it significantly away from its current position relative to the black recess and green blobs.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe a concrete effect from ACTION5 by changing the 'Moving Block's' position relative to other objects. This will help us understand ACTION5's function (e.g., interaction logic, rotation, or another type of movement) and the conditions under which it operates. Specifically, we want to see if the lack of effect was due to its proximity to the black recess or other obstacles.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Moving Block' (Color 8) is currently positioned such that ACTION5 had no effect. It's near the top right green blob and top of the black recess. Moving it rightward will likely place it in a more open space or in proximity to different green blobs, potentially enabling ACTION5 or revealing its interaction with these new environmental features. All actions except ACTION4 are less verified or have had recent 'no effect' attempts. ACTION4 has shown a consistent movement right in its only effect observation, making it the most reliable for a setup sequence."
