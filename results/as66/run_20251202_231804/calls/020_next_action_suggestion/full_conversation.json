Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state!

Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration.

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple (Color 12 (blue), Color 9 (cyan), Color 10 (pink), Color 3 (green), Color 4 (yellow)))\n  Description: A thick blue border (Color 12) frames the central playing area on the top, left, and right sides. The bottom boundary dynamically shows Color 14 blocks. Outside the blue border, there's another thin cyan border (Color 9) on the left, top, and right. Below the main play area, there are fixed lines of pink (Color 10), green (Color 3), and yellow (Color 4) which form a lower UI/boundary structure.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A central rectangular play area enclosed by distinct static and dynamic borders. There's a clear UI area above and a complex, multi-layered UI/boundary structure below the main play area. The bottom boundary appears to be highly dynamic, with 'fill' elements (Color 14) that change based on actions.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the existence and function of the primary blue boundaries (Color 12) surrounding the play area.\n  - Identified a clear top UI region (row 0) where 'move counter' elements appear.\n  - Identified a robust bottom UI/boundary structure composed of pink (Color 10), green (Color 3), and yellow (Color 4) lines.\n  - Discovery of a new object (Color 13 rectangular block) appearing in the top UI confirms the presence of dynamic UI elements, possibly a move counter or status indicator, which is affected by successful actions.\n  - Discovery of a second new object (Color 14 rectangular block) at the very bottom of the screen, which suggests a new boundary or a 'fill' mechanic at the bottom of the play area.\n  - Identified a specific dynamic element at (4,8) (a single pixel that changed from Color 14 to Color 12), suggesting either a dynamic boundary corner or another type of counter/status indicator tied to specific locations.\n  - Established with high confidence that the orange block (Color 8) is an active, player-controlled, or game-controlled object due to its movement via ACTION2.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION3 specifically causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move left and triggers changes in the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14), causing it to disappear from its previous location (56,8) and reappear at a new location (8,4). This suggests a mechanic where ACTION3 (left movement) is linked to 'filling' from the left at the bottom, or clearing/replacing the bottom 'fill' based on player actions.\n  - The 'New Bottom Bar' (Color 14) is not static but rather a dynamic element. Its previous instance at (56,8) disappeared and a new larger instance appeared at (8,4) indicating a dynamic 'fill' or 'floor' mechanic that is affected by player actions and can change its position/size.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION4 causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move one unit to the right.\n  - Confirmation that the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) is a highly dynamic element, as ACTION4 caused its previous instance at (8,4) to disappear and a new instance to appear at (8,56). This further reinforces its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that is responsive to player actions and can occupy different horizontal segments of the bottom boundary.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION5 is unable to move the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) in its current state, indicating a new, unknown constraint for this action or direction of movement. This implies either a new type of boundary, an interaction with the green blobs (Color 3), or the black recess (Color 0), or a directional movement not yet defined for ACTION5.\n  - Identified the 'Black Recess' (Color 0) as a new, static object within the play area, likely serving as an obstacle or a specific interaction point.\n  - Confirmed ACTION1 causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move one unit upwards.\n  - Clarified behavior of the 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14): after ACTION1, it appears at (4,8) (a section near the top-left of the bottom boundary), confirming its dynamic nature and responsiveness to vertical movement of the 'Moving Block'.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The blue border (Color 12) likely prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.\n  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents downward movement.\n  - The thin cyan border (Color 9) further restricts movement outside the main blue boundary.\n  - The newly appeared bottom bar (Color 14) at (56,8) will likely restrict any further downward movement of objects into that area.\n  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents immediate downward movement.\n  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (either at (56,8) or (8,4)) will restrict downward movement into those areas, effectively acting as a new floor or obstacle depending on their position.\n  - The blue border (Color 12) prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.\n  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) prevents downward movement.\n  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8) or (8,4) or (8,56)) will restrict downward movement into those areas, effectively acting as a new floor or obstacle depending on their position.\n  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) prevents immediate downward movement into its area.\n  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8), (8,4), or (8,56)) will restrict downward movement into those specific areas, effectively acting as a temporary floor or obstacle depending on their position.\n  - ACTION5 had NO EFFECT, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint to perform this action.\n  - The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) likely acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space.\n  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), and (4,8)) will restrict downward movement into those specific areas, effectively acting as a temporary floor or obstacle depending on their position.\n  - The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Black Recess (Color 0)\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red) Large rectangle (Role hypothesis: The main game area where actions take place.)\n      Evidence: Entities move within this colored region; it fills the majority of the screen.\n  - Moving Block: Color 8 (orange) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled or actively game-controlled object.)\n      Evidence: Observed moving in response to ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4.\n  - Obstacle/Target (Green Blobs): Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs/clusters (Role hypothesis: Obstacles, targets, or collectible items.)\n      Evidence: Static presence within the play area, often surrounding the moving block's path. Their role is still unconfirmed but they definitely are not background.\n  - Move Counter/Status Indicator (Top UI): Color 13 (pink) Thin rectangle/line (Role hypothesis: Move counter or turn indicator.)\n      Evidence: Appears in the dedicated top UI region and has changed state after successful actions, suggesting it tracks progress or turns.\n  - Bottom UI Boundary (Pink): Color 10 (pink) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role hypothesis: Fixed bottom boundary or a UI element.)\n      Evidence: Part of a static, multi-layered UI structure at the bottom; prevents downward movement.\n  - External UI Element (Green Line): Color 3 (green) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Possible score indicator or game state display.)\n      Evidence: Part of a static, multi-layered UI structure at the bottom, its function isn't clearly defined yet but its position suggests UI.\n  - External UI Element (Yellow Line): Color 4 (yellow) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Possible score indicator or game state display.)\n      Evidence: Part of a static, multi-layered UI structure at the bottom, its function isn't clearly defined yet but its position suggests UI.\n  - Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Temporary floor or 'fill' mechanic indicating progress, current game state, or remaining moves.)\n      Evidence: Appears and disappears at different bottom coordinates (e.g., (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), and now (4,8)) in response to actions, suggesting a programmatic state change or 'filling' from an edge. Previously described as 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill'.\n  - Static Play Area Border: Color 12 (blue) Thick lines forming a frame (Role hypothesis: Immutable boundary of the main play area.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present on top, left, and right sides; prevents movement through it.\n  - Outer Boundary/Frame (Cyan): Color 9 (cyan) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Outermost static boundary, possibly defining the entire screen or a larger game zone.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present as the outermost layer; objects do not appear to move beyond it.\n  - Black Recess: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (4x2) (Role hypothesis: Static internal obstacle or a specific interaction point.)\n      Evidence: Static presence within the play area, likely blocking movement or serving as a target/goal.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact function of the Color 13 block that appeared in the top UI? Can it decrease or disappear?\n  - What is the precise trigger and behavior logic for the Color 14 blocks? Does it 'fill' the bottom, or does it represent collected items or progress? What determines its horizontal position (e.g., (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), (4,8)) after an action?\n  - What is the complete pattern of movement for the Color 14 block? Does it always disappear from one location and appear at another specific location after certain actions, or is there a progressive 'filling' mechanic?\n  - What is the purpose of the color change at (4,8) from Color 14 to Color 12 observed in an earlier step? Is it tied to successful moves, a timer, or proximity to another object?\n  - Do the green 'blobs' (Color 3) act as obstacles, targets, or are they collectible items? How do they interact with the 'Moving Block' (Color 8)?\n  - What is the maximum number of times ACTION2, ACTION3, or ACTION4 can be performed before the game state changes drastically or ends?\n  - Do the bottommost UI elements (Color 3 green, Color 4 yellow) indicate score, progress, or remaining turns?\n  - What exactly is ACTION5 attempting to do, and what specific constraint blocked it in this instance?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Moving Block: Color 8 (orange) Rectangular block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - New Bottom Bar: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block: Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) continues its dynamic behavior, disappearing from one location (8,4) and appearing at another (8,56) after a successful horizontal movement (rightward in this case), suggesting a 'filling' from the bottom right side. This further supports the hypothesis of a progressive 'fill' mechanic tied to horizontal movement actions.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION1 moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) upwards.\n  - The 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) continues its dynamic behavior, disappearing from one location (8,56) and appearing at another (4,8) after a successful vertical movement (upward in this case), suggesting a 'filling' from the top-left bottom boundary. This further supports the hypothesis of a progressive 'fill' mechanic tied to all movement actions, not just horizontal.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION5 is context-dependent and does not always produce an effect.\n  - The lack of effect further suggests ACTION5 might be an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action that requires specific conditions (e.g., an adjacent target or a particular state) to produce a visible change.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION5: 2 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
