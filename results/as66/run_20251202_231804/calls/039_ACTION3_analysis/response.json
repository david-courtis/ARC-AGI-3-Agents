  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was at (28,40) and there was no obstacle to its left capable of preventing movement in that direction. The presence of the 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) at (56,8) triggered its disappearance and the appearance of a new segment at (8,4), which is a consistent dynamic behavior for this object in response to any successful 'move'.",

    "The 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) consistently appears as a 4x48 block at (8,4) after ACTION3, confirming its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that shifts its horizontal position based on the specific action taken. This further establishes its dynamic nature as a movable floor piece rather than a continuous fill, suggesting distinct segments are activated by different actions."
