    "What is the complete pattern of movement for the Color 14 block? Does it always disappear from one location and appear at another specific location after certain actions, or is there a progressive 'filling' mechanic?",

      "reasoning": "Previous definition only stated a 'new Color 14 block to appear at (4,8)' and didn't mention the disappearance of the old one, which is crucial. Also, specifying 'top-left section of the bottom boundary' for the Color 14 appearance adds clarity based on evidence."
