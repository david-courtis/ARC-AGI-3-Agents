ACTION1: ACTION1 moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit upwards. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) to disappear and a new Color 14 block to appear at (4,8), at the top-left section of the bottom boundary.
  Reason: Previous definition only stated a 'new Color 14 block to appear at (4,8)' and didn't mention the disappearance of the old one, which is crucial. Also, specifying 'top-left section of the bottom boundary' for the Color 14 appearance adds clarity based on evidence.
