  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 had 'NO EFFECT' in the previous state. Since no movement actions are verified, we cannot use a setup sequence to move to a new position. Therefore, we should test a new, untried action to gather new information. ACTION2 (Move DOWN) is chosen as it's the next unobserved movement action, and testing basic movement is a high priority early in exploration.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover if ACTION2 triggers movement or any other effect. This helps to start building knowledge about basic environmental interactions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state is effectively a 'start' state. There is no specific feature that makes it good or bad for testing movement, as we don't know the game boundaries or interactable elements yet."
