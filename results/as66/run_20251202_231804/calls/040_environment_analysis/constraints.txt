- The blue border (Color 12) prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.
- The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) prevents downward movement.
- The thin cyan border (Color 9) further restricts movement outside the main blue boundary.
- The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), and (4,8)) will restrict downward movement into those specific areas, effectively acting as a temporary floor or obstacle depending on their position.
- ACTION5 had NO EFFECT because the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by the 'Black Recess' (Color 0) when attempting to move into or adjacent to its space. This confirms the 'Black Recess' as an impassable obstacle for the direction of ACTION5.
- The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space and blocking ACTION5.
- ACTION2 had NO EFFECT, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint for downward movement at its current position. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be an interaction with green blobs, or a temporary non-visual constraint).
