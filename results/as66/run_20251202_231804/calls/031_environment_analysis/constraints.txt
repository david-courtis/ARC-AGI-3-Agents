- The blue border (Color 12) prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.
- The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents downward movement.
- The thin cyan border (Color 9) further restricts movement outside the main blue boundary.
- The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), and (4,8)) will restrict downward movement into those specific areas, effectively acting as a temporary floor or obstacle depending on their position.
- The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space and blocking ACTION5.
- ACTION2 had NO EFFECT, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint for downward movement at its current position.
