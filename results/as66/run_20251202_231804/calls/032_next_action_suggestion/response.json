  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has not been fully verified (0/3 consistent observations) and has not had a no-effect attempt recently. The 'Moving Block' (Color 8) is positioned in a way that allows upward movement according to the image, and a verified setup sequence is not necessary to try and confirm its upward movement behavior. This is a good opportunity to gather more data for ACTION1.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm ACTION1's behavior of moving the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit upwards. We also hope to observe if there are any additional dynamic UI changes or interactions with the 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) that will provide a second consistent observation for this action. Specifically, we'll confirm its movement and the behavior of the Color 14 block.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'Moving Block' (Color 8) is located at (20,40) and there is ample space above it for upward movement. The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) is below and to the left of the 'Moving Block', so it should not interfere with ACTION1. All actions that had recent no-effects (ACTION2 and ACTION5) are not being chosen, and the current state is suitable for testing upward movement."
