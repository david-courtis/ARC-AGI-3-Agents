Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit upwards. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) to disappear and a new Color 14 block to appear at (4,8), at the top-left section of the bottom boundary.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Moves an active Color 8 object downwards. This action also triggers dynamic UI changes: the appearance of a Color 13 block in the top UI, the appearance of a new Color 14 block at the bottom as a potential new floor/constraint, and a color change at (4,8).
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit to the left. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) block to disappear and a new 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) block to appear at (8,4).
  ACTION4: 2/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit to the right. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) block to disappear and a new 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) block to appear at (8,56).
  ACTION5: VERIFIED - None

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Multiple (Color 12 (blue), Color 9 (cyan), Color 10 (pink), Color 3 (green), Color 4 (yellow)))
  Description: A thick blue border (Color 12) frames the central playing area on the top, left, and right sides. Outside the blue border, there's another thin cyan border (Color 9) on the left, top, and right. Below the main play area, there are fixed lines of pink (Color 10), green (Color 3), and yellow (Color 4) which form a lower UI/boundary structure. A thin pink border (Color 10) and a thin green border (Color 3) are visible at the very top. The bottom boundary dynamically shows Color 14 blocks.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  A central rectangular play area enclosed by distinct static and dynamic borders. There's a clear static top UI area, a robust static multi-layered UI/boundary structure below the main play area, and a highly dynamic 'fill' or 'floor' element (Color 14) that responds to actions within the play area.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed the existence and function of the primary blue boundaries (Color 12) surrounding the play area.
  - Identified a clear top UI region (row 0) where 'move counter' elements appear.
  - Identified a robust bottom UI/boundary structure composed of pink (Color 10), green (Color 3), and yellow (Color 4) lines.
  - Discovery of a new object (Color 13 rectangular block) appearing in the top UI confirms the presence of dynamic UI elements, possibly a move counter or status indicator, which is affected by successful actions.
  - Discovery of a second new object (Color 14 rectangular block) at the very bottom of the screen, which suggests a new boundary or a 'fill' mechanic at the bottom of the play area.
  - Identified a specific dynamic element at (4,8) (a single pixel that changed from Color 14 to Color 12), suggesting either a dynamic boundary corner or another type of counter/status indicator tied to specific locations.
  - Established with high confidence that the orange block (Color 8) is an active, player-controlled, or game-controlled object due to its movement via ACTION2.
  - Confirmed that ACTION3 specifically causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move left and triggers changes in the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14), causing it to disappear from its previous location (56,8) and reappear at a new location (8,4). This suggests a mechanic where ACTION3 (left movement) is linked to 'filling' from the left at the bottom, or clearing/replacing the bottom 'fill' based on player actions.
  - The 'New Bottom Bar' (Color 14) is not static but rather a dynamic element. Its previous instance at (56,8) disappeared and a new larger instance appeared at (8,4) indicating a dynamic 'fill' or 'floor' mechanic that is affected by player actions and can change its position/size.
  - Confirmed that ACTION4 causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move one unit to the right.
  - Confirmation that the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) is a highly dynamic element, as ACTION4 caused its previous instance at (8,4) to disappear and a new instance to appear at (8,56). This further reinforces its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that is responsive to player actions and can occupy different horizontal segments of the bottom boundary.
  - Confirmed that ACTION5 is unable to move the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) in its current state, indicating a new, unknown constraint for this action or direction of movement. This implies either a new type of boundary, an interaction with the green blobs (Color 3), or the black recess (Color 0), or a directional movement not yet defined for ACTION5.
  - Identified the 'Black Recess' (Color 0) as a new, static object within the play area, likely serving as an obstacle or a specific interaction point.
  - Confirmed ACTION1 causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move one unit upwards.
  - Clarified behavior of the 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14): after ACTION1, it appears at (4,8) (a section near the top-left of the bottom boundary), confirming its dynamic nature and responsiveness to vertical movement of the 'Moving Block'.
  - Confirmation that the static 'Black Recess' (Color 0) is a direct impediment for movement, as ACTION5, when attempting to move into its space (or directly next to it), resulted in no effect. This significantly solidifies its role as an unpassable obstacle.
  - Confirmed that the 'Black Recess' (Color 0) is a direct impediment for movement for ACTION5, solidifying its role as an unpassable obstacle in a specific direction.
  - Confirmed that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked from moving downward by ACTION2. This indicates a new, currently unknown, constraint to downward movement beyond the previously identified floor elements. It could be an ephemeral obstacle, a specific interaction with another object, or simply its current position preventing further downward travel.
  - The 'Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill' (Color 14) now consistently appears as a 4x48 block at (8,56) after ACTION4, confirming its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that shifts its horizontal position based on the specific action taken. This further establishes its dynamic nature as a movable floor piece rather than a continuous fill, suggesting distinct segments are activated by different actions.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - The blue border (Color 12) likely prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.
  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents downward movement.
  - The thin cyan border (Color 9) further restricts movement outside the main blue boundary.
  - The newly appeared bottom bar (Color 14) at (56,8) will likely restrict any further downward movement of objects into that area.
  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents immediate downward movement.
  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (either at (56,8) or (8,4)) will restrict downward movement into those areas, effectively acting as a new floor or obstacle depending on their position.
  - The blue border (Color 12) prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.
  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) prevents downward movement.
  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8) or (8,4) or (8,56)) will restrict downward movement into those areas, effectively acting as a new floor or obstacle depending on their position.
  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) prevents immediate downward movement into its area.
  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8), (8,4), or (8,56)) will restrict downward movement into those specific areas, effectively acting as a temporary floor or obstacle depending on their position.
  - ACTION5 had NO EFFECT, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint to perform this action.
  - The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) likely acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space.
  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), and (4,8)) will restrict downward movement into those specific areas, effectively acting as a temporary floor or obstacle depending on their position.
  - The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space.
  - ACTION5 had NO EFFECT, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint for that specific action in that direction. This strongly suggests a boundary or obstacle in the intended direction of ACTION5.
  - ACTION5 had NO EFFECT because the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by the 'Black Recess' (Color 0) when attempting to move into or adjacent to its space. This confirms the 'Black Recess' as an impassable obstacle for the direction of ACTION5.
  - ACTION2 had NO EFFECT, indicating that the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) was blocked by an unknown constraint for downward movement at its current position.
  - The 'Black Recess' (Color 0) acts as a static internal obstacle, preventing movement through its space and blocking ACTION5.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Black Recess (Color 0)

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red) Large rectangle (Role hypothesis: The main game area where actions take place.)
      Evidence: It is the most prevalent color in the central region where dynamic objects move and change.
  - Moving Block: Color 8 (orange) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled or actively game-controlled object.)
      Evidence: Consistently moves in response to ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4, and is the focal point of interaction.
  - Obstacle/Target (Green Blobs): Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs/clusters (Role hypothesis: Obstacles, targets, or collectible items.)
      Evidence: They are static parts of the main play area, but their interaction with the Moving Block (Color 8) is yet to be fully determined.
  - Move Counter/Status Indicator (Top UI): Color 13 (pink) Thin rectangle/line (Role hypothesis: Move counter or turn indicator.)
      Evidence: Appeared in response to a successful action (ACTION2 in a past frame), suggesting it tracks game state or remaining moves.
  - Static Bottom Boundary (Pink): Color 10 (pink) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role hypothesis: Fixed bottom boundary or a UI element.)
      Evidence: It remains static and is positioned at the bottom of the screen, acting as a fixed border.
  - External UI Element (Green Line): Color 3 (green) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Possible score indicator or game state display.)
      Evidence: Located below the main play area and is static, suggesting a UI role.
  - External UI Element (Yellow Line): Color 4 (yellow) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Possible score indicator or game state display.)
      Evidence: Located at the very bottom, static, suggesting a UI role.
  - Dynamic Bottom Bar/Fill: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Temporary floor or 'fill' mechanic indicating progress, current game state, or remaining moves.)
      Evidence: It dynamically appears, disappears, and changes position (e.g., (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), (4,8)) in response to player actions, always at the bottom of the play area, acting as a new floor for downward movement. Its appearance at (8,56) after ACTION4 reinforces its dynamic nature tied to either specific actions or the horizontal position of the moving block.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What specific condition or object is now blocking the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) from moving downwards via ACTION2?
  - What is the exact function of the Color 13 block that appeared in the top UI? Can it decrease or disappear?
  - What is the precise trigger and behavior logic for the Color 14 blocks? Does it 'fill' the bottom, or does it represent collected items or progress? What determines its horizontal position (e.g., (56,8), (8,4), (8,56), (4,8)) after an action?
  - What is the complete pattern of movement for the Color 14 block? Does it always disappear from one location and appear at another specific location after certain actions, or is there a progressive 'filling' mechanic?
  - What is the purpose of the color change at (4,8) from Color 14 to Color 12 observed in an earlier step? Is it tied to successful moves, a timer, or proximity to another object?
  - Do the green 'blobs' (Color 3) act as obstacles, targets, or are they collectible items? How do they interact with the 'Moving Block' (Color 8)?
  - What is the maximum number of times ACTION2, ACTION3, or ACTION4 can be performed before the game state changes drastically or ends?
  - Do the bottommost UI elements (Color 3 green, Color 4 yellow) indicate score, progress, or remaining turns?

Recent Observations:
  - The 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) continues its dynamic behavior, disappearing from one location (8,56) and appearing at another (4,8) after a successful vertical movement (upward in this case), suggesting a 'filling' from the top-left bottom boundary. This further supports the hypothesis of a progressive 'fill' mechanic tied to all movement actions, not just horizontal.
  - Confirmed that ACTION5 is context-dependent and does not always produce an effect.
  - The lack of effect further suggests ACTION5 might be an 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' action that requires specific conditions (e.g., an adjacent target or a particular state) to produce a visible change.
  - ACTION5's function as 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE' is becoming more clear. It seems to require a specific target or proximity to an interactable object to produce an effect. When no such conditions are met, it has no effect.
  - Confirmed that the 'Black Recess' (Color 0) acts as an obstacle to the downward movement (ACTION2) of the 'Moving Block' (Color 8).
