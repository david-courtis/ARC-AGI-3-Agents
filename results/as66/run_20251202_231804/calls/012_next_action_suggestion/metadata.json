  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves an active Color 8 object downwards. This action also triggers dynamic UI changes: the appearance of a Color 13 block in the top UI, the appearance of a new Color 14 block at the bottom as a potential new floor/constraint, and a color change at (4,8).\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit to the left. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) block to disappear and a new 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) block to appear at (8,4).\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) one unit to the right. This action also causes the previous 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) block to disappear and a new 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) block to appear at (8,56).\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple)\n  Description: A thick blue border (Color 12) frames the central playing area on the top, left, and right sides. The bottom border is a thick pink line (Color 10), and below that is a green line (Color 3), then a yellow line (Color 4). Outside the blue border, there's another thin cyan border (Color 9) on the left, top, and right. The bottom boundary dynamically changes with new Color 14 blocks appearing.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A central rectangular play area enclosed by distinct colored borders. There's a clear UI area above and below the main play area. The bottom boundary appears to be highly dynamic, potentially filling from the bottom up.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the existence and function of the primary blue boundaries (Color 12) surrounding the play area.\n  - Identified a clear top UI region (row 0) where 'move counter' elements appear.\n  - Identified a robust bottom UI/boundary structure composed of pink (Color 10), green (Color 3), and yellow (Color 4) lines.\n  - Discovery of a new object (Color 13 rectangular block) appearing in the top UI confirms the presence of dynamic UI elements, possibly a move counter or status indicator, which is affected by successful actions.\n  - Discovery of a second new object (Color 14 rectangular block) at the very bottom of the screen, which suggests a new boundary or a 'fill' mechanic at the bottom of the play area.\n  - Identified a specific dynamic element at (4,8) (a single pixel that changed from Color 14 to Color 12), suggesting either a dynamic boundary corner or another type of counter/status indicator tied to specific locations.\n  - Established with high confidence that the orange block (Color 8) is an active, player-controlled, or game-controlled object due to its movement via ACTION2.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION3 specifically causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move left and triggers changes in the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14), causing it to disappear from its previous location (56,8) and reappear at a new location (8,4). This suggests a mechanic where ACTION3 (left movement) is linked to 'filling' from the left at the bottom, or clearing/replacing the bottom 'fill' based on player actions.\n  - The 'New Bottom Bar' (Color 14) is not static but rather a dynamic element. Its previous instance at (56,8) disappeared and a new larger instance appeared at (8,4) indicating a dynamic 'fill' or 'floor' mechanic that is affected by player actions and can change its position/size.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION4 causes the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to move one unit to the right.\n  - Confirmation that the 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill' (Color 14) is a highly dynamic element, as ACTION4 caused its previous instance at (8,4) to disappear and a new instance to appear at (8,56). This further reinforces its role as a programmatic 'fill' or 'floor' that is responsive to player actions and can occupy different horizontal segments of the bottom boundary.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The blue border (Color 12) likely prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.\n  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents downward movement.\n  - The thin cyan border (Color 9) further restricts movement outside the main blue boundary.\n  - The newly appeared bottom bar (Color 14) at (56,8) will likely restrict any further downward movement of objects into that area.\n  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents immediate downward movement.\n  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (either at (56,8) or (8,4)) will restrict downward movement into those areas, effectively acting as a new floor or obstacle depending on their position.\n  - The blue border (Color 12) prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.\n  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) prevents downward movement.\n  - The dynamically appearing Color 14 blocks at the bottom (e.g., at (56,8) or (8,4) or (8,56)) will restrict downward movement into those areas, effectively acting as a new floor or obstacle depending on their position.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area: Color 6 (red) Large rectangle (Role hypothesis: The main game area where actions take place.)\n      Evidence: Entities move within this area, and it fills the majority of the screen, enclosed by boundaries.\n  - Moving Block: Color 8 (orange) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player or controllable object.)\n      Evidence: Observed to move in response to ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4.\n  - Obstacle/Target: Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs/clusters (Role hypothesis: Obstacles, targets, or collectible items.)\n      Evidence: Their presence and irregular shapes suggest they are interactive elements within the play area, but their exact function is not yet clear.\n  - Move Counter/Status Indicator: Color 13 (pink) Thin rectangle/line (Role hypothesis: Move counter or turn indicator.)\n      Evidence: Appears in the top UI region and changes in response to successful actions (ACTION2). Its position and appearance suggest a quantitative purpose for the player.\n  - Bottom Boundary Marker (Pink): Color 10 (pink) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role hypothesis: Bottom boundary marker or a different UI element.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present at the bottom of the main play area, preventing downward movement of objects.\n  - External UI Element (Green Line): Color 3 (green) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Possible score indicator or game state display.)\n      Evidence: Part of a layered UI structure below the main play area, separate from gameplay.\n  - External UI Element (Yellow Line): Color 4 (yellow) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Possible score indicator or game state display.)\n      Evidence: Part of a layered UI structure below the main play area, separate from gameplay.\n  - Dynamic Bottom Boundary/Fill: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Environmental condition, new game phase indicator, or a 'fill' mechanic from the bottom.)\n      Evidence: Appears and disappears, changing position and size in response to actions (ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4). It directly affects the bottom play area by occupying space, suggesting it acts as a dynamic floor or obstacle that can change the playable height.\n  - Static Corner Marker: Color 12 (blue) Small square (1x1) (Role hypothesis: Boundary marker for the play area or a static UI element.)\n      Evidence: A single pixel at (4,8) that changes color, indicating a dynamic interaction point at the boundary.\n  - Cyan Outer Boundary: Color 9 (cyan) Thin line (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary, purely visual or for hard game limits.)\n      Evidence: Surrounds the entire play area and main blue border, acting as a final barrier.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact function of the Color 13 block that appeared in the top UI? Is it a single-use counter or part of a larger system?\n  - What is the precise trigger and behavior logic for the Color 14 blocks. Does it 'fill' the bottom, or does it represent collected items or progress? Specifically, what determines its horizontal position (e.g., (56,8), (8,4), (8,56)) after an action?\n  - What is the complete pattern of movement for the Color 14 block? Does it always disappear from one location and appear at another specific location after certain actions, or is there a progressive 'filling' mechanic?\n  - What is the purpose of the color change at (4,8) from Color 14 to Color 12? Is it tied to successful moves, a timer, or proximity to another object (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS)?\n  - Do the green 'blobs' (Color 3) act as obstacles, targets, or are they collectible items?\n  - Are there any other internal obstacles or specific movement rules besides the borders?\n  - What is the maximum number of times ACTION2, ACTION3, or ACTION4 can be performed before the game state changes drastically or ends?\n  - Do the bottommost UI elements (Color 3 green, Color 4 yellow) indicate score, progress, or remaining turns?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Moving Block: Color 8 (orange) Rectangular block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - New Bottom Bar: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The appearance of 'Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)' suggests a new type of dynamic boundary or environmental element, possibly related to filling the left side.\n  - The UI elements in the top (Color 13) and bottom region are consistently being affected by successful actions, reinforcing the idea of a move counter / progress bar.\n  - The semantic hint was correct that this action moves left.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION4 moves the 'Moving Block' (Color 8) to the right.\n  - The 'Dynamic Bottom Boundary Fill' (Color 14) continues its dynamic behavior, disappearing from one location (8,4) and appearing at another (8,56) after a successful horizontal movement (rightward in this case), suggesting a 'filling' from the bottom right side. This further supports the hypothesis of a progressive 'fill' mechanic tied to horizontal movement actions.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
