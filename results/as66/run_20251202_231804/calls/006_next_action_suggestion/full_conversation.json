Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)\n2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)\n3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration.

This action also triggers dynamic UI changes: the appearance of a Color 13 block in the top UI, the appearance of a new Color 14 block at the bottom as a potential new floor/constraint, and a color change at (4,8).\n  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nRECENT ACTION HISTORY (last 10 actions taken):\n  1. ACTION1: \u2717 NO EFFECT - The action ACTION1 was taken, but no visible changes occurre...\n  2. ACTION2: \u2713 EFFECT - The action ACTION2 caused a color 8 rectangular block to mov...\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n\u26a0\ufe0f NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 12 (blue))\n  Description: A thick blue border (Color 12) frames the central playing area on the top, left, and right sides. The bottom border is a thick pink line (Color 10), and below that is a green line (Color 3), then a yellow line (Color 4). Outside the blue border, there's another thin cyan border (Color 9) on the left, top, and right.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A central rectangular play area enclosed by distinct colored borders. There's a clear UI area above and below the main play area.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the existence and function of the primary blue boundaries (Color 12) surrounding the play area.\n  - Identified a clear top UI region (row 0) where 'move counter' elements appear.\n  - Identified a robust bottom UI/boundary structure composed of pink (Color 10), green (Color 3), and yellow (Color 4) lines.\n  - Discovery of a new object (Color 13 rectangular block) appearing in the top UI confirms the presence of dynamic UI elements, possibly a move counter or status indicator, which is affected by successful actions.\n  - Discovery of a second new object (Color 14 rectangular block) at the very bottom of the screen, which suggests a new boundary or a 'fill' mechanic at the bottom of the play area.\n  - Identified a specific dynamic element at (4,8) (a single pixel that changed from Color 14 to Color 12), suggesting either a dynamic boundary corner or another type of counter/status indicator tied to specific locations.\n  - Established with high confidence that the orange block (Color 8) is an active, player-controlled, or game-controlled object due to its movement via ACTION2.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The blue border (Color 12) likely prevents movement up, left, and right within the main play area.\n  - The pink bottom boundary (Color 10) likely prevents downward movement.\n  - The thin cyan border (Color 9) further restricts movement outside the main blue boundary.\n  - The newly appeared bottom bar (Color 14) at (56,8) will likely restrict any further downward movement of objects into that area.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area: Color 6 (red) Large rectangle (Role hypothesis: The main game area where actions take place.)\n      Evidence: Entities move within this red space. It's enclosed by borders.\n  - Moving Block: Color 8 (orange) Rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Player or controllable object.)\n      Evidence: ACTION2 caused it to move downwards. It is the only object whose position changed directly due to an action, indicating it's controllable, or part of a controllable entity.\n  - Obstacle/Target 1: Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs/clusters (Role hypothesis: Obstacles, targets, or collectible items.)\n      Evidence: They are static within the play area and their role is not yet clear. They might interact with the moving block.\n  - Internal UI element (top-center): Color 13 (pink) Thin rectangle/line (Role hypothesis: Move counter or turn indicator.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (0,25) in the top UI area. Change in the UI area and its appearance aligns with the theory of a move counter being affected by ACTION2's success.\n  - Internal UI element (bottom): Color 10 (pink) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role hypothesis: Bottom boundary marker or a different UI element.)\n      Evidence: Part of the bounding structure, distinct from the blue walls. Its color is different, suggesting a different function than the main walls.\n  - External UI Element (bottommost): Color 3 (green) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Possible score indicator or game state display.)\n      Evidence: It lies outside the primary play area and its boundaries. Below the pink line, followed by yellow.\n  - External UI Element (bottommost secondary): Color 4 (yellow) Thin horizontal line (Role hypothesis: Possible score indicator or game state display.)\n      Evidence: It lies outside the primary play area and its boundaries, below the green line.\n  - Corner Marker: Color 14 (dark blue) Small square (1x1) (Role hypothesis: Boundary marker for the play area or a static UI element.)\n      Evidence: Changed from 14 to 12. Positioned in the corner of the play area. This color change could indicate a status change after an action, perhaps related to the move counter on top, or just a visual effect.\n  - New Bottom Bar: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Environmental condition or a new game phase indicator.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (56,8). Its large size suggests it's not a counter but perhaps a new obstacle or a visual indicator of progress or remaining space at the bottom of the screen. Its position at the very bottom suggests it may constrain further downward movement after a series of successful moves or be part of a 'fill' mechanic.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact function of the Color 13 block that appeared in the top UI? Is it a single-use counter or part of a larger system?\n  - What is the significance of the Color 14 rectangular block appearing at (56,8)? Is it a permanent new floor, an obstacle, or part of a progress bar?\n  - What is the purpose of the color change at (4,8) from Color 14 to Color 12? Is it tied to successful moves, a timer, or proximity to another object?\n  - Do the green 'blobs' (Color 3) act as obstacles, targets, or are they collectible objects?\n  - Are there any other internal obstacles or specific movement rules besides the borders?\n  - What is the maximum number of times ACTION2 can be performed before the game state changes drastically or ends?\n  - Do the bottommost UI elements (Color 3 green, Color 4 yellow) indicate score, progress, or remaining turns?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'Color 8 rectangular block (4x4)' is likely a key movable object, possibly the 'player'.\n  - Movement appears to be in discrete steps.\n  - Actions can trigger the appearance of new objects and color changes in other objects, possibly related to a 'move counter' system or boundary interaction.\n  - The change in the 'Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8' to 'Color 12' suggests it might be a UI element, or an object that reacts to successful moves.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
