  "reasoning": "ACTION3 (Move LEFT) has no observations yet, so it is a high priority to test. Since ACTION1 had no effect and ACTION2 caused movement, the current state might be good for testing other movement actions. There is clear space to the left of the orange block.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover if ACTION3 causes the orange block to move left, and observe any associated UI or game state changes.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state has the active Color 8 (orange) block in a central-right position, with ample space to its left. This is a good position to test leftward movement. ACTION1 had no effect in the previous state, but ACTION3 is a new action."
