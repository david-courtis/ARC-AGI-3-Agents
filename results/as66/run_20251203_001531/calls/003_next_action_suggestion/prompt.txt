Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the primary controllable entity upwards (decreasing its row/y coordinate). This action is nullified if the entity's path is obstructed by a solid object.
  ACTION2: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
Legacy Objects:
  - 56x52 shape at row 8, col 4: Involved in ACTION1 action
  - 48x4 block at row 4, col 8: Involved in ACTION1 action

Recent Observations:
  - It is hypothesized that the large red-brown square ('56x52 shape at row 8, col 4') is the primary controllable object, rather than any of the smaller shapes within it.
  - The horizontal pink bar ('48x4 block at row 4, col 8') appears to be a solid, immovable obstacle that blocks upward movement.
  - The smaller shapes contained within the red-brown square (e.g., the black 'U' shape, green splotches) may be part of the larger controllable block and move along with it, rather than being independent entities.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5
