1. Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.
2. Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.

4. The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.
