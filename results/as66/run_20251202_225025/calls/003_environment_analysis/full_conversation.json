BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n- Understanding these indicators is crucial - they tell you how many moves remain before failure\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay."

However, in this specific instance, no movement was observed, possibly due to a boundary, an obstruction, or the absence of a 'movable' active object.\"\n  ACTION2: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION3: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n   - These often appear at edges of the screen (top/bottom/sides)\n   - They change when successful moves are made\n   - Running out of moves causes game failure and reset!\n\nIf a movement action had NO EFFECT, the most likely reason is a WALL or BOUNDARY.\nLook carefully at the edges and any patterns that might indicate walls.\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf you have new questions to investigate, list them.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE in the new understanding\n\nDo NOT suggest updates for:\n- Minor refinements or rewording\n- Adding detail that doesn't change the core meaning\n- Speculation without strong evidence\n\nIf you DO suggest an update, keep it SIMPLE and CONCEPTUAL, e.g.:\n- \"moves player up, blocked by Color 0 walls\"\n- \"moves right within bounded play area\"\n- \"interacts with adjacent objects\"\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
