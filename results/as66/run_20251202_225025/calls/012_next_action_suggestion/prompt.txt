Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player_like_object (black U-shape) upwards, likely blocked by the top blue border or green_terrain_or_obstacles.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player_like_object (black U-shape) one unit downwards. It also causes the orange_object (small square) to move one unit downwards. This action triggers a UI change, where a 'move counter' at the top disappears and reappears at the bottom, indicating a successful action.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit to the LEFT. It also causes the 'orange_object' to move. The 'move counter' UI element changes its state from a color 14 block at the bottom to a color 12 at the bottom, and a new color 13 block at the top, and a new color 14 block on the left (likely indicating the axis of movement or a new type of counter).
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, the 'orange_object' might move left instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element.
  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))
  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.
  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.
  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).
  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.
  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)
  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches (Role: Obstacles or terrain features)
  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What are the roles of the various colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area?
  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way?
  - Is the orange square a collectible that disappears upon contact, or a fixed goal?
  - What are the specific movement rules and constraints within the red background area, particularly regarding the green patches?
  - Is the black U-shaped object definitely the player? Could it be a static marker or another object type?

Legacy Objects:
  - player_like_object (Color 0 black U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - orange_object (Color 8 orange small square): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8 (disappeared) / row 56, col 8 (appeared): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (move counter, bottom): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 13 rectangular block (UI element, top): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element, left border): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - player_like_object: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - orange_object: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 12 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - The 'orange_object' seems to move independently or in a pattern not directly tied to the player's intended direction, as it moved left when ACTION4 (move RIGHT) was issued and the player object did not move.
  - The color 14 rectangular blocks act as a UI element, likely indicating a move or turn counter, changing position from left to right in response to an action.
  - The 'orange_object' doesn't necessarily follow the intended direction of the action. Instead, it seems to move in the opposite direction when the 'player_like_object' is blocked.
  - The color 14 rectangular block as a UI element seems to move around the perimeter of the play area in a clockwise fashion to indicate a move was consumed (from bottom to right border in this case).
  - The color 12 rectangular blocks on the sides also act as UI elements and appear to be related to the 'move counter' mechanism. One disappeared from the left and another appeared on the right.
