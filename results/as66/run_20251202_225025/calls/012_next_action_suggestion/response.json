  "target_action": "ACTION5",

  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been observed and is the highest priority for testing. The current position is as good as any other to initially test an interaction action, as we do not yet know its context requirements. ACTION1 recently had no effect, so it cannot be retested in the current state without a setup sequence. Other actions (ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) have had multiple attempts or have shown complex, partially understood behaviors, making the completely unknown ACTION5 the most valuable to test at this moment for maximum information gain.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the basic effect of ACTION5. Does it affect the player, the orange object, or the green obstacles? Does it trigger any UI changes? Is there a context requirement for it to have an effect?",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player_like_object is near the bottom-center of the playing field, surrounded by red background, with green obstacles scattered above and to the right, and the orange_object at the upper right. The current position provides some initial space around the player to observe potential direct effects of ACTION5, without being immediately against a wall or obstacle."
