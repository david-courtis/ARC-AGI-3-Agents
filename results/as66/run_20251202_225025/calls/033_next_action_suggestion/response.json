  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has the fewest attempts (2/8) among the pending actions and therefore needs more observation to be verified. The 'player_like_object' is in a position where moving left (ACTION3) should at least result in the 'movable_marker' moving, as it has done in previous attempts. This attempt will help us get closer to the 3 consistent observations needed for verification. No setup sequence is immediately necessary as the player_like_object is already in a state that should allow for successful observation of ACTION3's effects, given its historical behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validation of ACTION3's behavior, specifically the movement of the 'movable_marker' and the UI elements, when the 'player_like_object' is blocked or otherwise stationary. This will contribute to the 3 consistent observations needed for verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is located towards the left-center of the red background, adjacent to the green terrain on its left and the 'gray_marker' (Color 11) to its upper-right. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 blocks) are in their starting positions. The 'player_like_object' is not against any border to its left, meaning ACTION3 for the 'player_like_object' itself is possible, or at least the 'movable_marker' should move left, which is a consistent past observation."
