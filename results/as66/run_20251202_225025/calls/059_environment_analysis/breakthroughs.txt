1. The 'move_counter_UI_border_indicator' (Color 14 bar) is confirmed to be a UI element that rotates its position around the perimeter of the play area. Its observed change in shape from a vertical bar on the left (48x4) to a horizontal bar on the top (4x48) clearly demonstrates this rotation, confirming its role as a dynamic turn or move indicator.
2. The failure of the 'player_like_object' to move left during ACTION3, while the 'movable_marker' did move left, reinforces that the 'player_like_object' has independent movement constraints from the 'movable_marker'. It was blocked left in its current position.
