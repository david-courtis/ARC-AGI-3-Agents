The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a vertical bar on the left disappeared, and a new 'Color 14 rectangular block' appeared as a vertical bar on the right. The color 12 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a blue vertical bar on the left border, now appears as a new light-pink vertical bar on the right border.

  "new_definition": "ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, a 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will consistently move right instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element which cycles its position around the outer borders of the play area (top, right, bottom, left). The color 12 rectangular UI element, forming the side borders, also changes color and position dynamically, often mirroring the status of the color 14 block or indicating a consumed move, with a consistent pattern of change to light-pink on the new current side and blue on the previous side.",

The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked by any obstacles to its right and was able to move one unit right. The UI elements updated their positions and colors to reflect a registered action.",
