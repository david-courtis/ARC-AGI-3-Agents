  "reasoning": "ACTION3 (move left) has the fewest attempts (3/8) among all pending actions, making it a high priority for further testing. Although ACTION3 previously resulted in no movement for the 'player_like_object', that was in a different state. In the current state, the 'player_like_object' is on the far left of the main play area, adjacent to the blue border. Testing ACTION3 again from this position will help confirm if the blue border is an impassable obstacle to the left or if there's a specific interaction with it. Critically, because it did not have a 'no effect' result in the current position, there is no need for a setup sequence.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to learn: 1. If the blue border entirely blocks leftward movement for the 'player_like_object'. 2. The behavior of the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) and 'gray_marker' (Color 12) when the 'player_like_object' is blocked to the left. 3. Further validate the UI changes (Color 14 and 12 blocks) associated with ACTION3.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in the lower-left quadrant, at position (32,20), adjacent to the blue border on its left. The 'movable_marker' is at (40, 52) and the 'gray_marker' is at (40, 56), both near the bottom right. There is green terrain in various places, including right and above the 'player_like_object', and a smaller piece near the 'gray_marker'. The 'horizontal_pink_strip' is at the very bottom. The location of the 'player_like_object' is conducive to testing leftward movement against the border."
