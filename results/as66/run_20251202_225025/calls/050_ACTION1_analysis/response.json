  "interpretation": "The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' remained stationary. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moved one unit downwards. A Color 12 'gray_marker' also appeared at position (52,48), replacing or moving a previously existing one. The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a horizontal bar at the top was replaced by a new Color 14 block, also at the top, but seemingly at a different position or with slightly different dimensions. There were changes to the color 12 UI elements on the borders, with the right border changing from blue to light-pink and the left border changing from light-pink to blue.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION1 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) upwards by one unit. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also attempts to move the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) upwards by one unit. However, if the 'movable_marker' is blocked from moving up by a green terrain feature, it moves one unit downwards instead. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) seems to move in the same direction as the 'movable_marker' or can also appear at a dynamically determined position. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (left -> top -> right -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars) also seem to rotate on the side borders and change color: when the Color 14 bar is at the top, the left side Color 12 bar is blue and the right side is light-pink, and vice-versa when the Color 14 bar is at the bottom (left light-pink, right blue).",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) was blocked from moving upward by a green terrain feature (the 12x16 shape at 20,32) or the blue border. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was also blocked from moving upward by the green terrain or the blue border (4x4 block at 40,44 is below player, and 8x8 shape is at 44,44). This blocking caused the 'movable_marker' to move downwards instead. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",
