  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not reached 3 consistent observations, making it a priority. While it had a no-effect attempt recently for the player_like_object, the movable_marker did move. However, its definition in the knowledge status includes a contradictory observation (one unit down vs one unit right for movable_marker, and different UI element movements) that needs clarification. The 'player_like_object' remained stationary but the 'movable_marker' moved, which means the state is not exactly the same as the 'no effect' state and it's important to retest the behavior of the movable_marker and UI elements in this context. There is also a possibility that the 'movable_marker' and 'gray_marker' interactions are consistent, but the UI is not. Retesting ACTION2 will help clarify the definition, especially regarding the 'movable_marker's' movement and the UI elements' behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to clarify the movement of the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) and the 'gray_marker' (Color 12) under ACTION2. We also aim to get a more consistent understanding of how the UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) react to this action, specifically whether the Color 14 block moves to the right border or the bottom border, and how the Color 12 bars change. This will help verify ACTION2's full definition.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in a position where it is blocked on almost all sides by either borders or green terrain. However, the 'movable_marker' and 'gray_marker' are present in the top-right quarter of the board, allowing for observation of their movement (if any) with ACTION2. The last two attempts of ACTION2 caused the 'player_like_object' to remain stationary, but the 'movable_marker' moved. This implies that testing it again from this position is not 'repeating the same action in the same state' if we focus on the movable_marker's behavior."
