  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been verified and the 'player_like_object' is currently not blocked to the right by the blue border. Although previous attempts with ACTION4 did not move the 'player_like_object', moving it left in this state has potential to see if it's blocked by the green terrain or the gray_marker. We cannot test actions that had 'no-effect' in the current state until the player is moved. ACTION2 and ACTION5 had recent 'no-effect' attempts, thus they need a setup sequence first. ACTION1 (move up) likewise has been tried many times and yielded no player movement in this 'blocked' position. We have one consistent observation for ACTION3, but it was to the left and confirmed the 'player_like_object' was blocked. ACTION4 has 0/3 consistent observations. Testing ACTION4 in the current position, where the player is to the left of the green terrain and gray marker, is a good way to see if it can move right or if it's consistently blocked.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to observe if ACTION4 successfully moves the 'player_like_object' to the right. If it does not move, we can confirm that the 'player_like_object' is blocked to the right by either the green terrain or the 'gray_marker'. We also want to observe the movement of the 'movable_marker' and 'gray_marker' and the UI elements, and try to get another consistent observation for ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in the lower-left quadrant, adjacent to the left blue border, above the 'horizontal_pink_strip', and to the left of some 'green_terrain_or_obstacles' and the 'gray_marker'. It is not currently blocked by the blue border to its right, but may be blocked by the 'green_terrain_or_obstacles' or 'gray_marker'. The 'movable_marker' is also present (lower-right). The state is suitable for testing rightward movement of the 'player_like_object' and 'movable_marker' without predefined blue border blocking."
