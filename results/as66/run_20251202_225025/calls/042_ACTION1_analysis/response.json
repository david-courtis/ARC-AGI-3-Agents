  "new_definition": "ACTION1 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) upwards by one unit. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also moves the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) upwards by one unit, regardless of whether the 'player_like_object' moves. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (left -> top -> right -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars) also seem to rotate on the side borders, changing color depending on the side. When the color 14 bar is on the left, the color 12 bar on the left is blue, and when the color 14 bar is on the right, the color 12 bar on the left is light-pink, and vice-versa for the right side.",

The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked by any obstacles above it and was able to move one unit up. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",
