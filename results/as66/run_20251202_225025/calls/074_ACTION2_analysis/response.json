  "new_definition": "ACTION2 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit downwards. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, other designated objects, such as 'movable_marker' (Color 11) or 'gray_marker' (Color 12), may move. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will attempt to move one unit downwards. The 'movable_marker' might also move horizontally, although this is less consistent. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) also moves downwards if present and not blocked. A successful full or partial move of any designated object (player, movable_marker, gray_marker) triggers a UI change: the color 14 rectangular block (move counter) moves from its current border (top, bottom, left, or right) to the bottom border. The color 12 rectangular block (another UI element) moves from its current border (left or right) to the opposite border and changes color.",

The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked to its left by any obstacles and was able to move one unit left. The UI elements updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",
