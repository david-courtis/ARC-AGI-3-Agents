1. The 'orange_object' (collectible/target) is no longer visible, suggesting it was either collected, moved off-screen, or disappeared after an action. This strengthens the hypothesis of it being a collectible.
2. A new 'gray_marker' (Color 12) appeared within the play area, adjacent to the 'player_like_object'. This could be a new obstacle, an interactable element, or a UI element that appears dynamically in front of the player.
3. A 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) has appeared at the bottom of the main play area, within the blue border. This could be a new UI indicator, a score element, or a boundary that was previously not visible.
