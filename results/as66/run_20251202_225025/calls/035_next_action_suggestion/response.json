  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 needs more validation and has not been attempted from this exact position recently. The 'player_like_object' is positioned such that moving right might allow it to clear the green obstacle and possibly reveal new interactions or movement mechanics. All movement actions are still pending validation. Since ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION5 had no effect recently, and no verified actions exist yet to move the player, the best strategy is to try one of the unvalidated movement actions (ACTION3 or ACTION4) that hasn't recently resulted in a 'no effect'. While ACTION3 also has not had a recent 'no effect', visual inspection suggests ACTION4 might move the player into a more 'open' space compared to ACTION3 which would attempt to move it further into the pink strip and border. Also, the description for ACTION4 mentions the 'movable_marker' moving right if the player is blocked, which we haven't seen in this specific situation yet and could provide valuable insight into the 'movable_marker's' behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if the 'player_like_object' can move right, if it is blocked by the green terrain or borders, or if the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moves right as described in the ACTION4 definition. This will help us validate the behavior of ACTION4 and understand the 'movable_marker's' role and movement rules under blockage by various obstacles.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is currently positioned to the left of some green terrain and to the right of the pink strip. It appears to be somewhat constrained. The 'movable_marker' is currently above and slightly to the right of the 'player_like_object'. The board provides a good opportunity to test rightward movement and observe interactions with both green obstacles and the 'movable_marker'."
