  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not been verified and has had 7 attempts. While the 'player_like_object' remained stationary in previous attempts, the 'movable_marker' and 'gray_marker' have shown movement. The current state allows us to test ACTION2 to see if the 'player_like_object' or either of the markers can move downwards, specifically to observe if the interaction with the 'horizontal_pink_strip' or the blue border has changed. Given that all previous actions in the recent history resulted in the player_like_object remaining stationary, it's critical to vary the action tested. Since no specific movement action for the player_like_object has been verified, we cannot use a setup sequence to move it. We re-test ACTION2 to continue gathering observations on its effect on the 'movable_marker' and 'gray_marker' and against the existing obstacles.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to gain further observations on the movement of the 'movable_marker' and 'gray_marker' with ACTION2, and their interaction with environmental elements. We also want to see if recent changes to the board, like the appearance of new UI elements or movement of existing ones (like the 'movable_marker'), have changed how ACTION2 behaves, particularly if it now causes the player_like_object to move down or affects other objects not observed before. Given the player is currently blocked in many directions, observing subtle changes in the 'movable_marker' and 'gray_marker' is key to understanding this action.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is positioned in the lower-left area of the main play area, surrounded by the blue border, 'green_terrain_or_obstacles', and and the 'horizontal_pink_strip' at the bottom. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is further up and to the right, and the 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is adjacent to a patch of 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'. The 'move_counter_UI_border_indicator' (Color 14) is on the bottom border. The current position of the player and the presence of obstacles suggest that direct movement for the 'player_like_object' will likely continue to be blocked, but testing can reveal secondary effects on other objects (movable_marker, gray_marker) or UI elements."
