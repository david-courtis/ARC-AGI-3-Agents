  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not yet been sufficiently observed to establish its full behavior; it only has 1 recorded attempt, and the last attempt showed the player_like_object remaining stationary. To validate ACTION4 further, we need to test it in a different position. The player_like_object is currently against a green obstacle. Moving it away from the obstacle using ACTION2 (which has moved the player downwards before) will allow us to test the 'move right' action in a clearer space. We'll use ACTION2 thrice to get a significant displacement downwards. This also helps to validate ACTION2 further towards verification, as it has not yet reached 3/3 consistent observations.",
  "expected_information_gain": "This will help us to understand ACTION4's movement properties (moves the player right), especially whether it also affects the orange object and the UI in a similar or different way as ACTION3. We will also learn more about ACTION2's consistency. By moving to a new position, we can see if ACTION4 has a different outcome or if the 'no effect' observation was context-dependent.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player_like_object (black U-shape) is positioned near a green obstacle to its left and above it. The orange_object is above and to the left of the player. The player is not currently at a border that would block rightward movement directly, but its proximity to the green obstacle might affect movement. The current position is not ideal to test ACTION4 without influence from the green obstacles that might block any attempt to move right or for ACTION5 which has not yet been observed. Thus, a setup sequence is crucial."
