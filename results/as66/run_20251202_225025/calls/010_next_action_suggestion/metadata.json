  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player_like_object (black U-shape) upwards, likely blocked by the top blue border or green_terrain_or_obstacles.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player_like_object (black U-shape) one unit downwards. It also causes the orange_object (small square) to move one unit downwards. This action triggers a UI change, where a 'move counter' at the top disappears and reappears at the bottom, indicating a successful action.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit to the LEFT. It also causes the 'orange_object' to move. The 'move counter' UI element changes its state from a color 14 block at the bottom to a color 12 at the bottom, and a new color 13 block at the top, and a new color 14 block on the left (likely indicating the axis of movement or a new type of counter).\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))\n  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.\n  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.\n  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).\n  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.\n  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches (Role: Obstacles or terrain features)\n  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What are the roles of the various colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area?\n  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way?\n  - Is the orange square a collectible that disappears upon contact, or a fixed goal?\n  - What are the specific movement rules and constraints within the red background area, particularly regarding the green patches?\n  - Is the black U-shaped object definitely the player? Could it be a static marker or another object type?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - player_like_object (Color 0 black U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - orange_object (Color 8 orange small square): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8 (disappeared) / row 56, col 8 (appeared): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (move counter, bottom): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (UI element, top): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element, left border): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - player_like_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - orange_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The 'orange_object' also moves with ACTION3, specifically down and left this time, confirming its linkage to player actions or its own movement rules.\n  - The 'move counter' UI mechanism is more complex than a simple appearing/disappearing block. It involves color changes and new blocks appearing in different locations (top, left), possibly indicating different move types or states.\n  - The 'player_like_object' can be blocked by green terrain features or the blue border.\n  - The 'orange_object' seems to move independently or in a pattern not directly tied to the player's intended direction, as it moved left when ACTION4 (move RIGHT) was issued and the player object did not move.\n  - The color 14 rectangular blocks act as a UI element, likely indicating a move or turn counter, changing position from left to right in response to an action.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not yet been sufficiently observed to establish its full behavior; it only has 1 recorded attempt, and the last attempt showed the player_like_object remaining stationary. To validate ACTION4 further, we need to test it in a different position. The player_like_object is currently against a green obstacle. Moving it away from the obstacle using ACTION2 (which has moved the player downwards before) will allow us to test the 'move right' action in a clearer space. We'll use ACTION2 thrice to get a significant displacement downwards. This also helps to validate ACTION2 further towards verification, as it has not yet reached 3/3 consistent observations.",
    "expected_information_gain": "This will help us to understand ACTION4's movement properties (moves the player right), especially whether it also affects the orange object and the UI in a similar or different way as ACTION3. We will also learn more about ACTION2's consistency. By moving to a new position, we can see if ACTION4 has a different outcome or if the 'no effect' observation was context-dependent.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The player_like_object (black U-shape) is positioned near a green obstacle to its left and above it. The orange_object is above and to the left of the player. The player is not currently at a border that would block rightward movement directly, but its proximity to the green obstacle might affect movement. The current position is not ideal to test ACTION4 without influence from the green obstacles that might block any attempt to move right or for ACTION5 which has not yet been observed. Thus, a setup sequence is crucial."
