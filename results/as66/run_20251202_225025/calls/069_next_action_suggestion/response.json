  "reasoning": "ACTION2 is a pending action that needs further validation (0/3 consistent). The 'player_like_object' is currently at 'row 32, col 24'. The previous attempt to use ACTION2 (move down) resulted in no visible movement for the 'player_like_object', likely due to being blocked by the 'horizontal_pink_strip' or the blue border/internal objects. However, the definition for ACTION2 suggests that if the 'player_like_object' is blocked, the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) attempts to move downwards, and potentially also right. In the current state, the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is not visible, but the 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is visible at 'row 52, col 56'. The definition of ACTION2 also states 'If a 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is present and not blocked, it will also move downwards.' This provides a new test condition for ACTION2 focused on the 'gray_marker'.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the movement of the 'gray_marker' (Color 12) downwards and potentially learn more about its interaction with ACTION2 and any potential blocking objects. If the 'gray_marker' moves, it will provide a consistent observation for ACTION2. We can also observe for the presence or movement of the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) if it reappears or becomes unblocked. We will also observe the UI element changes to confirm the consistency of previous observations.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is positioned next to several green obstacles and blocked by the bottom border/pink strip, preventing its direct movement. The 'gray_marker' is visible near the bottom right. The current state is suitable for testing the secondary effects of ACTION2 on the 'gray_marker'."
