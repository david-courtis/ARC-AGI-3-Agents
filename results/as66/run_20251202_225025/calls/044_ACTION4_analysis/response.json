  "interpretation": "The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' remained stationary, as it was blocked from moving right. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moved one unit right. A new 'movable_marker' (Color 11) with dimensions 4x4 appeared at (52, 48), replacing or moving a previously existing one. A color 14 rectangular block (UI element) appeared as a vertical bar on the right. The color 14 bar that was previously a horizontal bar at the top was not directly observed to disappear, but the object that was previously the 'Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8' *changed to color 12*. An additional Color 13 block (16x1) appeared at (0,24). The color 12 vertical bar (UI element) which was previously blue on the left border, now appears to be a separate smaller object with new coordinates (Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) appeared at (0, 24)). This could indicate a change in how the UI elements are rendered or an update in their status. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) appeared at position (52,48).",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, a 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will consistently move right instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element around the borders of the play area in a clockwise direction. The color 12 rectangular UI element, forming the side borders, also changes color and position dynamically, often mirroring the status of the color 14 block or indicating a consumed move.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) was blocked from moving right by a green terrain feature (the 12x8 shape at 40,28 and the 8x8 shape at 44,44) or the blue border. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked by any obstacles to its right and was able to move one unit right. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) updated their positions and colors to reflect a registered action. The 'gray_marker' at (24,44) disappeared and a new one appeared at (52,48), implying it is linked to the movable_marker.",

The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is below and to the right of the U-shape. Green terrain features are present. The color 14 rectangular block as a UI element is a horizontal bar at the top.

    "The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) at (24,44) disappeared and a new 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (52, 48)' appeared. This suggests that the 'gray_marker' *is* the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) and it also moved, or there are multiple types.",
    "The Color 14 rectangular block that was previously a horizontal bar at the top (4,8) changed its color to 12. This indicates a different behavior for the specific 'top' position of the Color 14 UI element or a specific color sequence for the UI elements.",
    "A new 'Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24)' appeared, previously classified as 'horizontal_pink_strip'. This might be another UI element or an indicator."
