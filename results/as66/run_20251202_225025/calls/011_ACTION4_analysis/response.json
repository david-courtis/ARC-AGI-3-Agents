The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) previously at the bottom disappeared, and a new color 14 rectangular block appeared on the right border. The larger color 12 UI elements on the sides also changed, with the one on the left disappearing and a new one appearing on the right, but the analysis focuses on the color 14 block due to the previous observations regarding its 'move counter' role.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, the 'orange_object' might move left instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element.",

    "The color 12 rectangular blocks on the sides also act as UI elements and appear to be related to the 'move counter' mechanism. One disappeared from the left and another appeared on the right."
