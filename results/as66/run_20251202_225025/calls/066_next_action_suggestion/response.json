  "target_action": "ACTION4",

  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been verified yet and it's an important movement action. While it had no effect recently, the 'player_like_object' appears to be in a position where it might be able to move right. There's open space to its right before hitting any green terrain or the border, which presents a good opportunity to test if it can move or if another object moves instead. Since the player_like_object is not against a wall to the right, we do not need a setup sequence. All previous attempts of ACTION4 had the 'player_like_object' being stationary, so moving it right would be a significant breakthrough.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe whether ACTION4 moves the 'player_like_object' to the right, verify its interaction with the 'movable_marker' if the 'player_like_object' is blocked, and confirm the UI element changes for this action.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is currently positioned such that there appears to be clear space to its right within the red background, before encountering any green terrain or the blue border. This seems to be a suitable state to test ACTION4 without needing a setup sequence to unblock the 'player_like_object' first. Other actions such as ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 seem to be blocked by the surrounding internal and external borders, and green terrains."
