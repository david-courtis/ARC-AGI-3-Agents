  "reasoning": "ACTION2 and ACTION5 recently had no effect, so we should not test them in the current state without first performing a setup sequence. All movement actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) are unverified. ACTION1 and ACTION3 were attempted recently. ACTION4 has been attempted 6 times but is still unverified. Given the current position of the 'player_like_object' is near green terrain and the left border, attempting to move right (ACTION4) provides a good opportunity to observe if it can move over the red background, if it is blocked by obstacles, or if it interacts with the newly appeared 'gray_marker' to its right. We've seen that the 'movable_marker' reliably moves right when the 'player_like_object' is blocked, this test will provide more data for both. Additionally, it will generate more data for the UI elements which already change with every action. Since the 'player_like_object' is not against the right border, `ACTION4` has a good chance of showing a successful move.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe whether the 'player_like_object' can move right over the red background or if it's blocked by the green terrain or the 'gray_marker'. We also want to observe the interaction, if any, with the 'gray_marker'. Further validation of how the 'movable_marker' behaves when the 'player_like_object' is blocked for ACTION4, and more data on the UI elements.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is positioned in the lower-left quadrant of the screen, adjacent to green terrain above and to its right, the left border, and the 'gray_marker' to its immediate right. The 'movable_marker' is currently below the 'player_like_object'. The 'horizontal_pink_strip' is at the bottom. This state is conducive to testing rightward movement as the 'player_like_object' is not against the right border."
