The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a horizontal bar at the top disappeared, and a new color 14 rectangular block appeared as a vertical bar on the left.

  "new_definition": "ACTION3 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit to the LEFT. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, its movement is prevented. A 'movable_marker' (Color 11) also moves one unit to the LEFT, if not blocked. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, its movement is prevented. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 rectangular blocks) change their positions and/or colors upon action, with the Color 14 block cycling its position among the borders (currently from top to left), and the Color 12 block (border UI element) changing its color (from blue to light-pink) when on the left border. Other Color 12 UI elements may also appear at new locations or change due to this action.",

The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked by any obstacles to its left and was able to move one unit left. The UI elements updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",
