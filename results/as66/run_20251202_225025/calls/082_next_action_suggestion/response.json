  "reasoning": "All actions have had their player_like_object component blocked in the current positions. We need to move the player_like_object to an unblocked position before retesting any action, especially ACTION3 and ACTION5 which are pending. Although no actions have been verified, ACTION1 and ACTION4 seem to have some effect on the movable_marker and other UI elements, making them the best candidates to use for a 'setup sequence' that is likely to change the state. By attempting to move up and right, there's a higher chance of freeing the player_like_object or simply altering the game state enough to get new observations on ACTION3.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the 'player_like_object' moving due to the setup sequence, or at least a significant change in the 'movable_marker' or UI elements. After the setup, testing ACTION3 again from a new position should yield new information about its effects on the 'player_like_object' and other objects, ideally unblocking movement. We're also hoping to gather more consistent observations to verify ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4 for future setup sequences.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) is currently blocked in all directions by either the blue border, green terrain, or the newly appeared horizontal pink strip. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is adjacent to the 'player_like_object'. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is outside the typical game area and has moved due to recent actions. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) are active and reacting to actions. The critical issue is the 'player_like_object' is stuck, meaning all previous actions had 'no effect' on it. We must prioritize moving it for further learning."
