  "new_definition": "ACTION2 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit downwards. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) attempts to move downwards. If the 'movable_marker' is present and not blocked, it will move one unit down AND CAN ALSO MOVE RIGHT SIMULTANEOUSLY. If a 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is present and not blocked, it will also move downwards. A successful full or partial move of any designated object (player, movable_marker, gray_marker) triggers a UI change: the color 14 rectangular block (move counter) moves from its current border (top, bottom, left, or right) to the bottom border, and the color 12 rectangular block (another UI element) moves from its current border (left or right) to the opposite border. These UI changes indicate a successful action attempt, regardless of which object actually moved or if any object moved at all.",

The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked by any obstacles below it and was able to move one unit down and one unit right. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",
