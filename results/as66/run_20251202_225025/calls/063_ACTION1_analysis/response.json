The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a vertical bar on the right disappeared, and a new 'Color 14 rectangular block' appeared as a horizontal bar at the top. The color 12 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a blue vertical bar on the left border, now appears to be a light-pink vertical bar on the left border. The color 12 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a light-pink vertical bar on the right border, now appears to be a blue vertical bar on the right border.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) was blocked from moving upward by a green terrain feature (the 12x16 shape at 20,32) or the blue border. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked from moving up by any obstacles below it and was able to move one unit up. However, the pixel analysis shows the movable_marker moved left in the current observation. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",

    "Observation [3] states 'MOVED: 1 objects ~ Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (52, 48) moved left'. This contradicts the semantic hint of 'Move UP' for ACTION1 and suggests the 'movable_marker' can move differently to the player or has a more complex movement rule, or ACTION1 does not exclusively mean 'Move UP'."
