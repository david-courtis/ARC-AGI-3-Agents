Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:
"ACTION1 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) upwards by one unit. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also attempts to move the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) upwards by one unit. If the 'movable_marker' is blocked from moving up by a green terrain feature, it moves one unit downwards instead; otherwise, if not blocked from moving up, it moves one unit up. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) seems to move in the same direction as the 'movable_marker'. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position counter-clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (right -> top -> left -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars on left/right border) also follow a rotational pattern, changing color (blue/light-pink) and position (left/right) based on the position of the Color 14 bar, with the light-pink bar appearing opposite to the direction the Color 14 bar is moving from."

  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' is in the lower-middle of the play area. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) and 'gray_marker' (Color 12) are above some green terrain and to the right of the player_like_object. Green terrain features are present. The color 14 rectangular block as a UI element is a horizontal bar at the top instead of a vertical bar on one of the sides. The color 12 rectangular block (UI element) forms the left border (light-pink) and a blue vertical bar continues to form the right border.
      Interpretation: The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' remained stationary. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moved one unit downwards. A new color 14 rectangular block appeared as a horizontal bar at the top, and the previous color 14 block at the bottom disappeared. Another color 11 rectangular block (movable_marker) also appeared at a different location (40,44), while an earlier one at (8,44) disappeared, indicating a movement for the 'movable_marker' or a new instance. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) also moved one unit downwards.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' is in the lower-middle of the play area, blocked from moving right. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is below and to the right of the U-shape. Green terrain features are present. The color 14 rectangular block as a UI element is a horizontal bar at the top, possibly moved during the action.
      Interpretation: The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' remained stationary. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moved one unit downwards. A Color 12 'gray_marker' also appeared at position (52,48), replacing or moving a previously existing one. The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a horizontal bar at the top was replaced by a new Color 14 block, also at the top, but seemingly at a different position or with slightly different dimensions. There were changes to the color 12 UI elements on the borders, with the right border changing from blue to light-pink and the left border changing from light-pink to blue.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' is in the lower-middle of the play area, blocked from moving right. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is below and to the right of the U-shape. Green terrain features are present. The color 14 rectangular block as a UI element is a vertical bar on the right. The color 12 rectangular block (UI element) forms the left border (blue).
      Interpretation: The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' remained stationary. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moved one unit left. The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a vertical bar on the right disappeared, and a new 'Color 14 rectangular block' appeared as a horizontal bar at the top. The color 12 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a blue vertical bar on the left border, now appears to be a light-pink vertical bar on the left border. The color 12 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a light-pink vertical bar on the right border, now appears to be a blue vertical bar on the right border.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))
  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.
  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.
  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).
  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.
  - The failure of ACTION5, with no visible changes to any identified object, suggests that either the 'player_like_object' was blocked by an environmental element (orange_object, green_terrain_or_obstacles, or the blue border), or ACTION5 is an action that only has an effect under specific conditions, or it is a 'no-op' action in this state.
  - The 'orange_object' (collectible/target) is no longer visible, suggesting it was either collected, moved off-screen, or disappeared after an action. This strengthens the hypothesis of it being a collectible.
  - A new 'gray_marker' (Color 12) appeared within the play area, adjacent to the 'player_like_object'. This could be a new obstacle, an interactable element, or a UI element that appears dynamically in front of the player.
  - A 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) has appeared at the bottom of the main play area, within the blue border. This could be a new UI indicator, a score element, or a boundary that was previously not visible.
  - The failure of ACTION2 confirms that downward movement is blocked for the 'player_like_object' in its current position. This could be due to the blue border at the bottom, the newly appeared 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'.
  - Confirmed that the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is an independently movable object that can move even if the 'player_like_object' does not.
  - The 'player_like_object' remaining stationary while the 'movable_marker' moved implies that ACTION5's effect on the 'player_like_object' can be conditional or it has a secondary effect on other objects if the primary target is blocked.
  - The 'move_counter_UI_border_indicator' (Color 14 bar) is confirmed to be a UI element that rotates its position around the perimeter of the play area. Its observed change in shape from a vertical bar on the left (48x4) to a horizontal bar on the top (4x48) clearly demonstrates this rotation, confirming its role as a dynamic turn or move indicator.
  - The failure of the 'player_like_object' to move left during ACTION3, while the 'movable_marker' did move left, reinforces that the 'player_like_object' has independent movement constraints from the 'movable_marker'. It was blocked left in its current position.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.
  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.
  - Movement was not affected by ACTION5, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state.
  - ACTION5 had no effect, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state. The 'player_like_object' is adjacent to green patches and a new gray object on its right, and the blue border on its left. This suggests strong blocking in multiple directions.
  - ACTION2 (move down) had no visible effect. Given the player_like_object is near the bottom of the play area and above the 'horizontal_pink_strip', it is likely blocked by either the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal green obstacles.
  - The 'player_like_object' remained stationary during ACTION3, even though the 'movable_marker' moved. This confirms that the 'player_like_object' was blocked to the left in its current position, likely by the blue border or an internal obstacle not explicitly identified as 'green terrain'.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - green_terrain_or_obstacles

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)
  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches of pixels (Role: Obstacles or terrain features that block movement)
  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)
  - gray_marker: Color 12 (gray) Small square (1x1) (Role: Movement tracker/Progress indicator or an interactable object.)
  - horizontal_pink_strip: Color 13 (light-pink) Thin horizontal strip at the bottom of the blue border (Role: UI Element / Boundary element)
  - movable_marker: Color 11 Rectangular block (Role: Secondary player/collectible/dynamic obstacle/indicator)
  - move_counter_UI_border_indicator: Color 14 Rectangular block (Role: UI Element: Move/Turn counter)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What are the roles of the various layered colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area, especially the yellow border at the bottom and pink border at the top?
  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way when the 'player_like_object' is adjacent or within them?
  - What caused the 'orange_object' to disappear? Was it collected by the 'player_like_object', or did it move off-screen due to ACTION5, or something else?
  - What is the specific role of the 'gray_marker'? Is it an obstacle, a trigger, or a dynamic UI element within the play area itself?
  - What is the exact boundary or obstacle that blocked ACTION2 (move down) for the 'player_like_object'? Is it the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'?
  - Does the movement of the 'movable_marker' have any spatial constraints or interactions with other objects or boundaries?
  - What is the function of the Color 12 UI elements on the left and right border, how does their color change (blue/light-pink) relate to gameplay or actions?

Recent Observations:
  - The Color 14 UI element rotates its position counter-clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (right -> top -> left -> bottom, etc.).
  - The Color 12 UI elements on the left/right border also follow a rotational pattern, changing color (blue/light-pink) and position based on the position of the Color 14 bar, with the light-pink bar appearing opposite to the direction the Color 14 bar is moving from. When Color 14 moves to the top, the left Color 12 bar becomes light-pink, and the right Color 12 bar becomes blue.
  - The Color 14 UI element moves from the top border to the left border upon ACTION3, reinforcing the cyclical pattern around the perimeter.
  - The Color 12 UI element on the left border changes from blue to light-pink when the Color 14 UI element moves to the left border, confirming its role in indicating action state and its coupled behavior with Color 14.
  - The Color 12 UI elements on the perimeter appear to alternate between blue and light-pink. The blue color signifies the 'previous' side of the Color 14 UI element, while light-pink signifies the 'current' side.
