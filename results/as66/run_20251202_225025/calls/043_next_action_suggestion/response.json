  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been verified and has a very inconsistent definition, indicating that its effect is highly context-dependent. It has not been attempted recently (not in the last two attempts as a 'no-effect' action, like ACTION2 and ACTION5). Although the 'player_like_object' remained stationary in its last three attempts, the 'movable_marker' is consistently moving. We need to understand the conditions under which the 'player_like_object' moves. Since the 'movable_marker' successfully moved right in these attempts, it indicates that rightward movement is generally possible for some object in the current state. This makes it a good candidate to re-test the behavior of the 'player_like_object' versus the 'movable_marker' without a setup sequence, as there is still information to be gained from this specific state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further clarify the conditions under which ACTION4 moves the 'player_like_object' versus the 'movable_marker'. Observe if any other new objects appear or existing objects disappear during this action. Additionally, we want to observe the UI elements (Color 12 and Color 14) and their interaction with the movement of either object.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in a corner (bottom-left area) surrounded by the blue border, terrain, and the newly appeared 'gray_marker'. Upward and downward movements are currently blocked. Rightward movement is possible for the 'movable_marker'. This state is good for observing ACTION4's effects, especially regarding the preferential movement between the 'player_like_object' and the 'movable_marker' when the 'player_like_object' might be blocked."
