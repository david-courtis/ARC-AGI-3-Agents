{
  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has no observations yet, making it a high priority for testing. Since ACTION1 had no effect and ACTION2 moved the player, the player_like_object is in a different position than when ACTION1 was attempted. Therefore, we don't need a setup sequence to try a new action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the effect of moving left (ACTION3) on the player_like_object and potentially other objects (like the orange_object) and the UI/move counter. This will help understand horizontal movement mechanics and potential interactions with the green terrain or borders.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player_like_object is currently at a position that has not been tested with leftward movement. There is green terrain to the left, which might interact with the movement. The orange object is above and to the right, so it's unlikely to be immediately impacted unless its movement is tied to the player's in a more complex way."
