  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has had no effect in recent attempts and the 'player_like_object' is currently blocked in all cardinal directions. To test ACTION1 meaningfully, we need to move the 'player_like_object' to a new position where it is not immediately against a boundary or obstacle in the upward direction. ACTION4 (move right) is the most likely candidate for movement, as the 'player_like_object' is on the far left. Since ACTION4 has also consistently failed to move the 'player_like_object', but its definition suggests it moves the 'movable_marker' if the player is blocked, using it in a setup sequence is a way to change the state. Moving right twice should get the player_like_object away from the left border and the green terrain, potentially allowing for upward movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the 'player_like_object' to a new position using ACTION4, we can attempt to unblock ACTION1. This will allow us to observe if ACTION1 eventually moves the 'player_like_object' or if its effect is solely on the 'movable_marker' or other UI elements, under different conditions. We also continue to gather more data points for ACTION4, even if it's currently only moving the 'movable_marker'.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in the lower-left quadrant, surrounded by the blue border to its left and bottom, and green terrain above and to its right. The 'gray_marker' is still in the bottom-right. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11, which is not directly visible but described as moving with other actions) and other UI elements are in specific configurations. The crucial aspect is that the 'player_like_object' is currently blocked from moving in all directions, as indicated by recent 'no effect' actions."
