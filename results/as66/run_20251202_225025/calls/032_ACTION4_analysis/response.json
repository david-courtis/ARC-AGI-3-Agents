If the player object is blocked, a 'movable_marker' (Color 11, previously sometimes identified as 'gray_marker' or Color 12 due to misidentification) will move right instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement and/or color change of a color 14 rectangular UI element and a color 12 rectangular UI element, which appear to cycle their positions clockwise and counter-clockwise respectively around the play area borders based on the direction of the action.",
