  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had a 'NO EFFECT' recently, so it cannot be tested in the current state. We need to move the 'player_like_object' to a new position. Given that ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4 all involve movement of 'movable_marker' or 'gray_marker' and UI elements, we can use a combination of these to move the player to a different location within the play area, away from potential blocking objects. Specifically, moving up and right repeatedly should allow us to position the 'player_like_object' in an area less likely to be immediately blocked. The current position of the 'player_like_object' directly next to green terrain, a gray marker, and borders makes testing ACTION5 difficult. Moving it up and right will get it to a new location. We will use a sequence of ACTION1 (up), ACTION4 (right), and ACTION1 (up). Although ACTION1 definition currently reports movement of an orange object and not the player, the actual observation from recent history is 'black U-shaped object remained stationary', which means its intended movement was for the black U-shape. Also, based on previous definitions, ACTION1 moves the player upwards. ACTION4 moves the player right. Using a sequence of these will allow us to reposition the player effectively and then retest ACTION5.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 in a new position, we hope to understand its actual effect. Does it interact with specific objects? Does it modify the 'player_like_object' itself? By using a setup sequence involving movement, we can confirm the movement capabilities and constraints of the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) and the 'movable_marker' more thoroughly, even though they still need full verification. This also tests for context-dependence of ACTION5.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in the bottom-left area, surrounded by the blue border, green terrain, and a gray marker. This position has proven to be restrictive for actions ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION5. The 'movable_marker' is currently above and to the right of the 'player_like_object'. The board has a visible 'horizontal_pink_strip' at the bottom of the main play area as well as a 'gray_marker' near the center-right. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) are also present. The current state is not ideal for retesting an action that had 'NO EFFECT' previously, especially ACTION5, as the 'player_like_object' is currently adjacent to multiple potential blocking objects and borders hindering any interaction or movement actions."
