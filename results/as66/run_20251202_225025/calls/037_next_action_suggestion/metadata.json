  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) upwards by one unit. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also moves an 'orange_object' upwards by one unit, regardless of whether the 'player_like_object' moves. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (left -> top -> right -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars) also seem to rotate on the side borders inversely to the color 14 block.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit downwards. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) attempts to move downwards. A successful full or partial move of either object triggers a UI change: the color 14 rectangular block (move counter) moves from its current border (top, bottom, left, or right) to the bottom border, and the color 12 rectangular block (another UI element) moves from its current border (left or right) to the opposite border. These UI changes indicate a successful action attempt, regardless of which object actually moved or if any object moved at all.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit to the LEFT. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, its movement is prevented. A 'movable_marker' (Color 11) also moves one unit to the LEFT, if not blocked. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 rectangular blocks) change their positions and/or colors upon action, with the Color 14 block cycling its position among the borders, and the Color 12 block (border UI element) changing its color and position (likely cycling between opposing borders and changing color in sync with the other UI Element changes), indicating a move attempt was made.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, a 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will consistently move right instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the persistent movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element around the borders of the play area in a clockwise direction, and the color 12 rectangular UI element which appears to reflect the color 14 status on opposite borders.\n  ACTION5: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))\n  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.\n  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.\n  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).\n  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.\n  - The failure of ACTION5, with no visible changes to any identified object, suggests that either the 'player_like_object' was blocked by an environmental element (orange_object, green_terrain_or_obstacles, or the blue border), or ACTION5 is an action that only has an effect under specific conditions, or it is a 'no-op' action in this state.\n  - The 'orange_object' (collectible/target) is no longer visible, suggesting it was either collected, moved off-screen, or disappeared after an action. This strengthens the hypothesis of it being a collectible.\n  - A new 'gray_marker' (Color 12) appeared within the play area, adjacent to the 'player_like_object'. This could be a new obstacle, an interactable element, or a UI element that appears dynamically in front of the player.\n  - A 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) has appeared at the bottom of the main play area, within the blue border. This could be a new UI indicator, a score element, or a boundary that was previously not visible.\n  - The failure of ACTION2 confirms that downward movement is blocked for the 'player_like_object' in its current position. This could be due to the blue border at the bottom, the newly appeared 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.\n  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.\n  - Movement was not affected by ACTION5, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state. The 'player_like_object' is adjacent to green patches and a new gray object on its right, and the blue border on its left. This suggests strong blocking in multiple directions.\n  - ACTION2 (move down) had no visible effect. Given the player_like_object is near the bottom of the play area and above the 'horizontal_pink_strip', it is likely blocked by either the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal green obstacles.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches of pixels (Role: Obstacles or terrain features that block movement)\n  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)\n  - gray_marker: Color 12 (gray) Small square (1x1) (Role: Movement tracker/Progress indicator or an interactable object.)\n  - horizontal_pink_strip: Color 13 (light-pink) Thin horizontal strip at the bottom of the blue border (Role: UI Element / Boundary element)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What are the roles of the various layered colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area, especially the new pink stripe?\n  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way when the 'player_like_object' is adjacent or within them?\n  - What caused the 'orange_object' to disappear? Was it collected by the 'player_like_object', or did it move off-screen due to ACTION5, or something else?\n  - What is the specific role of the newly appeared 'gray_marker'? Is it an obstacle, a trigger, or a dynamic UI element within the play area itself?\n  - What specific condition(s) might prevent ACTION5 from having a visible effect? Was the 'player_like_object' blocked by any of the existing objects, the new gray marker, or the new pink strip?\n  - What is the exact boundary or obstacle that blocked ACTION2 (move down) for the 'player_like_object'? Is it the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - player_like_object (Color 0 black U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - orange_object (Color 8 orange small square): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8 (disappeared) / row 56, col 8 (appeared): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (move counter, bottom): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (UI element, top): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element, left border): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - player_like_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - orange_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - gray_marker: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - movable_marker: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 vertical bars (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - blue border: Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (UI element) consistently moves to the opposite vertical border when an action is taken and the Color 14 block moves to the bottom border.\n  - The 'movable_marker' is consistently Color 11 (previously identified as Gray/Color 12). This clarifies its identity.\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (UI element) changes its position in relation to the action, mirroring the Color 14 block's movement.\n  - The Color 12 UI elements (borders) appear to change color in addition to position following an action.\n  - The color 12 UI border on the left appears to toggle between blue and light-pink. When color 14 bar is on the left, color 12 bar is blue. When color 14 bar is on the right, color 12 bar on the left is light-pink.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.\n  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.\n  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).\n  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.\n  - The failure of ACTION5, with no visible changes to any identified object, suggests that either the 'player_like_object' was blocked by an environmental element (orange_object, green_terrain_or_obstacles, or the blue border), or ACTION5 is an action that only has an effect under specific conditions, or it is a 'no-op' action in this state.\n  - The 'orange_object' (collectible/target) is no longer visible, suggesting it was either collected, moved off-screen, or disappeared after an action. This strengthens the hypothesis of it being a collectible.\n  - A new 'gray_marker' (Color 12) appeared within the play area, adjacent to the 'player_like_object'. This could be a new obstacle, an interactable element, or a UI element that appears dynamically in front of the player.\n  - A 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) has appeared at the bottom of the main play area, within the blue border. This could be a new UI indicator, a score element, or a boundary that was previously not visible.\n  - The failure of ACTION2 confirms that downward movement is blocked for the 'player_like_object' in its current position. This could be due to the blue border at the bottom, the newly appeared 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.\n  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.\n  - Movement was not affected by ACTION5, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state. The 'player_like_object' is adjacent to green patches and a new gray object on its right, and the blue border on its left. This suggests strong blocking in multiple directions.\n  - ACTION2 (move down) had no visible effect. Given the player_like_object is near the bottom of the play area and above the 'horizontal_pink_strip', it is likely blocked by either the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal green obstacles.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches of pixels (Role: Obstacles or terrain features that block movement)\n  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)\n  - gray_marker: Color 12 (gray) Small square (1x1) (Role: Movement tracker/Progress indicator or an interactable object.)\n  - horizontal_pink_strip: Color 13 (light-pink) Thin horizontal strip at the bottom of the blue border (Role: UI Element / Boundary element)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What are the roles of the various layered colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area, especially the new pink stripe?\n  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way when the 'player_like_object' is adjacent or within them?\n  - What caused the 'orange_object' to disappear? Was it collected by the 'player_like_object', or did it move off-screen due to ACTION5, or something else?\n  - What is the specific role of the newly appeared 'gray_marker'? Is it an obstacle, a trigger, or a dynamic UI element within the play area itself?\n  - What specific condition(s) might prevent ACTION5 from having a visible effect? Was the 'player_like_object' blocked by any of the existing objects, the new gray marker, or the new pink strip?\n  - What is the exact boundary or obstacle that blocked ACTION2 (move down) for the 'player_like_object'? Is it the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - player_like_object (Color 0 black U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - orange_object (Color 8 orange small square): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8 (disappeared) / row 56, col 8 (appeared): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (move counter, bottom): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (UI element, top): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element, left border): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - player_like_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - orange_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - gray_marker: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - movable_marker: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 vertical bars (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - blue border: Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (UI element) consistently moves to the opposite vertical border when an action is taken and the Color 14 block moves to the bottom border.\n  - The 'movable_marker' is consistently Color 11 (previously identified as Gray/Color 12). This clarifies its identity.\n  - The Color 12 rectangular block (UI element) changes its position in relation to the action, mirroring the Color 14 block's movement.\n  - The Color 12 UI elements (borders) appear to change color in addition to position following an action.\n  - The color 12 UI border on the left appears to toggle between blue and light-pink. When color 14 bar is on the left, color 12 bar is blue. When color 14 bar is on the right, color 12 bar on the left is light-pink.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION2: 1 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION5: 2 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had a 'NO EFFECT' recently, so it cannot be tested in the current state. We need to move the 'player_like_object' to a new position. Given that ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4 all involve movement of 'movable_marker' or 'gray_marker' and UI elements, we can use a combination of these to move the player to a different location within the play area, away from potential blocking objects. Specifically, moving up and right repeatedly should allow us to position the 'player_like_object' in an area less likely to be immediately blocked. The current position of the 'player_like_object' directly next to green terrain, a gray marker, and borders makes testing ACTION5 difficult. Moving it up and right will get it to a new location. We will use a sequence of ACTION1 (up), ACTION4 (right), and ACTION1 (up). Although ACTION1 definition currently reports movement of an orange object and not the player, the actual observation from recent history is 'black U-shaped object remained stationary', which means its intended movement was for the black U-shape. Also, based on previous definitions, ACTION1 moves the player upwards. ACTION4 moves the player right. Using a sequence of these will allow us to reposition the player effectively and then retest ACTION5.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION5 in a new position, we hope to understand its actual effect. Does it interact with specific objects? Does it modify the 'player_like_object' itself? By using a setup sequence involving movement, we can confirm the movement capabilities and constraints of the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) and the 'movable_marker' more thoroughly, even though they still need full verification. This also tests for context-dependence of ACTION5.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in the bottom-left area, surrounded by the blue border, green terrain, and a gray marker. This position has proven to be restrictive for actions ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION5. The 'movable_marker' is currently above and to the right of the 'player_like_object'. The board has a visible 'horizontal_pink_strip' at the bottom of the main play area as well as a 'gray_marker' near the center-right. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) are also present. The current state is not ideal for retesting an action that had 'NO EFFECT' previously, especially ACTION5, as the 'player_like_object' is currently adjacent to multiple potential blocking objects and borders hindering any interaction or movement actions."
