If the player object is blocked, a 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will consistently move right instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the persistent movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element around the borders of the play area in a clockwise direction, and the color 12 rectangular UI element which appears to reflect the color 14 status on opposite borders.",
