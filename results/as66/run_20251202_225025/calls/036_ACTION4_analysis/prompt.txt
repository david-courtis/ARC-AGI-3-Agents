Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, a 'movable_marker' (Color 11, previously sometimes identified as 'gray_marker' or Color 12 due to misidentification) will move right instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement and/or color change of a color 14 rectangular UI element and a color 12 rectangular UI element, which appear to cycle their positions clockwise and counter-clockwise respectively around the play area borders based on the direction of the action."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (4 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' is in the lower-middle of the play area. The orange 'movable_object' is to the upper-middle right. Green terrain features are present. The color 14 rectangular block (move counter) is at the bottom, and a color 12 rectangular block forms the right border.
      Interpretation: The black U-shaped object remained stationary. The orange square moved one unit left. The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) previously at the bottom disappeared, and a new color 14 rectangular block appeared on the right border. The larger color 12 UI elements on the sides also changed, with the one on the left disappearing and a new one appearing on the right, but the analysis focuses on the color 14 block due to the previous observations regarding its 'move counter' role.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' is in the lower-middle of the play area. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is to the right of the player_like_object. Green terrain features are present. The color 14 rectangular block as a UI element is at the bottom. A color 12 rectangular block (UI element) forms the right border.
      Interpretation: The black U-shaped object remained stationary. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) moved one unit right. The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) at the bottom disappeared, and a new color 14 rectangular block appeared as a vertical bar on the right. The color 12 vertical bar on the right border disappeared, and a new one appeared on the left border.
  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' is in the lower-middle of the play area. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is below and to the right of the U-shape. Green terrain features are present. The color 14 rectangular block as a UI element is a horizontal bar at the bottom. A color 12 rectangular block (UI element) forms the right border. The 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) is at the bottom of the main play area.
      Interpretation: The black U-shaped object ('player_like_object') remained stationary. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moved one unit right. The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a horizontal bar at the bottom disappeared, and a new color 14 rectangular block appeared as a vertical bar on the right. The color 12 vertical bars (UI element) on the right border disappeared, and a new one appeared on the left border.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))
  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.
  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.
  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).
  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.
  - The failure of ACTION5, with no visible changes to any identified object, suggests that either the 'player_like_object' was blocked by an environmental element (orange_object, green_terrain_or_obstacles, or the blue border), or ACTION5 is an action that only has an effect under specific conditions, or it is a 'no-op' action in this state.
  - The 'orange_object' (collectible/target) is no longer visible, suggesting it was either collected, moved off-screen, or disappeared after an action. This strengthens the hypothesis of it being a collectible.
  - A new 'gray_marker' (Color 12) appeared within the play area, adjacent to the 'player_like_object'. This could be a new obstacle, an interactable element, or a UI element that appears dynamically in front of the player.
  - A 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) has appeared at the bottom of the main play area, within the blue border. This could be a new UI indicator, a score element, or a boundary that was previously not visible.
  - The failure of ACTION2 confirms that downward movement is blocked for the 'player_like_object' in its current position. This could be due to the blue border at the bottom, the newly appeared 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.
  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.
  - Movement was not affected by ACTION5, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state.
  - ACTION5 had no effect, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state. The 'player_like_object' is adjacent to green patches and a new gray object on its right, and the blue border on its left. This suggests strong blocking in multiple directions.
  - ACTION2 (move down) had no visible effect. Given the player_like_object is near the bottom of the play area and above the 'horizontal_pink_strip', it is likely blocked by either the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal green obstacles.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - green_terrain_or_obstacles

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)
  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches of pixels (Role: Obstacles or terrain features that block movement)
  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)
  - gray_marker: Color 12 (gray) Small square (1x1) (Role: Movement tracker/Progress indicator or an interactable object.)
  - horizontal_pink_strip: Color 13 (light-pink) Thin horizontal strip at the bottom of the blue border (Role: UI Element / Boundary element)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What are the roles of the various layered colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area, especially the new pink stripe?
  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way when the 'player_like_object' is adjacent or within them?
  - What caused the 'orange_object' to disappear? Was it collected by the 'player_like_object', or did it move off-screen due to ACTION5, or something else?
  - What is the specific role of the newly appeared 'gray_marker'? Is it an obstacle, a trigger, or a dynamic UI element within the play area itself?
  - What specific condition(s) might prevent ACTION5 from having a visible effect? Was the 'player_like_object' blocked by any of the existing objects, the new gray marker, or the new pink strip?
  - What is the exact boundary or obstacle that blocked ACTION2 (move down) for the 'player_like_object'? Is it the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'?

Recent Observations:
  - The 'movable_marker' (Color 11, previously 'gray_marker' and sometimes misidentified as Color 12) consistently moves in the direction of the action if the primary 'player_like_object' is blocked.
  - The Color 12 rectangular block (UI element) consistently moves to the opposite vertical border when an action is taken and the Color 14 block moves to the bottom border.
  - The 'movable_marker' is consistently Color 11 (previously identified as Gray/Color 12). This clarifies its identity.
  - The Color 12 rectangular block (UI element) changes its position in relation to the action, mirroring the Color 14 block's movement.
  - The Color 12 UI elements (borders) appear to change color in addition to position following an action.
