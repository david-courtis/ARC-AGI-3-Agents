If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also attempts to move the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) upwards by one unit. If 'movable_marker' is blocked from moving up, it moves down by one unit instead, possibly by overriding due to a different 'down' action that it can also perform. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) seems to move in the same direction as the 'movable_marker'. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (left -> top -> right -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars) also seem to rotate on the side borders, changing color depending on the side. When the color 14 bar is on the left, the color 12 bar on the left is blue, and when the color 14 bar is on the right, the color 12 bar on the left is light-pink, and vice-versa for the right side. The UI elements' color and position changes might be more complex than a simple rotation, possibly indicating action type or state.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit downwards. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) attempts to move downwards. If the 'movable_marker' is present and not blocked, it will move one unit down. If a 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is present and not blocked, it will also move downwards. A successful full or partial move of any designated object (player, movable_marker, gray_marker) triggers a UI change: the color 14 rectangular block (move counter) moves from its current border (top, bottom, left, or right) to the bottom border, and the color 12 rectangular block (another UI element) moves from its current border (left or right) to the opposite border. These UI changes indicate a successful action attempt, regardless of which object actually moved or if any object moved at all.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit to the LEFT. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, its movement is prevented. A 'movable_marker' (Color 11) also moves one unit to the LEFT, if not blocked. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 rectangular blocks) change their positions and/or colors upon action, with the Color 14 block cycling its position among the borders, and the Color 12 block (border UI element) changing its color and position (likely cycling between opposing borders and changing color in sync with the other UI Element changes), indicating a move attempt was made.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 6/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, a 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will consistently move right instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element around the borders of the play area in a clockwise direction. The color 12 rectangular UI element, forming the side borders, also changes color and position dynamically, often mirroring the status of the color 14 block or indicating a consumed move.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' to an unknown direction. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moves up by one unit.\n\nRECENT ACTION HISTORY (last 10 actions taken):\n  1.

ACTION2: \u2713 EFFECT - The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' remained stationary....\n  10. ACTION1: \u2713 EFFECT - The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' remained stationary....\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))\n  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.\n  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.\n  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).\n  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.\n  - The failure of ACTION5, with no visible changes to any identified object, suggests that either the 'player_like_object' was blocked by an environmental element (orange_object, green_terrain_or_obstacles, or the blue border), or ACTION5 is an action that only has an effect under specific conditions, or it is a 'no-op' action in this state.\n  - The 'orange_object' (collectible/target) is no longer visible, suggesting it was either collected, moved off-screen, or disappeared after an action. This strengthens the hypothesis of it being a collectible.\n  - A new 'gray_marker' (Color 12) appeared within the play area, adjacent to the 'player_like_object'. This could be a new obstacle, an interactable element, or a UI element that appears dynamically in front of the player.\n  - A 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) has appeared at the bottom of the main play area, within the blue border. This could be a new UI indicator, a score element, or a boundary that was previously not visible.\n  - The failure of ACTION2 confirms that downward movement is blocked for the 'player_like_object' in its current position. This could be due to the blue border at the bottom, the newly appeared 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'.\n  - Confirmed that the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is an independently movable object that can move even if the 'player_like_object' does not.\n  - The 'player_like_object' remaining stationary while the 'movable_marker' moved implies that ACTION5's effect on the 'player_like_object' can be conditional or it has a secondary effect on other objects if the primary target is blocked.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.\n  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.\n  - Movement was not affected by ACTION5, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state. The 'player_like_object' is adjacent to green patches and a new gray object on its right, and the blue border on its left. This suggests strong blocking in multiple directions.\n  - ACTION2 (move down) had no visible effect. Given the player_like_object is near the bottom of the play area and above the 'horizontal_pink_strip', it is likely blocked by either the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal green obstacles.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches of pixels (Role: Obstacles or terrain features that block movement)\n  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)\n  - gray_marker: Color 12 (gray) Small square (1x1) (Role: Movement tracker/Progress indicator or an interactable object.)\n  - horizontal_pink_strip: Color 13 (light-pink) Thin horizontal strip at the bottom of the blue border (Role: UI Element / Boundary element)\n  - movable_marker: Color 11 Rectangular block (Role: Secondary player/collectible/dynamic obstacle/indicator)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What are the roles of the various layered colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area, especially the new pink stripe?\n  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way when the 'player_like_object' is adjacent or within them?\n  - What caused the 'orange_object' to disappear? Was it collected by the 'player_like_object', or did it move off-screen due to ACTION5, or something else?\n  - What is the specific role of the newly appeared 'gray_marker'? Is it an obstacle, a trigger, or a dynamic UI element within the play area itself?\n  - What is the exact boundary or obstacle that blocked ACTION2 (move down) for the 'player_like_object'? Is it the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'?\n  - Does the movement of the 'movable_marker' have any spatial constraints or interactions with other objects or boundaries?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - player_like_object (Color 0 black U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - orange_object (Color 8 orange small square): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8 (disappeared) / row 56, col 8 (appeared): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (move counter, bottom): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (UI element, top): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element, left border): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - player_like_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - orange_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - gray_marker: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - movable_marker: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 vertical bars (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - blue border: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 15 background: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - horizontal_pink_strip: Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - A new 'Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24)' appeared, previously classified as 'horizontal_pink_strip'. This might be another UI element or an indicator.\n  - The 48x48 Color 15 background at (row 8, col 8) appears to have either shrunk or been partially covered, as indicated by the changed bounding box and pixels affected, but no specific object changes were detected within it. This could indicate a subtle change in terrain or background elements.\n  - The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is now clearly confirmed to be distinct from 'movable_marker' (Color 11) and also moved one unit down when ACTION2 was taken.\n  - The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) exhibits unexpected behavior when blocked from moving 'up', potentially moving 'down' instead. This implies a more complex movement logic than simple blocking.\n  - The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) seems to consistently move with the 'movable_marker' (Color 11), suggesting a direct association or a mirrored movement.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION2: 1 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION5: 2 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
