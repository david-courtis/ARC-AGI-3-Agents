  "reasoning": "All actions are unverified, and ACTION1 has the most attempts (5/8) but is still unverified. The 'player_like_object' is currently positioned such that ACTION1 previously had no effect. However, the last two observations of ACTION1 (both having no effect on the player) occurred in different situations (ACTION1_7: player at (3,2); ACTION1_10: unknown player pos, but prior actions were ACTION4 then ACTION2 so player moved to (4,2)). Since the current position of the 'player_like_object' is (4,2), and the last time ACTION1 was attempted (ACTION1_10) it was in this very same current game state. Thus, we need to move the player around before retrying ACTION1 to ensure that we are not testing it in a previously known 'no-effect' state. However, none of the movement actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) are verified. This means we cannot use a 'setup_sequence' based on verified actions. Given the constraint that we cannot retry an action with no effect in the same state, and all movement actions are unverified, the best strategy is to pick the unverified action with the highest number of attempts that resulted in no effect. This is ACTION1. It is important to try to get observations where ACTION1 is not blocked. We also want to observe the more complex movement of the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) and 'gray_marker' (Color 12): when 'player_like_object' is blocked, 'movable_marker' moves up, and if 'movable_marker' is blocked from moving up, it moves down. This suggests a complex behavior for ACTION1 and we have very few observations of it.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We want to see if the 'player_like_object' can move successfully with ACTION1. If not, we want to observe the precise movement of the 'movable_marker' and 'gray_marker', particularly if the 'movable_marker' attempts to move up and then moves down if blocked. This will help us clarify the conditional movement rules for ACTION1. This will also help confirm if the previous position (4,2) was truly blocking, or if there's an internal bug in the game that explains the previous no-results.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) is at (4,2), surrounded by green features on its top-right and bottom-right positions. It's next to the blue border on its left. The 'movable_marker' is at (4,7) and the 'gray_marker' is at (5,7). There is an orange block above the movable marker (3,7). All observations on the player's movement in the past have been negative so there is a high chance it will remain stationary here again. However, since the primary objective is to verify all actions, and all movement actions are unverified, we choose ACTION1 for further testing."
