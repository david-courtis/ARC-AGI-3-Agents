This action does not appear to move the 'player_like_object' directly. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) are not consistently updated upon this action, indicating a different trigger mechanism for UI updates with ACTION5, or that it is not considered a 'move'. ACTION5 may also affect the background (Color 15), causing it to shrink, which could be related to 'terrain' changes.",

The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked by any obstacles to its left and was able to move one unit left. The UI elements did not change, suggesting ACTION5 does not always trigger UI updates. The background (Color 15) changed, indicating a potential interaction.",
