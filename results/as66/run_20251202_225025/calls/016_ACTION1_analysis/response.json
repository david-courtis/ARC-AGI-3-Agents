The color 14 rectangular block, which previously was a vertical bar on the left, disappeared and a new color 14 rectangular block appeared as a horizontal bar at the top.

  "new_definition": "ACTION1 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) upwards by one unit. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also moves an 'orange_object' upwards by one unit, regardless of whether the 'player_like_object' moves. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (left -> top -> right -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars) also seem to rotate on the side borders inversely to the color 14 block.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'player_like_object' was blocked from moving upward by green terrain or the blue border, hence it remained stationary. The 'orange_object' was not blocked and was able to move up. The UI 'move counter' elements updated to reflect that an action was attempted.",
