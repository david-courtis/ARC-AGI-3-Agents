  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 needs more validation (0/3 consistent) and has not recently resulted in a 'NO EFFECT' outcome from the current position. While ACTION3 also needs validation and hasn't had a recent 'NO EFFECT', the player_like_object is currently adjacent to the left border. Attempting ACTION3 might immediately lead to a blocked state, providing less new information. Testing ACTION4, moving right, where there is clear space, is more likely to yield a successful movement, providing more data points for its definition. Both ACTION1 and ACTION2 recently had 'NO EFFECT' outcomes, and ACTION5 had two recent 'NO EFFECT' outcomes. Since we don't have any verified actions to move with, and given the critical rule about not testing actions that had no effect in the current state unless we move, the only actions left are ACTION3 and ACTION4. ACTION4 provides a better prospect for movement and new information.",
  "expected_information_gain": "This attempt will help confirm if ACTION4 reliably moves the 'player_like_object' to the right and how it affects the 'orange_object' if it reappears, or if the 'gray_marker' and 'green_terrain' act as obstacles. This will add to the validation count for ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in the bottom-left area of the playfield. It is blocked from moving up by green terrain and blocked from moving down by the new pink strip and likely the blue border. It is adjacent to the blue border on the left and has a 'gray_marker' nearby on the right, as well as some 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'. There appears to be open space to the right, which makes ACTION4 a good candidate for testing a movement action that might not be blocked immediately."
