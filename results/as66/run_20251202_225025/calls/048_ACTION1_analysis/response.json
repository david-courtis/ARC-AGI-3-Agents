  "interpretation": "The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' remained stationary. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moved one unit downwards. A new color 14 rectangular block appeared as a horizontal bar at the top, and the previous color 14 block at the bottom disappeared. Another color 11 rectangular block (movable_marker) also appeared at a different location (40,44), while an earlier one at (8,44) disappeared, indicating a movement for the 'movable_marker' or a new instance. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) also moved one unit downwards.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION1 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) upwards by one unit. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also attempts to move the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) upwards by one unit. If 'movable_marker' is blocked from moving up, it moves down by one unit instead, possibly by overriding due to a different 'down' action that it can also perform. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) seems to move in the same direction as the 'movable_marker'. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (left -> top -> right -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars) also seem to rotate on the side borders, changing color depending on the side. When the color 14 bar is on the left, the color 12 bar on the left is blue, and when the color 14 bar is on the right, the color 12 bar on the left is light-pink, and vice-versa for the right side. The UI elements' color and position changes might be more complex than a simple rotation, possibly indicating action type or state.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) was blocked from moving upward by a green terrain feature (the 12x16 shape at 20,32) or the blue border. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was *also* blocked from moving upward by the green terrain or the blue border, which seemingly caused it to move downwards instead. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12 block) moved downwards, potentially linked to the 'movable_marker's' movement. The UI elements updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",
