  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 8/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) upwards by one unit. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also attempts to move the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) upwards by one unit. If the 'movable_marker' is blocked from moving up by a green terrain feature, it moves one unit downwards instead; otherwise, if not blocked from moving up, it moves one unit up. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) seems to move in the same direction as the 'movable_marker'. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position counter-clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (right -> top -> left -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars on left/right border) also follow a rotational pattern, changing color (blue/light-pink) and position (left/right) based on the position of the Color 14 bar, with the light-pink bar appearing opposite to the direction the Color 14 bar is moving from.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 7/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit downwards. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, other designated objects, such as 'movable_marker' (Color 11) or 'gray_marker' (Color 12), may move. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will attempt to move one unit downwards. The 'movable_marker' might also move horizontally, although this is less consistent. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) also moves downwards if present and not blocked. A successful full or partial move of any designated object (player, movable_marker, gray_marker) triggers a UI change: the color 14 rectangular block (move counter) moves from its current border (top, bottom, left, or right) to the bottom border. The color 12 rectangular block (another UI element) moves from its current border (left or right) to the opposite border and changes color.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit to the LEFT. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, its movement is prevented. A 'movable_marker' (Color 11) also moves one unit to the LEFT, if not blocked. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, its movement is prevented. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 rectangular blocks) change their positions and/or colors upon action, with the Color 14 block cycling its position among the borders (currently from top to left), and the Color 12 block (border UI element) changing its color (from blue to light-pink) when on the left border. Other Color 12 UI elements may also appear at new locations or change due to this action.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 9/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, a 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will consistently move right instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element which cycles its position around the outer borders of the play area (top, right, bottom, left). The color 12 rectangular UI element, forming the side borders, also changes color and position dynamically, often mirroring the status of the color 14 block or indicating a consumed move, with a consistent pattern of changing to light-pink on the new current side and blue on the previous side. The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' is unable to move due to various obstacles, specifically the green terrain features (shapes at 12,12), the 12x16 shape at 20,32, the 12x8 shape at 40,28, and the 8x8 shape at 44,44) or the blue border.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 causes the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) to move one unit upwards if it is not blocked. This action does not appear to move the 'player_like_object' directly. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) are not consistently updated upon this action, indicating a different trigger mechanism for UI updates with ACTION5, or that it is not considered a 'move'.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))\n  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.\n  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.\n  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).\n  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.\n  - The failure of ACTION5, with no visible changes to any identified object, suggests that either the 'player_like_object' was blocked by an environmental element (orange_object, green_terrain_or_obstacles, or the blue border), or ACTION5 is an action that only has an effect under specific conditions, or it is a 'no-op' action in this state.\n  - The 'orange_object' (collectible/target) is no longer visible, suggesting it was either collected, moved off-screen, or disappeared after an action. This strengthens the hypothesis of it being a collectible.\n  - A new 'gray_marker' (Color 12) appeared within the play area, adjacent to the 'player_like_object'. This could be a new obstacle, an interactable element, or a UI element that appears dynamically in front of the player.\n  - A 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) has appeared at the bottom of the main play area, within the blue border. This could be a new UI indicator, a score element, or a boundary that was previously not visible.\n  - The failure of ACTION2 confirms that downward movement is blocked for the 'player_like_object' in its current position. This could be due to the blue border at the bottom, the newly appeared 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'.\n  - Confirmed that the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is an independently movable object that can move even if the 'player_like_object' does not.\n  - The 'player_like_object' remaining stationary while the 'movable_marker' moved implies that ACTION5's effect on the 'player_like_object' can be conditional or it has a secondary effect on other objects if the primary target is blocked.\n  - The 'move_counter_UI_border_indicator' (Color 14 bar) is confirmed to be a UI element that rotates its position around the perimeter of the play area. Its observed change in shape from a vertical bar on the left (48x4) to a horizontal bar on the top (4x48) clearly demonstrates this rotation, confirming its role as a dynamic turn or move indicator.\n  - The failure of the 'player_like_object' to move left during ACTION3, while the 'movable_marker' did move left, reinforces that the 'player_like_object' has independent movement constraints from the 'movable_marker'. It was blocked left in its current position.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.\n  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.\n  - Movement was not affected by ACTION5, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state. The 'player_like_object' is adjacent to green patches and a new gray object on its right, and the blue border on its left. This suggests strong blocking in multiple directions.\n  - ACTION2 (move down) had no visible effect. Given the player_like_object is near the bottom of the play area and above the 'horizontal_pink_strip', it is likely blocked by either the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal green obstacles.\n  - The 'player_like_object' remained stationary during ACTION3, even though the 'movable_marker' moved. This confirms that the 'player_like_object' was blocked to the left in its current position, likely by the blue border or an internal obstacle not explicitly identified as 'green terrain'.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches of pixels (Role: Obstacles or terrain features that block movement)\n  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)\n  - gray_marker: Color 12 (gray) Small square (1x1) (Role: Movement tracker/Progress indicator or an interactable object.)\n  - horizontal_pink_strip: Color 13 (light-pink) Thin horizontal strip at the bottom of the blue border (Role: UI Element / Boundary element)\n  - movable_marker: Color 11 Rectangular block (Role: Secondary player/collectible/dynamic obstacle/indicator)\n  - move_counter_UI_border_indicator: Color 14 Rectangular block (Role: UI Element: Move/Turn counter)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What are the roles of the various layered colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area, especially the yellow border at the bottom and pink border at the top?\n  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way when the 'player_like_object' is adjacent or within them?\n  - What caused the 'orange_object' to disappear? Was it collected by the 'player_like_object', or did it move off-screen due to ACTION5, or something else?\n  - What is the specific role of the 'gray_marker'? Is it an obstacle, a trigger, or a dynamic UI element within the play area itself?\n  - What is the exact boundary or obstacle that blocked ACTION2 (move down) for the 'player_like_object'? Is it the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'?\n  - Does the movement of the 'movable_marker' have any spatial constraints or interactions with other objects or boundaries?\n  - What is the function of the Color 12 UI elements on the left and right border, how does their color change (blue/light-pink) relate to gameplay or actions?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - player_like_object (Color 0 black U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - orange_object (Color 8 orange small square): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8 (disappeared) / row 56, col 8 (appeared): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (move counter, bottom): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (UI element, top): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element, left border): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - player_like_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - orange_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - gray_marker: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - movable_marker: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 vertical bars (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - blue border: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 15 background: Involved in ACTION5 action\n  - horizontal_pink_strip: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - move_counter_UI_border_indicator: Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 14 rectangular block (move counter) consistently moves to the right border in this new observation of ACTION2, which is different from previous observations where it moved to the bottom border. This indicates a more complex or cyclical pattern for the move counter's position.\n  - The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) follow a cyclical pattern of movement and color change around the border, indicating a consumed move. The Color 14 block moves from bottom to right, and the Color 12 blocks cycle through colors and positions on the left and right borders.\n  - The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) appears to move left in this instance of ACTION2, which contradicts the 'Move DOWN' semantic hint and previous observations of downward or diagonal movement for ACTION2.\n  - The color 14 UI element moved from the right border to the bottom border, reinforcing the pattern of it rotating around the edges of the play area upon an action being taken.\n  - The Color 12 UI elements on the left and right border continue to cycle colors and positions upon an action.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no observed effect in the previous state and appears to be conditional. We need to move the 'player_like_object' to a new, less constrained position to re-test it. The previous no-effect attempt for ACTION5 dictates a setup sequence first. ACTION3 (move left) can move the 'player_like_object' away from the green and gray obstacles. If ACTION3 fails, we try other movement. Since we can't observe the 'movable_marker' directly, we'll try to move the 'player_like_object' to a new location. We will attempt a sequence of verified actions (or actions with good progress towards verification) to shift the 'player_like_object' to a different area of the board, trying to get it away from the current cluster of 'green_terrain_or_obstacles' and the 'gray_marker'. We are using ACTION3 and ACTION1 to get off the bottom edge and away from the center, then ACTION4 to move right into a new area. If the 'player_like_object' doesn't move, the UI state will change, and effectively consume a turn, allowing us to re-test ACTION5 in a 'new' state. The overall goal is to get ACTION5 to have an effect so we can verify its behavior.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to definitively observe the effect of ACTION5 on the 'player_like_object' and other game elements when the 'player_like_object' is in a different position. This will allow for further understanding of ACTION5's conditions for effect, especially concerning interactions with obstacles and other game objects. We also expect to collect more data points for verifying the movement actions in the setup sequence.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is currently positioned in the bottom-left quadrant, surrounded by 'green_terrain_or_obstacles' and adjacent to a 'gray_marker'. It is also near the 'horizontal_pink_strip' and the blue border. This highly constrained position is likely preventing movement actions from having a direct effect on the 'player_like_object'. Previous attempts with ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 resulted in no movement for the 'player_like_object', but did trigger UI changes and 'movable_marker' movement. ACTION5 has had no visible effect recently, necessitating a change in board state before re-testing."
