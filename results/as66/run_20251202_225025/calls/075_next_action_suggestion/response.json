  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no observed effect in the previous state and appears to be conditional. We need to move the 'player_like_object' to a new, less constrained position to re-test it. The previous no-effect attempt for ACTION5 dictates a setup sequence first. ACTION3 (move left) can move the 'player_like_object' away from the green and gray obstacles. If ACTION3 fails, we try other movement. Since we can't observe the 'movable_marker' directly, we'll try to move the 'player_like_object' to a new location. We will attempt a sequence of verified actions (or actions with good progress towards verification) to shift the 'player_like_object' to a different area of the board, trying to get it away from the current cluster of 'green_terrain_or_obstacles' and the 'gray_marker'. We are using ACTION3 and ACTION1 to get off the bottom edge and away from the center, then ACTION4 to move right into a new area. If the 'player_like_object' doesn't move, the UI state will change, and effectively consume a turn, allowing us to re-test ACTION5 in a 'new' state. The overall goal is to get ACTION5 to have an effect so we can verify its behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to definitively observe the effect of ACTION5 on the 'player_like_object' and other game elements when the 'player_like_object' is in a different position. This will allow for further understanding of ACTION5's conditions for effect, especially concerning interactions with obstacles and other game objects. We also expect to collect more data points for verifying the movement actions in the setup sequence.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is currently positioned in the bottom-left quadrant, surrounded by 'green_terrain_or_obstacles' and adjacent to a 'gray_marker'. It is also near the 'horizontal_pink_strip' and the blue border. This highly constrained position is likely preventing movement actions from having a direct effect on the 'player_like_object'. Previous attempts with ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 resulted in no movement for the 'player_like_object', but did trigger UI changes and 'movable_marker' movement. ACTION5 has had no visible effect recently, necessitating a change in board state before re-testing."
