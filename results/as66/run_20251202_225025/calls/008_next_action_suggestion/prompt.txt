Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player_like_object (black U-shape) upwards, likely blocked by the top blue border or green_terrain_or_obstacles.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player_like_object (black U-shape) one unit downwards. It also causes the orange_object (small square) to move one unit downwards. This action triggers a UI change, where a 'move counter' at the top disappears and reappears at the bottom, indicating a successful action.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit to the LEFT. It also causes the 'orange_object' to move. The 'move counter' UI element changes its state from a color 14 block at the bottom to a color 12 at the bottom, and a new color 13 block at the top, and a new color 14 block on the left (likely indicating the axis of movement or a new type of counter).

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))
  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.
  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.
  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).
  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.
  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)
  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches (Role: Obstacles or terrain features)
  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What are the roles of the various colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area?
  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way?
  - Is the orange square a collectible that disappears upon contact, or a fixed goal?
  - What are the specific movement rules and constraints within the red background area, particularly regarding the green patches?
  - Is the black U-shaped object definitely the player? Could it be a static marker or another object type?

Legacy Objects:
  - player_like_object (Color 0 black U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - orange_object (Color 8 orange small square): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8 (disappeared) / row 56, col 8 (appeared): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (move counter, bottom): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 13 rectangular block (UI element, top): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element, left border): Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - The Color 8 (orange) small square is another 'movable_object', potentially a target or an object linked to player movement.
  - The thin 48x4 'Color 14 rectangular block' is likely a 'move counter' or 'turn indicator' element, which changes position (from top to bottom) upon a successful move.
  - ACTION3 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' left.
  - The 'orange_object' also moves with ACTION3, specifically down and left this time, confirming its linkage to player actions or its own movement rules.
  - The 'move counter' UI mechanism is more complex than a simple appearing/disappearing block. It involves color changes and new blocks appearing in different locations (top, left), possibly indicating different move types or states.
