  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has no observations yet, making it the highest priority for testing. All other observed actions have at least one attempt, and ACTION1 resulted in no effect. We should prioritize exploring unseen actions from the current state to maximize new information discovery before attempting to re-validate or re-test other actions.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to learn how ACTION4 (Move RIGHT) affects the player_like_object and potentially the orange_object, as well as its interaction with any game elements (borders, green_terrain_or_obstacles, UI elements). This will help in understanding basic movement mechanics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current player_like_object position seems suitable for testing rightward movement as it is not immediately adjacent to the right blue border or any obvious green_terrain_or_obstacles on its right side."
