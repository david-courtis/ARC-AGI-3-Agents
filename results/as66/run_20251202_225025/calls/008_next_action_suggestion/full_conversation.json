Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)\n2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)\n3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to\ndiscover context-dependent behaviors."

        "text": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):\n  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)\n  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)\n  ACTION3: Move LEFT (decrease column/x)\n  ACTION4: Move RIGHT (increase column/x)\n  ACTION5: INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player_like_object (black U-shape) upwards, likely blocked by the top blue border or green_terrain_or_obstacles.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player_like_object (black U-shape) one unit downwards. It also causes the orange_object (small square) to move one unit downwards. This action triggers a UI change, where a 'move counter' at the top disappears and reappears at the bottom, indicating a successful action.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit to the LEFT. It also causes the 'orange_object' to move. The 'move counter' UI element changes its state from a color 14 block at the bottom to a color 12 at the bottom, and a new color 13 block at the top, and a new color 14 block on the left (likely indicating the axis of movement or a new type of counter).\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nRECENT ACTION HISTORY (last 10 actions taken):\n  1. ACTION1: \u2717 NO EFFECT - The action ACTION1 was taken, but no visible changes occurre...\n  2. ACTION2: \u2713 EFFECT - The user-controlled object (black U-shape) moved downwards b...\n  3. ACTION3: \u2713 EFFECT - The user-controlled object (black U-shape) remained in its p...\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))\n  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.\n  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.\n  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).\n  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.\n  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches (Role: Obstacles or terrain features)\n  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What are the roles of the various colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area?\n  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way?\n  - Is the orange square a collectible that disappears upon contact, or a fixed goal?\n  - What are the specific movement rules and constraints within the red background area, particularly regarding the green patches?\n  - Is the black U-shaped object definitely the player? Could it be a static marker or another object type?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - player_like_object (Color 0 black U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - orange_object (Color 8 orange small square): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8 (disappeared) / row 56, col 8 (appeared): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (move counter, bottom): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (UI element, top): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element, left border): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Color 8 (orange) small square is another 'movable_object', potentially a target or an object linked to player movement.\n  - The thin 48x4 'Color 14 rectangular block' is likely a 'move counter' or 'turn indicator' element, which changes position (from top to bottom) upon a successful move.\n  - ACTION3 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' left.\n  - The 'orange_object' also moves with ACTION3, specifically down and left this time, confirming its linkage to player actions or its own movement rules.\n  - The 'move counter' UI mechanism is more complex than a simple appearing/disappearing block. It involves color changes and new blocks appearing in different locations (top, left), possibly indicating different move types or states.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
