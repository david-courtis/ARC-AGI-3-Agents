  "interpretation": "The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' remained stationary. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) and the 'gray_marker' (Color 12) both moved downwards by one unit. The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a vertical bar on the right disappeared, and a new 'Color 14 rectangular block (48x4)' appeared as a horizontal bar at the bottom. The color 12 vertical bars (UI element) also changed their positions and colors.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION2 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit downwards. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) attempts to move downwards. If the 'movable_marker' is present and not blocked, it will move one unit down. If a 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is present and not blocked, it will also move downwards. A successful full or partial move of any designated object (player, movable_marker, gray_marker) triggers a UI change: the color 14 rectangular block (move counter) moves from its current border (top, bottom, left, or right) to the bottom border, and the color 12 rectangular block (another UI element) moves from its current border (left or right) to the opposite border. These UI changes indicate a successful action attempt, regardless of which object actually moved or if any object moved at all.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) was blocked from moving downward by the 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) at row 60, col 0 and the blue border. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) and the 'gray_marker' (Color 12) were not blocked by any obstacles below them and were able to move one unit down. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",
