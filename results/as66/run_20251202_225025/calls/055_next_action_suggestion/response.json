  "reasoning": "ACTION1 is the only action that hasn't been tested at least 8 times. While it has recently been attempted, its definition notes an inverse movement for the 'movable_marker' if blocked, which suggests a nuanced behavior that needs more observation. Many actions have failed to move the 'player_like_object' recently, so direct player movement is unlikely. However, the 'movable_marker''s unique behavior and the 'gray_marker's dynamic appearance are still largely unverified. Furthermore, the 'player_like_object' is in a relatively open space compared to other attempts, providing a unique context for testing. Additionally, since the 'movable_marker' has a defined inverse movement, testing ACTION1 repeatedly might rapidly lead to its verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validation of ACTION1's behavior, especially the inverse movement of the 'movable_marker' when blocked and the behavior of the 'gray_marker' and other UI elements. We want to see if the 'player_like_object' is still blocked from moving up by the current environmental setup, and if so, how the other elements react.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is positioned in the lower-left quadrant of the red game area, adjacent to the blue border on the left. There's a small green patch above it and a larger one to its right. The 'gray_marker' is present near the bottom-right green patch. The 'horizontal_pink_strip' is at the bottom. This position is relatively open compared to previous attempts where the 'player_like_object' was often directly against obstacles or borders. This open space might allow for different outcomes for ACTION1."
