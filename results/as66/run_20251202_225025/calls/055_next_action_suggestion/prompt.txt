Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 6/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) upwards by one unit. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also attempts to move the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) upwards by one unit. However, if the 'movable_marker' is blocked from moving up by a green terrain feature, it moves one unit downwards instead. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) seems to move in the same direction as the 'movable_marker' or can also appear at a dynamically determined position. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (left -> top -> right -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars) also seem to rotate on the side borders and change color: when the Color 14 bar is at the top, the left side Color 12 bar is blue and the right side is light-pink, and vice-versa when the Color 14 bar is at the bottom (left light-pink, right blue).
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit downwards. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) attempts to move downwards. If the 'movable_marker' is present and not blocked, it will move one unit down. If a 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is present and not blocked, it will also move downwards. A successful full or partial move of any designated object (player, movable_marker, gray_marker) triggers a UI change: the color 14 rectangular block (move counter) moves from its current border (top, bottom, left, or right) to the bottom border, and the color 12 rectangular block (another UI element) moves from its current border (left or right) to the opposite border. These UI changes indicate a successful action attempt, regardless of which object actually moved or if any object moved at all.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit to the LEFT. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, its movement is prevented. A 'movable_marker' (Color 11) also moves one unit to the LEFT, if not blocked. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, its movement is prevented. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 rectangular blocks) change their positions and/or colors upon action, with the Color 14 block cycling its position among the borders (currently from top to left), and the Color 12 block (border UI element) changing its color (from blue to light-pink) when on the left border. Other Color 12 UI elements may also appear at new locations or change due to this action.
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 7/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, a 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will consistently move right instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element which cycles its position around the outer borders of the play area (top, right, bottom, left). The color 12 rectangular UI element, forming the side borders, also changes color and position dynamically, often mirroring the status of the color 14 block or indicating a consumed move, with a consistent pattern of change to light-pink on the new current side and blue on the previous side.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' to an unknown direction. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moves up by one unit.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))
  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.
  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.
  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).
  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.
  - The failure of ACTION5, with no visible changes to any identified object, suggests that either the 'player_like_object' was blocked by an environmental element (orange_object, green_terrain_or_obstacles, or the blue border), or ACTION5 is an action that only has an effect under specific conditions, or it is a 'no-op' action in this state.
  - The 'orange_object' (collectible/target) is no longer visible, suggesting it was either collected, moved off-screen, or disappeared after an action. This strengthens the hypothesis of it being a collectible.
  - A new 'gray_marker' (Color 12) appeared within the play area, adjacent to the 'player_like_object'. This could be a new obstacle, an interactable element, or a UI element that appears dynamically in front of the player.
  - A 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) has appeared at the bottom of the main play area, within the blue border. This could be a new UI indicator, a score element, or a boundary that was previously not visible.
  - The failure of ACTION2 confirms that downward movement is blocked for the 'player_like_object' in its current position. This could be due to the blue border at the bottom, the newly appeared 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'.
  - Confirmed that the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is an independently movable object that can move even if the 'player_like_object' does not.
  - The 'player_like_object' remaining stationary while the 'movable_marker' moved implies that ACTION5's effect on the 'player_like_object' can be conditional or it has a secondary effect on other objects if the primary target is blocked.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.
  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.
  - Movement was not affected by ACTION5, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state.
  - ACTION5 had no effect, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state. The 'player_like_object' is adjacent to green patches and a new gray object on its right, and the blue border on its left. This suggests strong blocking in multiple directions.
  - ACTION2 (move down) had no visible effect. Given the player_like_object is near the bottom of the play area and above the 'horizontal_pink_strip', it is likely blocked by either the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal green obstacles.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - green_terrain_or_obstacles

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS:
  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)
  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches of pixels (Role: Obstacles or terrain features that block movement)
  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)
  - gray_marker: Color 12 (gray) Small square (1x1) (Role: Movement tracker/Progress indicator or an interactable object.)
  - horizontal_pink_strip: Color 13 (light-pink) Thin horizontal strip at the bottom of the blue border (Role: UI Element / Boundary element)
  - movable_marker: Color 11 Rectangular block (Role: Secondary player/collectible/dynamic obstacle/indicator)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What are the roles of the various layered colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area, especially the new pink stripe?
  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way when the 'player_like_object' is adjacent or within them?
  - What caused the 'orange_object' to disappear? Was it collected by the 'player_like_object', or did it move off-screen due to ACTION5, or something else?
  - What is the specific role of the newly appeared 'gray_marker'? Is it an obstacle, a trigger, or a dynamic UI element within the play area itself?
  - What is the exact boundary or obstacle that blocked ACTION2 (move down) for the 'player_like_object'? Is it the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'?
  - Does the movement of the 'movable_marker' have any spatial constraints or interactions with other objects or boundaries?

Recent Observations:
  - The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) has an inverse movement behavior for ACTION1; if blocked from moving up, it moves down.
  - Confirmed that the 'player_like_object' does not move if blocked from its intended direction, even if another object (movable_marker) moves.
  - The UI element transformation from horizontal bar at the top to a vertical bar on the left for Color 14 reinforces the idea of a cyclical movement of this element around the borders.
  - The Color 12 UI element also shifted its appearance/color, further indicating its role as a state or move indicator.
  - The Color 12 UI elements (borders) appear to rotate their 'light-pink' state clockwise along with the Color 14 UI element. When Color 14 moves from left to right, the left Color 12 becomes blue and the right Color 12 becomes light-pink. This suggests a rotational pattern for both UI elements.
