  "reasoning": "ACTION3 is a pending action that has not had a recent 'no effect' attempt (last no-effect was 2 attempts ago). Additionally, the player_like_object is currently positioned towards the left-center of the screen, adjacent to the blue border (left) and green terrain (right and above), and the gray_marker is to its lower right. This position offers a good opportunity to test movement to the left to see if it can move past the blue border or has distinct interaction with the green terrain.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Testing ACTION3 will help us understand: 1. If the 'player_like_object' can move left in this position, confirming previous observations or revealing new blocking elements. 2. How the 'movable_marker' (if present) and 'gray_marker' (Color 12) react to ACTION3 when the 'player_like_object' is in this specific configuration. 3. Further validate or refute the current definitions of UI changes for ACTION3.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is on the left side of the playable area, blocked to the left by the border and surrounded by green terrain and the gray_marker. This state is suitable for testing left movement (ACTION3) as it will reveal interaction with the blue border and potentially the green terrain. Crucially, I am not retrying a 'no effect' action in the same state, as ACTION3 had a successful effect 2 attempts ago."
