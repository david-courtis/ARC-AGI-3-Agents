  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has more consistent observations than the other actions (1/3). Other actions have 0/3. It also had a 'NO EFFECT' recently, but the game state has changed significantly since then. Specifically, the 'player_like_object' is now in a different position. The previous 'NO EFFECT' attempt for ACTION1 was when the 'player_like_object' was against the bottom border or a green obstacle. In the current state, the 'player_like_object' is higher up and to the left, away from any obvious upward blocks, making it a good candidate to re-test if it can move freely or if there are other upward obstacles.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We want to confirm if ACTION1 allows free upward movement for the 'player_like_object' in this new position. If it moves, we gain another consistent observation. If it's blocked, we'll identify the new blocking element. We also want to observe the interaction with the 'orange_object', which was part of ACTION1's definition previously, but the 'orange_object' is not visible currently. This will help refine ACTION1's definition and potentially verify if its effect on 'orange_object' is primary or secondary.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is currently located on the left-middle side of the board, not directly adjacent to the top border or any immediate green obstacles directly above it. There are green obstacles below and to the right. A 'gray_marker' is to its right, and a pink UI strip on left border. This position should allow for upward movement if not constrained by an invisible boundary or very subtle obstacle."
