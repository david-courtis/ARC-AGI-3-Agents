  "interpretation": "The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' remained stationary. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moved one unit downwards. The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a horizontal bar at the bottom disappeared, and a new 'Color 14 rectangular block' appeared as a vertical bar on the right. The color 12 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a blue vertical bar on the left border, changed to a light-pink vertical bar on the left border.",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION2 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit downwards. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) attempts to move downwards. If the 'movable_marker' is present and not blocked, it will move one unit down. There is an observed movement of one unit right for the 'movable_marker' in a previous observation, but this seems to be an anomaly or related to a different context, as this observation and a previous one solely show downward movement. If a 'gray_marker' (Color 12) is present and not blocked, it will also move downwards. A successful full or partial move of any designated object (player, movable_marker, gray_marker) triggers a UI change: the color 14 rectangular block (move counter) moves from its current border (top, bottom, left, or right) to the bottom border. A new observation suggests the color 14 rectangular block moves from its current border (top, bottom, left or right) to the right border when Action2 is taken. The color 12 rectangular block (another UI element) moves from its current border (left or right) to the opposite border and changes color.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) was blocked from moving downward by the green terrain feature (12x8 shape at 40,28), the 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) at row 60, col 0, or the blue border. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) was not blocked by any obstacles below it and was able to move one unit down. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted. The 'movable_marker' moved only downward, not downward and right as previously observed, suggesting the previous combined movement was an anomaly or context-specific.",

    "The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moved only downwards in this instance, contradicting a previous observation of simultaneous downward and right movement, suggesting that combined movement might be context specific or the previous observation was anomalous.",
    "The Color 14 rectangular block (move counter) consistently moves to the right border in this new observation of ACTION2, which is different from previous observations where it moved to the bottom border. This indicates a more complex or cyclical pattern for the move counter's position."
