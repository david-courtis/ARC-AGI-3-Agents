  "reasoning": "ACTION3 currently has only 1/3 consistent observations and is marked as 'pending'. Since the action had an effect in the prior attempts, and we haven't verified it yet, it is a priority to test it again in the current state to gather more observations for verification. All recent actions were 'no-effect' for the player, but the prompt states if 'an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again in the same state!'. However, for ACTION3, this condition isn't met because the 'movable_marker' did move. Therefore, we should try ACTION3 again immediately to get more data points.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further clarify the conditions under which ACTION3 moves both the 'player_like_object' and the 'movable_marker', and whether it consistently updates the UI elements as described. We also want to observe if the 'player_like_object' remains completely stationary or if there are specific blocking entities for its left movement.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in a seemingly constrained position, surrounded by green terrain, the 'gray_marker', and the blue border. Its movement is currently greatly restricted. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is present and appears to be less constrained in its movement. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) continue to provide feedback on action attempts."
