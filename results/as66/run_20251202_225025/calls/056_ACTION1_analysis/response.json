The color 12 rectangular block (UI element) which was previously a blue vertical bar on the left border, now appears to be a light-pink vertical bar on the left border.

  "new_definition": "ACTION1 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) upwards by one unit. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also attempts to move the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) upwards by one unit. If the 'movable_marker' is blocked from moving up by a green terrain feature, it moves one unit downwards instead; otherwise, if not blocked from moving up, it moves one unit up. The 'gray_marker' (Color 12) seems to move in the same direction as the 'movable_marker'. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position counter-clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (right -> top -> left -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars on left/right border) also follow a rotational pattern, changing color (blue/light-pink) and position (left/right) based on the position of the Color 14 bar, with the light-pink bar appearing opposite to the direction the Color 14 bar is moving from.",

The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",
