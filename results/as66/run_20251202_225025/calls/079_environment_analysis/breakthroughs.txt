1. Confirmed that ACTION2 blocks downward movement for the 'player_like_object' in its current position, while allowing the 'movable_marker' to move down. This reinforces independent movement constraints for different objects and helps narrow down the blocking element for the 'player_like_object' to either the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or directly underneath the 'green_terrain_or_obstacles'.
