The 'player_like_object' is adjacent to green patches and a new gray object on its right, and the blue border on its left. This suggests strong blocking in multiple directions.",
    "ACTION2 (move down) had no visible effect. Given the player_like_object is near the bottom of the play area and above the 'horizontal_pink_strip', it is likely blocked by either the blue border, the 'horizontal_pink_strip', or the internal green obstacles.",
    "The 'player_like_object' remained stationary during ACTION3, even though the 'movable_marker' did move. This confirms that the 'player_like_object' was blocked to the left in its current position, likely by the blue border or an internal obstacle not explicitly identified as 'green terrain'.",
