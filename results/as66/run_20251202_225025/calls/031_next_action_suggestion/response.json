  "reasoning": "ACTION4 needs more validation and has one less attempt than ACTION2. The 'player_like_object' is currently not blocked to its right by the border, although there is green terrain further right. Testing ACTION4 in this state will help us observe if the player object or the 'movable_marker' (Color 11) moves, and how the UI elements react. Since ACTION4's last attempt resulted in a 'gray_marker' (now confirmed as 'movable_marker') moving, it's not a 'no-effect' action that requires a setup sequence.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further clarify the behavior of ACTION4, specifically which object moves when and how, and how the UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 blocks) respond. This will contribute towards its verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in the bottom-left quadrant, with green terrain to its right and above. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is below and to the right of the player object. The 'horizontal_pink_strip' (Color 13) is at the bottom. The player object does not seem immediately blocked to its right. ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION5 had no effect recently, requiring a different state to re-test them. ACTION3 was recently tested and had an effect. Therefore, ACTION4 is a good candidate to test next given it has not been tested after the last effect, and it has not had a recent 'no effect' result."
