  "new_definition": "ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, a 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will consistently move right instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element which cycles its position around the outer borders of the play area (top, right, bottom, left). The color 12 rectangular UI element, forming the side borders, also changes color and position dynamically, often mirroring the status of the color 14 block or indicating a consumed move, with a consistent pattern of changing to light-pink on the new current side and blue on the previous side. The black U-shaped 'player_like_object' is unable to move due to various obstacles, specifically the green terrain features (shapes at 12,12), the 12x16 shape at 20,32, the 12x8 shape at 40,28, and the 8x8 shape at 44,44) or the blue border.",

The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked by any obstacles to its right and was able to move one unit right. The UI elements updated their positions and colors to reflect a registered action, continuing their cyclical pattern.",
