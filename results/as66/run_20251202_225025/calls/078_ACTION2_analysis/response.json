  "new_definition": "ACTION2 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit downwards. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked, other designated objects, such as 'movable_marker' (Color 11), may move. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) will attempt to move one unit downwards. It may also move horizontally in conjunction with the downward movement in specific contexts, but primarily moves down. The UI change: the color 14 rectangular block (move counter) moves from its current border (top, bottom, left, or right) to the bottom border. The color 12 rectangular block (another UI element) changes its position and color (light-pink/blue) on the left/right borders.",

The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked by any obstacles below it and was able to move one unit down. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 bars) updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",
