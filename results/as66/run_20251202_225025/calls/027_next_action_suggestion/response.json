  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 is one of the least observed actions (1/8 attempts) and is not yet consistent. While ACTION2 and ACTION4 also have low consistency, the current observation describes ACTION3 as moving the 'player_like_object' to the LEFT, which seems possible given its current position without immediate obstruction. It also notes how ACTION3 affects the UI 'move counter', which provides an additional observable effect for validation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We aim to gain more observations for ACTION3 to move it towards consistency. Specifically, we want to confirm if it moves the 'player_like_object' left, how it interacts with the 'orange_object' (if present), and to further validate the UI changes described. Moving left might reveal new game elements or allow for testing other actions in a new context.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is on the left side of the screen, but not at the absolute edge of the blue border. There's open space to its left before hitting the blue border. There are no immediate obstacles (green terrain or gray marker) to its left. Thus, the current position is suitable for testing a left movement action."
