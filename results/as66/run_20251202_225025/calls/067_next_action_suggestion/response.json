  "reasoning": "ACTION2 had no effect recently. According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, it must be retried after a setup sequence that moves the agent to a different position. Currently, all movement actions for the 'player_like_object' are unverified, but we do have some control over the 'movable_marker'. However, the instruction emphasizes using verified movement actions. Since no movement actions are verified for the 'player_like_object', I am using a sequence of unverified movement actions that have previously moved the 'movable_marker' successfully, with the attempt to also move the player to a new position. I will attempt to move right (ACTION4), then up (ACTION1), then right again (ACTION4). This sequence aims to move the 'player_like_object' away from its current blocked position if possible, and definitely move the 'movable_marker' to a new location. After this setup, I will re-test ACTION2. The 'player_like_object' is currently at the bottom-left of the main red area. Moving right and up should provide a new context for testing ACTION2. The chosen sequence uses previously observed effects on the 'movable_marker' for ACTION1 and ACTION4 to guarantee some movement, and hopes that 'player_like_object' might also move in a different context. I am prioritizing testing the pending action (ACTION2) that had no effect recently.",
  "expected_information_gain": "I expect to observe if ACTION2 moves the 'player_like_object' or 'movable_marker' in this new position, helping to verify its definition and understand its movement constraints. If it still doesn't move the 'player_like_object', I will gain more information about what is blocking it. We also want to see how the UI elements respond in this new state. We could also potentially identify consistent movement for ACTION1 and ACTION4 if the 'player_like_object' moves during the setup sequence.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is in the bottom-left part of the red area, adjacent to the left blue border and a green obstacle above and to its right. The 'movable_marker' is just above and to the right of the 'player_like_object', near a green patch. The 'player_like_object' has consistently been blocked from moving in all previously tested directions (up, down, left, right). The current position is not ideal for testing movement actions that have previously failed. The 'movable_marker' has shown movement with ACTION1, ACTION3, and ACTION4, so it offers a way to change the state of the game, even if the 'player_like_object' doesn't move during the setup. There's a gray marker near the 'movable_marker' that could also be affected by movement. The 'horizontal_pink_strip' is at the bottom of the main play area."
