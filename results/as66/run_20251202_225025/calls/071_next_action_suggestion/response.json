  "reasoning": "ACTION5 just had no effect in the previous turn and would be a poor immediate choice. ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION3 also recently had no effect for the 'player_like_object', and therefore should be avoided in the current position without a setup sequence. While ACTION4 also recently had no effect on the 'player_like_object', its definition states that if the player is blocked, the 'movable_marker' will consistently move right instead. Given that the 'player_like_object' is in a corner-like position and movement seems highly constrained, testing ACTION4 could potentially confirm the 'movable_marker's' behavior and/or clarify if the 'player_like_object' is blocked by the internal 'green_terrain_or_obstacles' or the blue border.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION4 causes the 'movable_marker' to move to the right, even if the 'player_like_object' remains stationary. This will help confirm the consistent movement of the 'movable_marker' as a fallback, and could potentially reveal if the 'player_like_object' is blocked by the green terrain on its right, or if it is able to move right. We also want to observe the UI changes, specifically the Color 14 and Color 12 rectangular blocks, as these patterns have been inconsistent across actions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is currently positioned in the bottom-left area of the main play area, surrounded by the blue border on its left, the 'horizontal_pink_strip' below it, and 'green_terrain_or_obstacles' and the 'gray_marker' to its right and above. It has been blocked from moving up, down, and left in recent attempts. ACTION5 also had no effect. This suggests the 'player_like_object' is highly constrained. The 'movable_marker' (Color 11) is currently above and to the right of the 'player_like_object', next to the 'gray_marker' (Color 12). The 'horizontal_pink_strip' is at the bottom of the play area. The current state is highly constrained for the 'player_like_object', but it is a good state to test the 'movable_marker' behavior for ACTION4."
