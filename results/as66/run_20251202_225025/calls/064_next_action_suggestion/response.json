  ],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had 2 recent 'no effect' attempts. The rule states to use a setup sequence to move to a new position before retrying a 'no effect' action. Since all movement actions are not yet verified, and the player_like_object is currently blocked in all directions by either borders, green terrain, or the gray_marker, a setup sequence is necessary. Given ACTION1 has not yet been able to move the player_like_object up, it is a good candidate to test if moving the movable_marker or gray_marker slightly changes the environment for the player. Following it with ACTION4 (move right) aims to further move the player_like_object to a more open space, away from the left border and the gray_marker, which might give ACTION5 a chance to have a different effect. We prioritize testing ACTION5 as it has the fewest attempts among the pending actions and has been blocked.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the 'player_like_object' to a new position using ACTION1 and ACTION4 before attempting ACTION5, we hope to disambiguate if ACTION5 has no effect due to environmental blocking or if it's a no-op in many contexts. We specifically want to see if the 'player_like_object' moves now, or if the 'movable_marker' moves in a different way, which would help us fully define ACTION5's behavior. Additionally, further testing ACTION1 and ACTION4 in the setup sequence will contribute to their verification counts.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is currently in a very constrained position, blocked on all sides by either the blue border, green terrain, or the gray_marker. This state is not conducive to testing actions for their full range of effects, especially actions that have recently failed to produce an effect. Moving to a more open area is critical for further exploration and verifying action behaviors. The 'movable_marker' is currently at the bottom right, and the 'gray_marker' at the bottom center, near the player. All movement actions for the 'player_like_object' have been shown to be blocked in the current configuration."
