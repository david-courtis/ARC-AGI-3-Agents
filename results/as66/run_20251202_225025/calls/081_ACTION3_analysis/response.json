A 'movable_marker' (Color 11) attempts to move one unit to the LEFT. If additionally not blocked from moving down, it can move down one unit as well. The UI elements (Color 14 and Color 12 rectangular blocks) change their positions and/or colors upon action, with the Color 14 block cycling its position among the borders (currently from bottom to left), and the Color 12 block (border UI element) changing its color (from blue to light-pink) when on the left border. Other Color 12 UI elements may also appear at new locations or change due to this action.",

The 'movable_marker' (Color 11 rectangular block) was not blocked by any obstacles to its left and was able to move one unit left. It also appears to have moved one unit down, suggesting an unblocked downward path or an interaction with the green terrain. The UI elements updated their positions and colors to reflect that an action was attempted.",
