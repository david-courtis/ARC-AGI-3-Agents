  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 attempts to move the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) upwards by one unit. If the 'player_like_object' is blocked (by a border or an obstacle like the green terrain), it remains stationary. Separately, this action also moves an 'orange_object' upwards by one unit, regardless of whether the 'player_like_object' moves. A 'move counter' UI element (color 14 bar) rotates its position clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (left -> top -> right -> bottom, etc.) on each successful action or attempted valid action. Other UI elements (color 12 bars) also seem to rotate on the side borders inversely to the color 14 block.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player_like_object (black U-shape) one unit downwards. It also causes the orange_object (small square) to move one unit downwards. This action triggers a UI change, where a 'move counter' at the top disappears and reappears at the bottom, indicating a successful action.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the 'player_like_object' (black U-shape) one unit to the LEFT. It also causes the 'orange_object' to move. The 'move counter' UI element changes its state from a color 14 block at the bottom to a color 12 at the bottom, and a new color 13 block at the top, and a new color 14 block on the left (likely indicating the axis of movement or a new type of counter).\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4, intended as 'move right', attempts to move the black U-shaped 'player_like_object' one unit right. If the player object is blocked, the 'orange_object' might move left instead. The action consumes a 'move' as indicated by the movement of a color 14 rectangular UI element.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 1 (blue))\n  Description: A thick blue rectangle forms the immediate border of the play area. Outside this blue border there is a thin light-cyan border, then a thin green border, then a thin yellow border at the bottom and a thin light-pink border at the top and finally a thick light-cyan border around the entire game frame. The outermost border is light-cyan colored.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Rectangular play area with a grid-like implicit structure, containing irregularly shaped terrain/obstacles.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified a clear, thick blue border defining the main play area.\n  - Discovered a complex layered border outside the main play area, suggesting meta-game elements or distinct zones.\n  - Identified 'player-like' object (black U-shape) and possible 'terrain/obstacles' (green patches) and a 'target/collectible' (orange square).\n  - The failure of ACTION1 confirms the presence of boundaries or obstacles in the upward direction for the black 'player-like' object.\n  - The failure of ACTION5, with no visible changes to any identified object, suggests that either the 'player_like_object' was blocked by an environmental element (orange_object, green_terrain_or_obstacles, or the blue border), or ACTION5 is an action that only has an effect under specific conditions, or it is a 'no-op' action in this state.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Movement is constrained by the blue border.\n  - ACTION1 (move up) had no effect, suggesting a boundary or an obstacle prevented upward movement. Since the player-like object is at the bottom of the visible objects, it's possible it hit the 'green terrain' or a hidden boundary when trying to move up.\n  - Movement was not affected by ACTION5, implying either an immovable object or a boundary was encountered, or the action itself had no effect in the current state.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS:\n  - player_like_object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable agent)\n  - green_terrain_or_obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped patches (Role: Obstacles or terrain features)\n  - orange_object: Color 8 (orange) Small square (Role: Collectible or target)\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What are the roles of the various colored borders surrounding the main blue-bordered play area?\n  - Do the green patches act as impassable obstacles, or do they alter movement in some other way?\n  - Is the orange square a collectible that disappears upon contact, or a fixed goal?\n  - What are the specific movement rules and constraints within the red background area, particularly regarding the green patches?\n  - Is the black U-shaped object definitely the player? Could it be a static marker or another object type?\n  - What specific condition(s) might prevent ACTION5 from having a visible effect? Was the 'player_like_object' blocked by any of the existing objects or boundaries?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - player_like_object (Color 0 black U-shaped block): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - orange_object (Color 8 orange small square): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at row 4, col 8 (disappeared) / row 56, col 8 (appeared): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (move counter, bottom): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (UI element, top): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element, left border): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - player_like_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - orange_object: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5, when executed in this context, has no visible effect on the player object, orange object, or UI elements.\n  - ACTION5 might be a 'no-op' if no valid target for interaction/selection/rotation is present or if the 'player_like_object' is not in a position to perform such an action.\n  - The 'orange_object' demonstrates independent movement from the 'player_like_object' and consistently moves in the intended direction of the action, even if the 'player_like_object' is blocked.\n  - The color 14 rectangular block (UI element) rotates clockwise around the perimeter of the play area (left -> top -> right -> bottom) with each action, consuming a 'move'.\n  - The vertical color 12 rectangular block UI elements on the sides also seem to shift position, specifically from right to left in this observation, possibly indicating a broader 'move counter' or game state tracking mechanism.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

    "reasoning": "ACTION1 resulted in 'NO EFFECT' in the previous attempt from the current position. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to reach a different position before re-testing an action that had no effect. Since no actions are fully verified yet, we prioritize actions that are still pending validation. ACTION2 and ACTION3 have had only 1 attempt each so far, making them good candidates for the setup sequence. Moving the player ensures a different state for ACTION1 to be re-evaluated. The current position of the 'player_like_object' is near the bottom of the screen, close to some green terrain. Moving it down will likely be blocked by the border but might reveal more about ACTION2's 'orange_object' movement and the UI element changes, pushing it left would move it away from the green terrain and potentially provide different results for subsequent ACTION1. We need to explore how each action behaves when the 'player_like_object' is in different locations relative to the 'orange_object', other obstacles, or the borders.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By moving to a new position, we aim to observe if ACTION1 (Move UP) still has no effect, or if its effect is context-dependent. Specifically, we want to see if moving away from the previously encountered obstacle (possibly the green terrain or the bottom border) allows the 'player_like_object' to move up. We also hope to gain more consistent observations for ACTION2 and ACTION3 during the setup sequence, moving us closer to verifying their behaviors.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is currently at the bottom-center of the play area, slightly to the left, near some green terrain. The 'orange_object' is to its upper-left. The previous ACTION1 attempt failed, suggesting an obstacle or border above the 'player_like_object'. The current state is not ideal for retesting ACTION1 without moving, as it previously had no effect."
