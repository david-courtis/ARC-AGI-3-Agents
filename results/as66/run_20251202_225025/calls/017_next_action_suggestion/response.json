  "reasoning": "ACTION1 resulted in 'NO EFFECT' in the previous attempt from the current position. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to reach a different position before re-testing an action that had no effect. Since no actions are fully verified yet, we prioritize actions that are still pending validation. ACTION2 and ACTION3 have had only 1 attempt each so far, making them good candidates for the setup sequence. Moving the player ensures a different state for ACTION1 to be re-evaluated. The current position of the 'player_like_object' is near the bottom of the screen, close to some green terrain. Moving it down will likely be blocked by the border but might reveal more about ACTION2's 'orange_object' movement and the UI element changes, pushing it left would move it away from the green terrain and potentially provide different results for subsequent ACTION1. We need to explore how each action behaves when the 'player_like_object' is in different locations relative to the 'orange_object', other obstacles, or the borders.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving to a new position, we aim to observe if ACTION1 (Move UP) still has no effect, or if its effect is context-dependent. Specifically, we want to see if moving away from the previously encountered obstacle (possibly the green terrain or the bottom border) allows the 'player_like_object' to move up. We also hope to gain more consistent observations for ACTION2 and ACTION3 during the setup sequence, moving us closer to verifying their behaviors.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The 'player_like_object' is currently at the bottom-center of the play area, slightly to the left, near some green terrain. The 'orange_object' is to its upper-left. The previous ACTION1 attempt failed, suggesting an obstacle or border above the 'player_like_object'. The current state is not ideal for retesting ACTION1 without moving, as it previously had no effect."
