  "expected_information_gain": "Determine if ACTION4 causes movement (and in which direction), interacts with objects, or changes the environment in any way. This will provide the first observation for ACTION4's effects.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing a general movement action like ACTION4. The U-shaped object (assumed player) is in a central position, allowing for movement in multiple directions without immediately hitting a boundary."
