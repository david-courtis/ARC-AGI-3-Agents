Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 can cause a Color 14 block to change color to Color 12. It can also cause a Color 8 block to move down and can cause new blocks to appear (Color 13 at (0,25) and Color 14 at (56,8)).
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 causes a Color 8 block to move left, and may cause existing Color 14 blocks to disappear and new Color 14 blocks to appear in a different location/orientation.
  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 7 (red)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))
  Description: Multiple layered borders: outermost is Color 3 (green), inside that is Color 8 (cyan), then Color 1 (blue) outlining the main red play area. There's also a thin pink bar at the bottom and a thin green/magenta line at the very top, suggesting broader screen boundaries.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  A grid-based or pixel-based game with a central rectangular play area surrounded by multiple layers of borders. Objects are placed discretely on this grid.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified new UI elements: a small purple rectangular block (Color 13) that appeared at the top, and a very thin pink bar at the bottom. These likely serve as move counters or progress indicators, and they change with actions.
  - Confirmed that objects can change color: a Color 14 block changed to Color 12, indicating interactable elements that modify the environment.
  - Confirmed object movement: a Color 8 block moved downwards, indicating dynamic game elements.
  - Discovered new objects can appear: a Color 13 block at (0, 25) and a Color 14 block at (56, 8) appeared. This suggests dynamic level generation or additional game elements being introduced.
  - Confirmed the appearance and disappearance of Color 14 blocks, and discovered they can change orientation/shape, going from (48x4) at (56,8) to (4x48) at (8,4). This strongly indicates they are dynamic, interactable level elements rather than static boundaries or always appearing in the same form. This contradicts the 'new Color 14 block at (56,8)' hypothesis from earlier and replaces it with a more nuanced understanding of dynamic Color 14 elements.
  - Discovered the Color 14 block at (56,8) 'disappeared' (was replaced/moved) and a new Color 14 block appeared at (8,4), along the left side. This suggests these blocks might be 'platforms' or dynamic walls that appear/disappear on the sides, changing the navigable space.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Movement appears to be confined within the outermost green border, and possibly more strictly within the inner blue border.
  - Movement appears to be confined within the outermost green border.
  - Movement appears to be more strictly confined within the inner blue border.
  - The Color 8 rectangular block moved left without apparent obstruction.

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Play Area Background: Color 7 (red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: Main game board or playfield)
      Evidence: It occupies the majority of the inner frame and objects move within it.
  - Small green blob: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of 1-3 pixels (Role hypothesis: Obstacle or collectible)
      Evidence: They are scattered within the play area and their interaction with other objects is unknown. They slightly change shape/position but are not animated.
  - Blue Border: Color 1 (blue) Thick rectangular frame (Role hypothesis: Inner boundary/wall)
      Evidence: It encloses the primary play area and objects appear to be confined by it.
  - Cyan Border: Color 8 (cyan) Thin rectangular frame (Role hypothesis: Middle boundary/wall)
      Evidence: It is outside the blue border and appears to further constrain movement within the total game area.
  - Green Border: Color 3 (green) Thin rectangular frame (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary/wall)
      Evidence: It is the outermost visible border, suggesting it forms the ultimate edge of the navigable space.
  - U-shaped object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role hypothesis: Player or controllable object)
      Evidence: It is a distinct shape and position within the play area, often indicating a central game element. Its movement patterns would confirm this.
  - Orange square: Color 4 (orange) 1x1 square (Role hypothesis: Collectible or target)
      Evidence: It is a small, distinct object within the play area. Its interaction with the U-shaped object or other elements needs more observation.
  - Red/Color 12 rectangular block: Color 12 (pinkish red) Rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Interactable object / Target)
      Evidence: Observation that a 'Color 14' block changed to 'Color 12' suggests it's a dynamic element resulting from an interaction.
  - Bottom UI element: Color 6 (pink) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role hypothesis: UI/progress indicator)
      Evidence: Located at the bottom edge, it's outside the main play area and changed in a prior action, suggesting a role in tracking game state.
  - Top UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role hypothesis: UI/progress indicator)
      Evidence: Located at the top edge, outside the main play area, and appeared in a prior action, indicating a role in tracking game state similar to the pink bar.
  - Movable Cyan Block: Color 8 (cyan) 4x4 rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Movable object or player element)
      Evidence: It visibly moved from (28,40) to the left, confirming its movability.
  - Large Dynamic Block (Color 14): Color 14 (light pink) Rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Dynamic level element / obstacle)
      Evidence: A large block of this color appeared, and another instance disappeared and reappeared in a different orientation. This implies it's a dynamic part of the environment, possibly movable or destructible obstacles or part of the level structure that changes.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What is the exact function of the Color 13 (magenta) and Color 6 (pink) UI elements? Do they count moves, indicate progress, or something else? How are they affected by specific actions?
  - What happens when the Color 12 block (pinkish red) is interacted with further?
  - What is the role of the scattered green blobs across the play area? Do they block movement, or are they collectibles?
  - What happens when a Color 8 block hits another object during its movement?
  - How do the dynamic Color 14 blocks affect player movement or other game elements? Are they temporary obstacles, destructible, or part of a puzzle?
  - What is the role of the U-shaped black object and the orange square?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4,8): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16,40): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0,25): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 8 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION3 action
  - New Color 14 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - The environment can spontaneously generate new objects (Color 13, Color 14) as a result of an action.
  - A Color 14 block can be transformed into a Color 12 block by ACTION2.
  - ACTION2 can cause a Color 8 block to move downwards. The exact distance is not fully determinable from a single frame.
  - The Color 14 rectangular block that appeared at (56,8) due to ACTION2 disappeared, and a new Color 14 block appeared at a new location (8,4). This suggests these objects may not represent persistent entities across actions, or their positions are reset/regenerated.
  - The role of the 'Color 14 rectangular block' is becoming clearer: it appears to be a dynamic, large block that can appear/disappear and change location, possibly representing a new 'zone' or element of the level that changes with actions, potentially for a new 'stage' rather than a standard movable object for the player.
