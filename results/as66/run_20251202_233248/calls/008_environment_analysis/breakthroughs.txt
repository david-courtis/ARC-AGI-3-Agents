1. Confirmed the appearance and disappearance of Color 14 blocks, and discovered they can change orientation/shape, going from (48x4) at (56,8) to (4x48) at (8,4). This strongly indicates they are dynamic, interactable level elements rather than static boundaries or always appearing in the same form. This contradicts the 'new Color 14 block at (56,8)' hypothesis from earlier and replaces it with a more nuanced understanding of dynamic Color 14 elements.
2. Discovered the Color 14 block at (56,8) 'disappeared' (was replaced/moved) and a new Color 14 block appeared at (8,4), along the left side. This suggests these blocks might be 'platforms' or dynamic walls that appear/disappear on the sides, changing the navigable space.
