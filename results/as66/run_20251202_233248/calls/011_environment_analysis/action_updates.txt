ACTION3: ACTION3 causes a Color 8 block to move left, and may cause existing Color 14 blocks to disappear and new Color 14 blocks to appear in a different location/orientation.
  Reason: The action definition is consistent across observations.

ACTION4: ACTION4 causes a Color 8 block to move right, and may cause existing Color 14 blocks to appear/disappear along the left/right boundaries of the play area.
  Reason: This observation explicitly shows ACTION4 moving the Color 8 block to the right and also involved the appearance of a Color 14 block at (8,56) and disappearance of one at (8,4), which aligns with the dynamic boundary role.
