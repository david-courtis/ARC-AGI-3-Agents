BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nIMPORTANT: ANIMATION LIMITATION!\n- We only see ONE frame after each action (not the full animation)\n- In sliding puzzle games, objects may slide multiple units but we only see the FIRST step\n- If an object moved, the DIRECTION is reliable but the DISTANCE may be incomplete\n- Objects may have slid further than what the single frame shows\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

There's also a thin pink bar at the bottom and a thin green/magenta line at the very top, suggesting broader screen boundaries.\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the outermost green border, and possibly more strictly within the inner blue border.\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the outermost green border.\n  - Movement appears to be more strictly confined within the inner blue border.\n  - The Color 8 rectangular block moved left without apparent obstruction.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Play Area Background: Color 7 (red) Large rectangular area (Role: Main game board or playfield)\n  - Small green blob: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of 1-3 pixels (Role: Obstacle or collectible)\n  - Blue Border: Color 1 (blue) Thick rectangular frame (Role: Inner boundary/wall)\n  - Cyan Border: Color 8 (cyan) Thin rectangular frame (Role: Middle boundary/wall)\n  - Green Border: Color 3 (green) Thin rectangular frame (Role: Outermost boundary/wall)\n  - U-shaped object: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player or controllable object)\n  - Orange square: Color 4 (orange) 1x1 square (Role: Collectible or target)\n  - Red/Color 12 rectangular block: Color 12 (pinkish red) Rectangular block (Role: Interactable object / Target)\n  - Bottom UI element: Color 6 (pink) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role: UI/progress indicator)\n  - Top UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role: UI/progress indicator)\n  - Movable Cyan Block: Color 8 (cyan) 4x4 rectangular block (Role: Movable object or player element)\n  - Large Dynamic Block (Color 14): Color 14 (light pink) Rectangular block (Role: Dynamic level element / obstacle)\nSpatial structure: A grid-based or pixel-based game with a central rectangular play area surrounded by multiple layers of borders. Objects are placed discretely on this grid.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Identified new UI elements: a small purple rectangular block (Color 13) that appeared at the top, and a very thin pink bar at the bottom. These likely serve as move counters or progress indicators, and they change with actions.\n- Confirmed that objects can change color: a Color 14 block changed to Color 12, indicating interactable elements that modify the environment.\n- Confirmed object movement: a Color 8 block moved downwards, indicating dynamic game elements.\n- Discovered new objects can appear: a Color 13 block at (0, 25) and a Color 14 block at (56, 8) appeared. This suggests dynamic level generation or additional game elements being introduced.\n- Confirmed the appearance and disappearance of Color 14 blocks, and discovered they can change orientation/shape, going from (48x4) at (56,8) to (4x48) at (8,4). This strongly indicates they are dynamic, interactable level elements rather than static boundaries or always appearing in the same form. This contradicts the 'new Color 14 block at (56,8)' hypothesis from earlier and replaces it with a more nuanced understanding of dynamic Color 14 elements.\n- Discovered the Color 14 block at (56,8) 'disappeared' (was replaced/moved) and a new Color 14 block appeared at (8,4), along the left side. This suggests these blocks might be 'platforms' or dynamic walls that appear/disappear on the sides, changing the navigable space.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What is the exact function of the Color 13 (magenta) and Color 6 (pink) UI elements? Do they count moves, indicate progress, or something else? How are they affected by specific actions?\n- What happens when the Color 12 block (pinkish red) is interacted with further?\n- What is the role of the scattered green blobs across the play area? Do they block movement, or are they collectibles?\n- What happens when a Color 8 block hits another object during its movement?\n- How do the dynamic Color 14 blocks affect player movement or other game elements? Are they temporary obstacles, destructible, or part of a puzzle?\n- What is the role of the U-shaped black object and the orange square?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 can cause a Color 14 block to change color to Color 12. It can also cause a Color 8 block to move down and can cause new blocks to appear (Color 13 at (0,25) and Color 14 at (56,8)).\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 causes a Color 8 block to move left, and may cause existing Color 14 blocks to disappear and new Color 14 blocks to appear in a different location/orientation.\"\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
