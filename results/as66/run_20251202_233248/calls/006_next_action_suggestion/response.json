  "reasoning": "ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5 have not been observed at all. It is critical to get initial observations for these actions. Since ACTION1 had no effect and ACTION2 was tested recently, it is best to try a completely new, unobserved action in the current state. There's no immediate reason to perform a setup sequence before testing an entirely new action, as we don't know the effect or typical use case of ACTION3 yet. Testing ACTION3 in the current state will provide a baseline observation.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION3. This could be movement (left), interaction, or some other game mechanic.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is neutral for testing an unobserved action. The U-shaped object is centrally located and not against any obvious obstacles that would prevent lateral movement if ACTION3 is a movement action. There are also no immediate interactable objects next to the U-shaped object for testing ACTION5. Therefore, it's a good state to get a first observation for an unknown action like ACTION3."
