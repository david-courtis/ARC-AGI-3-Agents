  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been observed and therefore has the highest priority. There is no specific state requirement for testing ACTION5 that we are aware of, so we can test it directly.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe what ACTION5 does. This could be interacting with the U-shaped block (Color 0), the orange square (Color 4), or another element in the game. We will also learn if it has no effect in this general state.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is generic and doesn't seem to present any particular obstacles for testing ACTION5. The U-shaped block is centrally located, which is a good position for an initial 'interact' test. Since ACTION1 had no effect last time, we prioritize an action that has never been tested. The current board state doesn't block ACTION5, which is an unknown. The general elements (U-shaped block, orange square) are visible and could be targets for interaction."
