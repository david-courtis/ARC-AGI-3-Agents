ACTION3: \u2713 EFFECT - The action ACTION3 caused a Color 8 rectangular block at (28...\n  4. ACTION4: \u2713 EFFECT - The action ACTION4 caused a Color 8 rectangular block at (28...\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n\u26a0\ufe0f NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 7 (red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Multiple layered borders: outermost is Color 3 (green), inside that is Color 8 (cyan), then Color 1 (blue) outlining the main red play area. There's also a thin pink bar (Color 6) at the bottom and a thin magenta bar (Color 13) at the very top.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A grid-based or pixel-based game with a central rectangular play area surrounded by multiple layers of borders. Objects are placed discretely on this grid. The dynamic Color 14 blocks suggest variable boundaries/paths.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified new UI elements: a small purple rectangular block (Color 13) that appeared at the top, and a very thin pink bar at the bottom. These likely serve as move counters or progress indicators, and they change with actions.\n  - Confirmed that objects can change color: a Color 14 block changed to Color 12, indicating interactable elements that modify the environment.\n  - Confirmed object movement: a Color 8 block moved downwards, indicating dynamic game elements.\n  - Discovered new objects can appear: a Color 13 block at (0, 25) and a Color 14 block at (56, 8) appeared. This suggests dynamic level generation or additional game elements being introduced.\n  - Confirmed the appearance and disappearance of Color 14 blocks, and discovered they can change orientation/shape, going from (48x4) at (56,8) to (4x48) at (8,4). This strongly indicates they are dynamic, interactable level elements rather than static boundaries or always appearing in the same form. This contradicts the 'new Color 14 block at (56,8)' hypothesis from earlier and replaces it with a more nuanced understanding of dynamic Color 14 elements.\n  - Discovered the Color 14 block at (56,8) 'disappeared' (was replaced/moved) and a new Color 14 block appeared at (8,4), along the left side. This suggests these blocks might be 'platforms' or dynamic walls that appear/disappear on the sides, changing the navigable space.\n  - Confirmed the appearance/disappearance of Color 14 dynamic boundary blocks on the sides of the play area, consistent with them acting as dynamic platforms or changeable walls. The new position (8,56) suggests they primarily interact with the left/right edges.\n  - Confirmed the Movable Cyan Block (Color 8) can move in multiple directions (down, left, and now right), reinforcing its role as a key movable game element perhaps controlled by the player.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the outermost green border, and possibly more strictly within the inner blue border.\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the outermost green border.\n  - Movement appears to be more strictly confined within the inner blue border.\n  - The Color 8 rectangular block moved left without apparent obstruction.\n  - The Color 8 rectangular block moved right without apparent obstruction, indicating free movement within the current bounds.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (light pink)\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Play Area Background: Color 7 (red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: Main game board or playfield)\n      Evidence: It takes up the majority of the central screen space and contains other interactable objects.\n  - Green Blob: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of 1-3 pixels (Role hypothesis: Obstacle or collectible)\n      Evidence: They are scattered on the play area and their role is not yet confirmed. They do not appear to block movement of the Color 8 block currently.\n  - Blue Border: Color 1 (blue) Thick rectangular frame (Role hypothesis: Inner boundary/wall)\n      Evidence: It surrounds the main play area, suggesting it defines the innermost playable space.\n  - Cyan Border: Color 8 (cyan) Thin rectangular frame (Role hypothesis: Middle boundary/wall)\n      Evidence: It is positioned between the green and blue borders, further defining the game's boundaries.\n  - Green Border: Color 3 (green) Thin rectangular frame (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary/wall)\n      Evidence: It forms the very edge of the play-related area, suggesting it's the ultimate constraint.\n  - U-shaped Block: Color 0 (black) U-shaped block (Role hypothesis: Player or controllable object)\n      Evidence: Its central location and distinct shape often indicate a controllable entity in similar games. It hasn't moved yet.\n  - Orange Square: Color 4 (orange) 1x1 square (Role hypothesis: Collectible or target)\n      Evidence: Its small, distinct appearance suggests it could be an item to be collected or a specific target.\n  - Red/Color 12 Rectangular Block: Color 12 (pinkish red) Rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Interactable object / Target)\n      Evidence: Previous observation showed a Color 14 block changing to Color 12, implying it's a dynamic, interactive element or state change.\n  - Bottom UI Element: Color 6 (pink) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role hypothesis: UI/progress indicator)\n      Evidence: Located outside the main play area at the bottom, and changes with actions, suggesting it's a meta-game element.\n  - Top UI Element: Color 13 (magenta) Thin horizontal rectangle (Role hypothesis: UI/progress indicator)\n      Evidence: Located outside the main play area at the top, and changes with actions, suggesting it's a meta-game element.\n  - Movable Cyan Block: Color 8 (cyan) 4x4 rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Movable object or player element)\n      Evidence: Explicitly observed to move (down, left, and now right) in response to actions.\n  - Dynamic Boundary Block: Color 14 (light pink) Rectangular block (4x48 or 48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic level element / temporary obstacle / platform / changing boundary)\n      Evidence: Observed to appear, disappear, and change orientation/location (e.g., from (56,8) as 48x4 to (8,4) as 4x48, and now to (8,56) as 4x48). It defines parts of the playable area dynamically.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact function of the Color 13 (magenta) and Color 6 (pink) UI elements? Do they count moves, indicate progress, or something else? How are they affected by specific actions?\n  - What happens when the Color 12 block (pinkish red) is interacted with further?\n  - What is the role of the scattered green blobs across the play area? Do they block movement, or are they collectibles? Does the Color 8 block interact with them?\n  - What happens when a Color 8 block hits another object (e.g., the U-shaped block, orange square, or dynamic Color 14 blocks) during its movement?\n  - How do the dynamic Color 14 blocks affect player movement or other game elements? Are they temporary obstacles, destructible, or part of a puzzle?\n  - What is the role of the U-shaped black object and the orange square? Are they stationary or can they be moved or collected?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4,8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16,40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0,25): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - New Color 14 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 13 (magenta) UI element: Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION2 can cause a Color 8 block to move downwards. The exact distance is not fully determinable from a single frame.\n  - The Color 14 rectangular block that appeared at (56,8) due to ACTION2 disappeared, and a new Color 14 block appeared at a new location (8,4). This suggests these objects may not represent persistent entities across actions, or their positions are reset/regenerated.\n  - The role of the 'Color 14 rectangular block' is becoming clearer: it appears to be a dynamic, large block that can appear/disappear and change location, possibly representing a new 'zone' or element of the level that changes with actions, potentially for a new 'stage' rather than a standard movable object for the player.\n  - The action ACTION4 causes the Color 8 rectangular block to move one unit to the right.\n  - The dynamic Color 14 rectangular blocks continue to disappear from one side and reappear on the opposite side (or a different location) of the play area, consistent with the hypothesis that they are dynamic level elements that change significantly with actions.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
