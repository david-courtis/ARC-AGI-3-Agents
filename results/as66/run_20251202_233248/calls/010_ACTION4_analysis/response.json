The large dynamic Color 14 block that was at (8,4) disappeared, and a new Color 14 block appeared at (8,56).

The dynamic nature of the Color 14 blocks, which have been observed to disappear and reappear in different locations, enabled its change in position from (8,4) to (8,56). There were no other objects blocking the movement of the Color 8 block to the right.",

A Color 8 rectangular block was located at (28,24). A large dynamic Color 14 rectangular block was present at (8,4).
