1. Identified new UI elements: a small purple rectangular block (Color 13) that appeared at the top, and a very thin pink bar at the bottom. These likely serve as move counters or progress indicators, and they change with actions.
2. Confirmed that objects can change color: a Color 14 block changed to Color 12, indicating interactable elements that modify the environment.
3. Confirmed object movement: a Color 8 block moved downwards, indicating dynamic game elements.
4. Discovered new objects can appear: a Color 13 block at (0, 25) and a Color 14 block at (56, 8) appeared. This suggests dynamic level generation or additional game elements being introduced.
