Describe what happened when the action was taken\n2. Build/update a definition of what this action does\n3. Note any objects or environment features involved\n4. Track whether the action had any visible effect\n\nIMPORTANT - CURRENT UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG:\n- The environment understanding provided is TENTATIVE and may be incorrect\n- Object identifications and role hypotheses could be wrong\n- If what you observe CONTRADICTS the current understanding, note this!\n- Your observations help REFINE or CORRECT the environment model\n\nIMPORTANT - UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS:\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that count SUCCESSFUL moves\n- When an action HAS EFFECT (moves something), the move counter typically decreases\n- Changes in UI elements (e.g., red dots disappearing) indicate move consumption, NOT action effects\n- Focus on what happened in the PLAY AREA, not just UI changes\n- Running out of moves (counter reaches zero) causes game failure and reset\n\nIMPORTANT - ANIMATION LIMITATION:\n- You only see ONE frame after each action (not the full animation)\n- In sliding puzzle games, objects may slide multiple units but you only see the FIRST step\n- If an object moved, the DIRECTION is reliable but the DISTANCE may be incomplete\n- To understand full movement, you may need to observe multiple actions to see where objects settle\n\nBe precise and EVIDENCE-BASED. If you're uncertain, say so.\nMark any guesses without evidence as uncertain."
