  "reasoning": "All actions are unknown. We should test a movement action first to establish baseline movement mechanics. Moving 'UP' (ACTION1) is a good starting point to observe if it affects the player character (the black 'U' shape). The current position seems suitable for testing vertical movement as there is space above.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION1. Does the player move up? Does it change the environment? Is it blocked by the top border?",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current state shows a player character (black 'U' shape) in the lower middle of the screen, surrounded by maroon, with green patches and an orange dot. There are blue borders and thin pink/green/yellow borders around the play area. There appears to be space for vertical movement."
