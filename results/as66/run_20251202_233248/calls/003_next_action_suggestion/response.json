  "reasoning": "ACTION1 showed 'NO EFFECT' and we have no verified movement actions yet. To efficiently explore, we should test an unobserved movement action (ACTION2, ACTION3, or ACTION4) next. ACTION2 is chosen as the next unobserved action to test. There is currently no game state known to be 'bad' for testing movement, as no movement actions have been effective.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover if ACTION2 (Move DOWN) has an effect and observe its behavior. This will help us build a set of verified movement actions and break the 'NO EFFECT' cycle.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The agent appears to be in a central area. The previous attempt with ACTION1 (Move UP) resulted in 'NO EFFECT', suggesting it was either blocked or the action does nothing in this state. There are varied colors and shapes on the board which might be interactable or obstacles."
