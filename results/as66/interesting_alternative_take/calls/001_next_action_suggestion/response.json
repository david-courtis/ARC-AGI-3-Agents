  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "This is the start of the game and no verification has been done. Based on the semantic hints, ACTION1 corresponds to 'Move UP'. Looking at the image, the area directly above the presumed player avatar (the black U-shape near the bottom) appears to be open space (brown pixels). Testing movement into an open space is the most reliable way to verify a movement action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "I expect to see the black U-shape avatar change its probability distribution or pixel location to a higher row (visually moving up), confirming that ACTION1 is indeed 'Move UP'.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The board features a brown background with green abstract shapes (possibly trees or terrain obstacles). There is a black U-shaped object which is likely the player character located in the lower-left quadrant. The level is bounded by blue and green borders."
