Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)\n2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)\n3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to\ndiscover context-dependent behaviors."

Looking at the image, the area directly above the presumed player avatar (the black U-shape near the bottom) appears to be open space (brown pixels). Testing movement into an open space is the most reliable way to verify a movement action.",
