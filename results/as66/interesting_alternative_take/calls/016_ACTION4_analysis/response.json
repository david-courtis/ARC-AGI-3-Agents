  "interpretation": "The visible Pink Shield moved from the Top edge to the Right edge. This change in the 'Active Shield' position redirected the environmental gravity to the Right, causing the internal Grey Block (Color 8) to slide rightward by 12 pixels until it collided with a static obstacle (Green/Orange cluster).",

The game logic successfully moved the shield to the right wall and resolved the physics for the Grey Block, sliding it until it hit the stationary Color 4 block.",
