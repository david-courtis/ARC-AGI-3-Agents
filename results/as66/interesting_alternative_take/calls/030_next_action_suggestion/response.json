  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 (Up) is currently the least verified action (1/3 consistent). The current game state is ideal for testing this: the Active Shield is confirmed at the Bottom (from the previous ACTION2), so moving it to the Top is a guaranteed state change. Furthermore, there is visible open space directly above the payload (Grey Block) before it hits the large central green obstacle. This allows for observing the 'upward fall' trajectory and verifying collision physics against the distinct green terrain above, providing the missing confirmation needed to verify ACTION1's definition.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect the Pink Shield to move from the Bottom to the Top perimeter current. Consequently, gravity should flip to 'Up', causing the internal Grey Payload to lift off its current support and slide upwards until it collides with the underside of the large green central obstacle. This will verify ACTION1 as 'Gravity UP' and confirm collision behavior with overhead terrain.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Stage 2. The Shield is active at the bottom edge (Gravity Down). The Payload (Grey Block) is resting on a small green obstacle platform at the bottom-center. The Goal is visible to the left. The path upward is unobstructed for several grid units, terminated by a large green obstacle cluster. The path to the left (Goal) is also clear, but verifying ACTION1 first maximizes learning before potentially solving the level."
