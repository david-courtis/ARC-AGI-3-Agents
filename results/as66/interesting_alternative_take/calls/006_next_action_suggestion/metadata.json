If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: The playfield is a central square surrounded by a thick frame. The frame consists of specific wall slots on the four cardinal directions (Top, Left, Right, Bottom) and corner blocks.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Enclosed square arena with a perimeter control system (4 directional slots for the shield).\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A perimeter-control action/puzzle game. The player controls a 'Active Shield' (Pink Bar) that slides along the four walls of a square arena. The goal is likely to protect the central Black U-shape structure or manipulate bouncing objects inside the arena by presenting the correct wall face (Active vs Inactive) to incoming threats.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The Orange pixel at (17, 38) within the green cluster.\n  - The specific interaction rules between the internal 'Base' and the walls.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Active Shield / Paddle: Color 14 (pink) Vertical Rectangular Bar (4x48 pixels) (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: This object moves (teleports/rotates) to different sides of the perimeter in response to user actions. It is currently on the Right edge.\n  - Inactive Wall Segments: Color 1 (blue) Rectangular Bars (Role hypothesis: wall)\n      Evidence: These occupy the Left, Top, and Bottom slots where the Active Shield is NOT present. They appear to be the 'closed' or 'inactive' state of the wall.\n  - Base / Structure: Color 0 (black) U-shape (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Centrally located, distinct shape, static. Likely the object the shield is meant to protect or contain.\n  - Terrain Clusters: Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs (Role hypothesis: obstacle)\n      Evidence: Static objects inside the play area that likely block movement of internal entities.\n  - Orange Spec: Color 4 (orange) Single pixel/small dot (Role hypothesis: collectible)\n      Evidence: Located inside a green terrain cluster. Distinct color suggests significance.\n  - Turn/Move Indicator: Color 13 (pink) Small dash (13x1 pixels) (Role hypothesis: UI Element)\n      Evidence: Located in the top bezel/border area (outside playfield). Appeared/Changed with the action.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What happens if an entity inside the arena hits the Pink Active Shield vs the Blue Inactive Walls?\n  - Does the Orange spec (Color 4) have a function?\n  - Do the Green clusters block internal moving objects?\n  - What is the significance of the Pink UI dash at the top?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The game behaves like a fixed shooter/paddle game regarding vertical movement constraints.\n  - The Player Avatar is likely the Pink Bar (Color 14) on the perimeter, not the Black U-shape (Color 0).\n  - The Black U-shape appears to be a static structure (Base) to be defended.\n  - Movement is restricted to the perimeter (Top, Right, Bottom, Left positions).\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state!

Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration.

Given that ACTION4 moved the bar to the Right wall (consistent with 'Right' mapping), it is hypothesized that valid inputs map directly to the four cardinal directions. ACTION2 likely corresponds to 'Down', which should move the active Pink Shield from its current position on the Right wall to the Bottom wall.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the Pink Bar (Color 14) moving to the bottom edge of the arena. This would confirm the 'Absolute Positioning' control scheme hypothesis (Action1=Top, Action2=Bottom, Action3=Left, Action4=Right). If it has no effect, we will reconsider if controls are rotational or state-dependent.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The Pink Bar is actively positioned on the Right wall. The Top, Left, and Bottom walls are inactive (Blue). The game appears to be a perimeter defense puzzle where the player switches the active wall."
