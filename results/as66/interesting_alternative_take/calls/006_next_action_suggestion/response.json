  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has not been tested yet. Given that ACTION4 moved the bar to the Right wall (consistent with 'Right' mapping), it is hypothesized that valid inputs map directly to the four cardinal directions. ACTION2 likely corresponds to 'Down', which should move the active Pink Shield from its current position on the Right wall to the Bottom wall.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the Pink Bar (Color 14) moving to the bottom edge of the arena. This would confirm the 'Absolute Positioning' control scheme hypothesis (Action1=Top, Action2=Bottom, Action3=Left, Action4=Right). If it has no effect, we will reconsider if controls are rotational or state-dependent.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The Pink Bar is actively positioned on the Right wall. The Top, Left, and Bottom walls are inactive (Blue). The game appears to be a perimeter defense puzzle where the player switches the active wall."
