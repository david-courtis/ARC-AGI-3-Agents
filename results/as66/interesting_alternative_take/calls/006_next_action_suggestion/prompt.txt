=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

=== STAGE/LEVEL INFO ===
Current Stage: 1 (score: 0/254)
Actions in this stage: 3

ACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):
  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)
  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)
  ACTION3: Move LEFT (decrease column/x)
  ACTION4: Move RIGHT (increase column/x)

⚠️ NOTE: Only 4 actions are available in this game: ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move UP (No Effect)
  ACTION2: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move/Rotate the active Pink Bar (Paddle/Shield) clockwise around the perimeter (e.g., Top -> Right).

RECENT ACTION HISTORY (last 10 actions taken):
  1. ACTION1: ✗ NO EFFECT - The action resulted in no visible changes to the game state....
  2. ACTION4: ✓ EFFECT - The action caused the Pink Rectangular Bar (Color 14), previ...

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))
  Description: The playfield is a central square surrounded by a thick frame. The frame consists of specific wall slots on the four cardinal directions (Top, Left, Right, Bottom) and corner blocks.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Enclosed square arena with a perimeter control system (4 directional slots for the shield).

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A perimeter-control action/puzzle game. The player controls a 'Active Shield' (Pink Bar) that slides along the four walls of a square arena. The goal is likely to protect the central Black U-shape structure or manipulate bouncing objects inside the arena by presenting the correct wall face (Active vs Inactive) to incoming threats.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.
  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).
  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The Orange pixel at (17, 38) within the green cluster.
  - The specific interaction rules between the internal 'Base' and the walls.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).
  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Active Shield / Paddle: Color 14 (pink) Vertical Rectangular Bar (4x48 pixels) (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: This object moves (teleports/rotates) to different sides of the perimeter in response to user actions. It is currently on the Right edge.
  - Inactive Wall Segments: Color 1 (blue) Rectangular Bars (Role hypothesis: wall)
      Evidence: These occupy the Left, Top, and Bottom slots where the Active Shield is NOT present. They appear to be the 'closed' or 'inactive' state of the wall.
  - Base / Structure: Color 0 (black) U-shape (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Centrally located, distinct shape, static. Likely the object the shield is meant to protect or contain.
  - Terrain Clusters: Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs (Role hypothesis: obstacle)
      Evidence: Static objects inside the play area that likely block movement of internal entities.
  - Orange Spec: Color 4 (orange) Single pixel/small dot (Role hypothesis: collectible)
      Evidence: Located inside a green terrain cluster. Distinct color suggests significance.
  - Turn/Move Indicator: Color 13 (pink) Small dash (13x1 pixels) (Role hypothesis: UI Element)
      Evidence: Located in the top bezel/border area (outside playfield). Appeared/Changed with the action.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What happens if an entity inside the arena hits the Pink Active Shield vs the Blue Inactive Walls?
  - Does the Orange spec (Color 4) have a function?
  - Do the Green clusters block internal moving objects?
  - What is the significance of the Pink UI dash at the top?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - The game behaves like a fixed shooter/paddle game regarding vertical movement constraints.
  - The Player Avatar is likely the Pink Bar (Color 14) on the perimeter, not the Black U-shape (Color 0).
  - The Black U-shape appears to be a static structure (Base) to be defended.
  - Movement is restricted to the perimeter (Top, Right, Bottom, Left positions).

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action

Provide your structured suggestion.
