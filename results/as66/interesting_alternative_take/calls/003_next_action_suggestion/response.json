  "reasoning": "ACTION1 (UP) had no effect, consistent with the observation that the game might behave like a fixed shooter or have vertical constraints. Since verified actions are not yet available for a setup sequence, we must test the remaining unobserved actions. ACTION4 (hint: EQUAL TO RIGHT) is the strongest candidate because the black U-shape player has clear open space to its right, whereas it is located near the bottom and left boundaries, making DOWN or LEFT movement riskier to test without prior verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to see the black U-shape move to the right, confirming ACTION4 as lateral movement. This would also support the theory of a fixed-shooter mechanic if horizontal movement works while vertical failed.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player entity (black, U-shaped) is positioned in the lower-left quadrant. There is red traversable terrain to the right. The previous failure of ACTION1 suggests either a collision or a gameplay constraint on vertical movement."
