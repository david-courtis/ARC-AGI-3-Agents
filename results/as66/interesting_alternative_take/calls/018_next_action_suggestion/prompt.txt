=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

ACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):
  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)
  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)
  ACTION3: Move LEFT (decrease column/x)
  ACTION4: Move RIGHT (increase column/x)

⚠️ NOTE: Only 4 actions are available in this game: ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Gravity UP: Move Shield to Top. Applies upward force to internal objects.
  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Gravity DOWN: Move Shield to Bottom. Applies downward force to internal objects.
  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move LEFT: Relocates the Active Shield to the Left perimeter slot and applies a leftward force/movement to dynamic internal objects.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Gravity RIGHT: Move Shield to Right. Applies rightward force to internal objects.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))
  Description: Thick green outer frame. The inner perimeter contains 4 slots (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) which serve as the gravity indicators/controllers.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  64x64 Grid. Gravity-based maze. The play area is enclosed by the perimeter controller. Internal space contains static Green obstacles and a dynamic Orange payload.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A sliding-block gravity puzzle. The player controls the direction of gravity (Up, Down, Left, Right) by moving a 'Shield' around the perimeter. Changing gravity causes the internal payload (Orange block) to fall until it hits a wall. The goal is to navigate the payload around Green static obstacles into a Black U-shaped goal.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.
  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).
  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).
  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).
  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.
  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).
  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.
  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.
  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.
  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).
  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.
  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.
  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.
  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The specific pixel patterns in the top UI bar (turn counter?)
  - Interaction logic when the block enters the goal (does it disappear, change color?)

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).
  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.
  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.
  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.
  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.
  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.
  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.
  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).
  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.
  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.
  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.
  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.
  - Green terrain blocks movement.
  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.
  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles
  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles
  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain
  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls
  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles
  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls
  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.
  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Active Gravity Controller: Color 14 (pink) Rectangular Bar (currently on Right) (Role hypothesis: Gravity Source / Player Cursor)
      Evidence: Its position determines the direction of gravity. Moved to the Right edge after Action 4, causing the payload to fall Right.
  - Inactive Wall: Color 1 (blue) Rectangular Bar (Role hypothesis: Passive Boundary)
      Evidence: Occupies the Top, Left, and Bottom slots when they are not active.
  - Payload Block: Color 4 (orange) Small Square (approx 4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Moving Object)
      Evidence: Moved rightward when gravity shifted Right. Visually identified as Orange (Color 4), correcting the automated report of 'Color 8'.
  - Terrain Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular shapes (Role hypothesis: Static Wall)
      Evidence: Blocked the payload's rightward movement, causing it to stop in the middle of the play area rather than hitting the outer wall.
  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) U-shaped cup (Role hypothesis: Goal)
      Evidence: Distinctive receptacle shape located in a clear area, typical of puzzle goals.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Does the payload need to rest inside the U-shape or just touch it to win?
  - Are there hazards that can destroy the payload?
  - Is there a maximum number of moves allowed (indicated by UI at top)?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Pink Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Payload Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Green/Orange Obstacle (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - Confirmed absolute positioning: Input determines specific wall, not relative rotation.
  - Physics Constraint: Internal objects do not move if their path in the strictly new gravity direction is immediately blocked by terrain.
  - Confirmed Action 4 maps to the Right wall/Right Gravity.
  - Confirmed Color 8 (Grey Block) is a dynamic object affected by gravity (contradicting the hint that Color 4 is the only payload, or indicating multiple payload types).
  - Physics Confirmation: Objects slide continuously (multiple steps per turn) in the direction of gravity until obstructed.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action
