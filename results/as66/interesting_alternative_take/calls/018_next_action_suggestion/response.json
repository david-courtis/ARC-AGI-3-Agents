  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "The last action was ACTION4 (Gravity/Shield Right), which pushed the payload to the right side of the board against an obstacle. Testing ACTION3 (Left) now provides the maximum potential for observable change, as it applies an opposing force that should pull the payload away from the wall/obstacle it is currently resting against. This will help verify ACTION3 (currently 1/3 consistent) and move the payload towards the Black Goal U-shape located on the left side of the arena.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify that ACTION3 reliably moves the Shield to the Left slot and applies leftward gravity to the internal payload. We also aim to learn about the collision geometry of the large Green obstacle on the left side by seeing if the payload hits it or slides past it.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The Pink Shield is verified to be on the Right perimeter (Action 4). The Orange Payload is located in the right-center area, blocked from further rightward movement by a Green obstacle. The Goal (Black U-shape) is visible in the lower-left quadrant. The path to the left is partially obstructed by a large Green cluster, but offers space for movement."
