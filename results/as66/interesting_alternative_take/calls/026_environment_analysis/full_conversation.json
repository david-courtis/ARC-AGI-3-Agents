    "content": "You are an environment analyst studying an unknown game world.\n\nYour SOLE FOCUS is understanding the ENVIRONMENT - not the actions.\n\nCRITICAL: YOUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG!\n- Previous object identifications and role hypotheses are TENTATIVE and may need correction\n- If action results contradict your current understanding, UPDATE IT\n- You can and SHOULD replace incorrect objects/roles with better interpretations\n- Every analysis is an opportunity to REFINE or CORRECT the environment model\n\nYou must discover and document:\n1. BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

Consequently\nEvidence Status: STATE CHANGE OBSERVED - Use this as evidence!\n\nRECENT CHANGES OBSERVED (THIS IS EVIDENCE!):\nTotal: 432 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (112), upper_right_playarea (112), lower_left_playarea (96), lower_right_playarea (96), top_ui (16) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [4-59]\n\nObject-level changes: APPEARED: 3 objects\n  + Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24)\n  + Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40)\n  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56)\nDISAPPEARED: 1 objects\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)\nMOVED: 1 objects\n  ~ Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 44) moved left\n\n\n=== ACTION ANALYSIS INSIGHTS (from previous LLM analysis of this action) ===\nFull Interpretation: The action moved the Active Pink Shield from the Left perimeter to the Right perimeter. Consequently, the gravity direction switched to RIGHT. The Grey Payload Block (Color 11) slid immediately to the right, traversing the open space until it collided with the static Green Obstacle on the right side of the arena, where it came to rest.\nWhy This Outcome: The Pink Shield was positioned on the Left. The input ACTION4 (Right) moved it to the Right slot. There was open space to the right of the payload block, allowing it to slide freely under the new gravitational force until obstructed by terrain.\nEnvironment Updates Discovered:\n  - Confirmed: The payload object in Stage 2 is Color 11 (Grey/Light Blue), whereas it was Color 4 (Orange) in Stage 1.\n  - Confirmed: Physics allows objects to slide across the entire width of the arena in a single turn if unobstructed.\nObjects Involved: Pink Shield (Color 14), Grey Payload Block (Color 11), Green Obstacles (Color 3), Right Perimeter\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above insights were discovered by analyzing the action's effect.\nUse these insights to UPDATE your environment understanding!\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING (MAY BE WRONG - UPDATE IF NEEDED):\nBackground: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\nBorder: Yes (Color 3 (green)) - Thick green outer frame (1 pixel wide green, then blue/pink track)\nInternal walls/obstacles:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.\n  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries\n  - Color 3 (green) central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) top-left small cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) bottom-right small cluster\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as walls\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.\n  - Green terrain blocks movement.\n  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.\n  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.\n  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.\n  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - Diagonal movement is not observed.\n  - Payload blocked by Green obstacles.\n  - Payload currently pinned against the right side of the central obstacle due to Leftward gravity.\n  - Perimeter walls block exit.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Payload Block: Grey/Silver (possibly Color 4 or 8 in logs) Small Square (approx 4x4) (Role: Player Character / Moveable Object)\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) C-shaped / U-shaped cup (Role: Goal)\n  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Vertical Bar (Left side) (Role: Gravity Controller)\n  - Obstacle Cluster: Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs (Role: Static Terrain)\nSpatial structure: Enclosed arena with a central obstacle maze. Perimeter track controls gravity direction.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n- The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n- Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n- Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n- The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n- CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n- SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n- DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n- CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n- Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n- Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n- Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n- Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n- Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n- Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n- Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n- Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n- Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n- STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n- INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n- GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n- PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- Is the payload color consistent across stages (logs say Color 4, visuals show Grey/Color 5/8)?\n- Do red background pixels adjacent to walls traverse differently?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"Gravity UP: Move Shield to Top. Applies upward force to internal objects.\"\n  ACTION2: \"Gravity DOWN: Move Shield to Bottom. Applies downward force to internal objects.\"\n  ACTION3: \"Gravity LEFT: Move Shield to Left Perimeter. Applies leftward force to internal payload.\"\n  ACTION4: \"Gravity RIGHT: Move Shield to Right. Applies rightward force to internal objects.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n7. UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS: Which colors or sections of the grid have NOT been thoroughly analyzed yet? List specific colors or regions that need more investigation.\n8. DOMAIN DESCRIPTION: Provide a high-level conceptual description of the game. What type of game is this (puzzle, navigation, sokoban-like, etc.)? What appears to be the goal? How do the mechanics work together at a conceptual level?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
