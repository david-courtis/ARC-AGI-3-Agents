You are a game analyst learning how an unknown game works.

You observe state transitions (before/after frames) and analyze what actions do.
You have NO prior knowledge of this game - base all conclusions on observed evidence only.

Your job is to:
1. Describe what happened when the action was taken
2. Build/update a definition of what this action does
3. Note any objects or environment features involved
4. Track whether the action had any visible effect

IMPORTANT - CURRENT UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG:
- The environment understanding provided is TENTATIVE and may be incorrect
- Object identifications and role hypotheses could be wrong
- If what you observe CONTRADICTS the current understanding, note this!
- Your observations help REFINE or CORRECT the environment model

IMPORTANT - UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS:
- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that count successful moves
- When an action HAS EFFECT (moves something), the move counter typically decreases
- Changes in UI elements (e.g., red dots disappearing) indicate move consumption, NOT action effects
- Focus on what happened in the PLAY AREA, not just UI changes
- Grid boundaries may result in looping interactions.
- Running out of moves (counter reaches zero) causes game failure and reset

Be precise and EVIDENCE-BASED. If you're uncertain, say so.
Mark any guesses without evidence as uncertain.

[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: The player is positioned at the bottom of a bounded playfield (Color 15/F background), facing upward towards green shape clusters (Color 3). The environment is static.
Changes: No changes detected. The action had no visible effect on the game state.
Objects changed: No object-level changes detected

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] NO EFFECT

Interpretation: The action resulted in no visible changes to the game state. The player character (black U-shape at the bottom) remained in its position at row 53, and no projectiles or movement occurred. Given the game's visual similarity to a fixed shooter (e.g., Space Invaders) or paddle game (Avatar at bottom, enemies/obstacles above), vertical movement is likely restricted or disabled by the game rules.
Why this outcome: The game layout resembles a fixed-axis shooter or arcade game where the player is constrained to the bottom rows (horizontal movement only). Consequently, an input corresponding to 'Move UP' is ignored by the game logic or treated as a null action.
Consistent: None

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION4

Context: The game appears to be a perimeter-defense or paddle game where the player controls a Pink Bar (Color 14) acting as a shield or reflector on the borders. The central playfield contains a static Black U-shape (Base) and Green enemies.
Changes: Total: 397 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_right_playarea (192), upper_left_playarea (96), lower_right_playarea (96), top_ui (13) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [8-59]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 2 objects
  + Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25)
  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56)
COLOR CHANGED: 1 objects
  * Object at (4, 8): color 14 -> 12

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action caused the Pink Rectangular Bar (Color 14), previously located at the top edge of the playfield, to disappear and reappear along the right edge (effectively rotating the 'active wall' or 'shield' 90 degrees clockwise). The Black U-shape (Color 0) and Green clusters (Color 3) remained static and did not move. A small Pink indicator (Color 13) also appeared in the top UI bezel.
Why this outcome: The Pink Bar was at the top position. The 'Right' input caused it to shift to the next clockwise position (Right edge). The Black U-shape did not respond to movement inputs, suggesting it is a static base or target.
Consistent: False

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION2

Context: The player controls a shield on the perimeter of a square arena. The input directly moved the shield to the bottom side. Simultaneously, the game 'ticked', advancing the position of a falling object inside the arena.
Changes: Total: 428 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (192), upper_right_playarea (128), lower_left_playarea (96), top_ui (12) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-59], cols [8-59]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 1 objects
  + Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8)
DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56)
MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40) moved down

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible Pink Shield (Player) moved from the Right edge of the arena to the Bottom edge. An internal Grey Block (Color 8) moved downwards by 12 pixels. The Action counter/UI at the top updated.
Why this outcome: The Player Control (Pink Shield) was positioned on the Right edge. The 'Down' input (ACTION2) caused the shield to move to the Bottom edge, consistent with a directional control scheme where inputs map to the corresponding perimeter interaction slot. The previous location (Right) reverted to an Inactive Wall (Blue).
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION3

Context: The shield is now on the Left wall. The Grey Block has moved left and is resting against a central obstacle structure.
Changes: Total: 429 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_left_playarea (192), upper_left_playarea (112), lower_right_playarea (96), upper_right_playarea (16), top_ui (13) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-59], cols [4-55]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 1 objects
  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)
DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8)
MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 40) moved left

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action moved the visible Pink Shield (Player) from the Bottom perimeter to the Left perimeter. Simultaneously, the internal Grey Block (Color 8) moved horizontally to the left by 12 pixels (3 steps of 4 pixels each) until it encountered an obstacle (Green/Orange cluster). This strongly suggests that the player's directional input controls both the specific wall the Shield occupies AND the direction of 'gravity' or force applied to the internal object (e.g., Shield Left = Gravity Left).
Why this outcome: The 'Left' input was issued while the Shield was at the Bottom. The internal Grey Block had open space to its left. The game logic processed the input by moving the Shield to the Left and sliding the Block leftward until it hit a Green/Orange obstacle.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: The player is navigating a payload through a maze using directional gravity. The Shield moved from Left -> Top. The payload remained pinned under an obstacle.
Changes: Total: 396 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (192), upper_right_playarea (96), lower_left_playarea (96), top_ui (12) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [4-56]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 1 objects
  + Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8)
DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action activated the 'Top' perimeter shield, moving the visible Pink Bar from the Left edge to the Top edge. This corresponds to setting the gravitational pull to 'Up'. However, the internal Grey Block (payload) did not move upwards, likely because it is positioned directly beneath an overhang of the green obstacle structure, preventing vertical movement in that direction.
Why this outcome: The Active Shield was previously on the Left. ACTION1 (Up) successfully moved it to the Top. The internal Grey Block (Color 8) was resting against the left obstacle. When gravity shifted to UP, the block's path was obstructed by the 'branches' of the green tree-like structure directly above it (visible in the image, though the low-res ASCII grid text suggests empty space 'F', the complex shape likely has a collision map blocking the path). Thus, no physics movement was resolved.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION4

Context: Shield moves Top -> Right. Gravity shifts Right. Payload slides Right.
Changes: Total: 429 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_right_playarea (208), upper_left_playarea (112), lower_right_playarea (96), top_ui (13) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [0-62]

  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56)
DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8)
MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24) moved right

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible Pink Shield moved from the Top edge to the Right edge. This change in the 'Active Shield' position redirected the environmental gravity to the Right, causing the internal Grey Block (Color 8) to slide rightward by 12 pixels until it collided with a static obstacle (Green/Orange cluster).
Why this outcome: The Pink Shield was at the Top. The player input 'Action 4' (Right). The internal Grey Block had open space to its right. The game logic successfully moved the shield to the right wall and resolved the physics for the Grey Block, sliding it until it hit the stationary Color 4 block.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION3

Context: The player switched gravity from Right to Left. The payload was positioned in an open lane, allowing it to traverse a significant distance leftward before hitting a wall.
Changes: Total: 428 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (112), upper_right_playarea (112), lower_left_playarea (96), lower_right_playarea (96), top_ui (7), left_edge (3), right_edge (2) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [0-63]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 1 objects

DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56)
MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 40) moved left

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action moved the Active Pink Shield from the Right perimeter to the Left perimeter. This changed the gravity direction to 'Left'. Consequently, the Orange Payload block slid horizontally to the left across the open space until it collided with the vertical edge of the central Green obstacle structure, where it stopped.
Why this outcome: The Pink Shield was previously on the Right. The 'Left' input (ACTION3) successfully relocated it to the Left slot. The internal payload had empty space to its left, allowing it to slide freely under the new gravitational force until obstructed by the static Green terrain.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION2

Context: Puzzle solve state: The payload fell into the goal, clearing the level and loading a new map.
Changes: Total: 994 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_right_playarea (272), upper_left_playarea (256), lower_right_playarea (224), lower_left_playarea (160), top_ui (70), bottom_ui (7), left_edge (3), right_edge (2) Changes in both play area and UI elements.

COLOR CHANGED: 1 objects
  * Object at (28, 36): color 4 -> 11

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The player executed ACTION2 (Down). This caused the active gravity direction to switch to 'Down'. The Payload Block (Orange/Color 4), which was positioned directly above the Black Goal Receptacle (Color 0), fell downwards into the goal. Upon entering the goal, the level was completed, triggering a transition to a new stage (Stage 3 or next puzzle) with a completely different layout (Image 6).
Why this outcome: The Payload Block was aligned vertically with the Goal Receptacle. There were no obstacles between the block and the goal in the downward direction. Applying downward gravity (Action 2) allowed the block to fall freely into the target, satisfying the win condition.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION4

Context: The payload block started resting against the right side of the central obstacle (due to previous Left gravity). Changing gravity to Right caused it to detach and slide across the gap.
Changes: Total: 432 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (112), upper_right_playarea (112), lower_left_playarea (96), lower_right_playarea (96), top_ui (16) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [4-59]

  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)
MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 44) moved left

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action moved the Active Pink Shield from the Left perimeter to the Right perimeter. Consequently, the gravity direction switched to RIGHT. The Grey Payload Block (Color 11) slid immediately to the right, traversing the open space until it collided with the static Green Obstacle on the right side of the arena, where it came to rest.
Why this outcome: The Pink Shield was positioned on the Left. The input ACTION4 (Right) moved it to the Right slot. There was open space to the right of the payload block, allowing it to slide freely under the new gravitational force until obstructed by terrain.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION2

Context: Shield moved Right -> Bottom. Gravity Shifted Right -> Down. Payload fell until hitting a floor.
Changes: Total: 431 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (192), lower_left_playarea (112), upper_right_playarea (96), upper_left_playarea (16), top_ui (15) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-59], cols [8-59]

MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28) moved down

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The player executed ACTION2 (Down). This caused the visible Pink Shield to move from the Right perimeter to the Bottom perimeter, changing the gravity direction to 'Down'. The internal Grey Payload (Color 11), previously resting against the side of a central obstacle, fell vertically downwards through open space. It traveled approximately 8 pixels before landing on top of a lower Green Obstacle (Color 3) and coming to a stop.
Why this outcome: The Pink Shield (Player) was previously on the Right edge. The input 'Down' moved it to the Bottom slot. Vertical space below the payload was initially clear (Color 9 background), allowing movement. A Green obstacle (Color 3) was located 12 pixels below the payload, acting as a floor/stopper.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: The payload was positioned with a clear vertical path to the top edge. The move to Top Gravity accelerated it towards the Active Shield.
Changes: Total: 432 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_left_playarea (128), upper_left_playarea (96), upper_right_playarea (96), lower_right_playarea (96), top_ui (16) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-59], cols [8-55]

MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (40, 28) moved down

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action moved the Active Pink Shield to the Top perimeter, setting the gravity direction to UP. The Grey Payload (Color 11) 'fell' upwards. Critically, instead of stopping when it reached the Top edge (where the Active Shield was located), it passed through the boundary and wrapped around to the Bottom of the playfield (Screen Wrap). It continued moving upwards from the bottom edge until it collided with the underside of a central Green Obstacle, where it came to rest.
Why this outcome: The path between the payload and the Top Shield was completely unobstructed. Previous attempts to move UP were blocked by obstacles immediately above the payload. The 'Active Shield' acts as a hole in the perimeter wall, enabling the screen-wrap mechanic observed here.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION3

Context: Stage 2. Shield starts at Top. Payload is on row 48. Gravity is switched to Left.
Changes: Total: 432 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (192), lower_left_playarea (112), upper_right_playarea (96), top_ui (16), lower_right_playarea (16) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [0-62]

DISAPPEARED: 2 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8)
  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The player executed ACTION3 (Left). This moved the Active Pink Shield from the Top perimeter slot to the Left perimeter slot, switching the gravity direction to 'Left'. The internal Grey Payload (Color 11) slid leftward across the floor. Upon reaching the Left perimeter (now occupied by the Active Shield), it utilized the Shield as a 'Screen Wrap Portal', passing through the boundary and reappearing on the Right edge of the playfield. It continued moving leftward from the right edge until it collided with a small Green Obstacle (Color 3) at row 48, where it came to rest.
Why this outcome: The Active Shield was moved to the Left, creating an open 'gate' in the perimeter wall. The payload's path to the left was unobstructed until the wall. Because the wall was 'Active' (Pink), the collision logic triggered a screen wrap instead of a stop. The payload wrapped to the opposite side (Right) and continued moving under the leftward gravity until hitting a static internal obstacle.
Consistent: True

Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

=== STAGE/LEVEL INFO ===
Current Stage: 2 (score: 1/254)
Actions in this stage: 5

Stage History:
  Stage 1: started at action 0, score=0
  Stage 2: started at action 8, score=1

SEMANTIC HINT: ACTION4 is expected to mean "Move RIGHT (increase column/x)" (but verify through observation!)

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"Gravity RIGHT: Move Shield to Right. Applies rightward force to internal objects."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS FOR THIS ACTION (3 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game appears to be a perimeter-defense or paddle game where the player controls a Pink Bar (Color 14) acting as a shield or reflector on the borders. The central playfield contains a static Black U-shape (Base) and Green enemies.
      Interpretation: The action caused the Pink Rectangular Bar (Color 14), previously located at the top edge of the playfield, to disappear and reappear along the right edge (effectively rotating the 'active wall' or 'shield' 90 degrees clockwise). The Black U-shape (Color 0) and Green clusters (Color 3) remained static and did not move. A small Pink indicator (Color 13) also appeared in the top UI bezel.
  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: Shield moves Top -> Right. Gravity shifts Right. Payload slides Right.
      Interpretation: The visible Pink Shield moved from the Top edge to the Right edge. This change in the 'Active Shield' position redirected the environmental gravity to the Right, causing the internal Grey Block (Color 8) to slide rightward by 12 pixels until it collided with a static obstacle (Green/Orange cluster).
  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The payload block started resting against the right side of the central obstacle (due to previous Left gravity). Changing gravity to Right caused it to detach and slide across the gap.
      Interpretation: The action moved the Active Pink Shield from the Left perimeter to the Right perimeter. Consequently, the gravity direction switched to RIGHT. The Grey Payload Block (Color 11) slid immediately to the right, traversing the open space until it collided with the static Green Obstacle on the right side of the arena, where it came to rest.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))
  Description: Thick Green (Color 3) outer frame (approx 4px) surrounding the play area. Just inside this frame are 4 'slots' for the perimeter walls/shields.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  2D Grid with Conditional Toroidal Topology. The grid wraps locally in the direction of the Active Shield, but behaves as a bounded box in other directions.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A sliding-block puzzle game featuring 'Rotational Gravity' and 'Screen Wrapping'. The player moves a 'Gravity Shield' around the perimeter. This shield serves two purposes: determining the direction of gravity (pulling the payload) and acting as a portal that allows the payload to wrap around the screen. Inactive sides act as solid walls. The goal is to slide a payload block into a specific target receptacle by manipulating gravity and using obstacles to align the path.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.
  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).
  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).
  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).
  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.
  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).
  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.
  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.
  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.
  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).
  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.
  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.
  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.
  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.
  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.
  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.
  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.
  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.
  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).
  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.
  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.
  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).
  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).
  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.
  - Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.
  - Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.
  - Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.
  - Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.
  - CONFIRMED WRAP MECHANIC: The 'Active Shield' (Pink) functions as a portal. Objects do not stop at the shield; they pass through and wrap to the opposite side of the screen.
  - TOROIDAL TOPOLOGY: The playfield effectively becomes a cylinder in the direction of the active gravity.
  - NON-EUCLIDEAN MOVEMENT: 'Gravity Up' can result in the object appearing lower on the screen due to wrapping from Top to Bottom.
  - GRAVITY CONFIRMATION: Gravity pulls towards the Pink Shield. (Shield Top = Gravity Up).
  - CONFIRMED SCREEN WRAPPING: The Pink Shield allows the payload to exit the screen and re-enter from the opposite side. Evidence: Coordinate change from (48, 28) to (48, 48) under Left Gravity is only possible via a wrap.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - Properties of the Black Goal walls (are they solid?)
  - Exact behavior if a wrapped object reappears inside an obstacle (likely impossible by level design)

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Grey Payload: Color 11 (grey) 4x4 pixel square (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Projectile)
      Evidence: Moves in response to gravity changes; interacts with walls and goals. Wrapped around screen in latest turn.
  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) 48x4 (or 4x48) pixel bar (Role hypothesis: Gravity Source & Portal)
      Evidence: Determines gravity direction. Objects pass THROUGH it to wrap to the other side of the screen (observed in Action 3).
  - Inactive Wall: Color 1 (blue) 48x4 (or 4x48) pixel bar (Role hypothesis: Solid Boundary)
      Evidence: Located at perimeter slots not occupied by the shield. Prevents movement/wrapping.
  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) C-shaped cup opening Right (Role hypothesis: Goal)
      Evidence: Distinct shape and color, typical of puzzle goals. Orientation suggests entry vector.
  - Internal Obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregular blocks (Role hypothesis: Static Terrain)
      Evidence: Blocks payload movement. Payload is currently resting against the right face of a green block after leftward gravity.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Does the payload stop immediately upon entering the goal, or must it hit the back wall of the goal?
  - Is the goal 'solid' from the outside (e.g. hitting the top/bottom/left of the black 'C' shape)?
  - Does wrapping preserve exact intercept coordinates or is there a shift?

Recent Observations:
  - Inactive Blue borders function as solid walls that prevent wrapping.
  - Objects wrap to the opposite edge and continue moving in the direction of gravity until blocked by an internal obstacle.
  - CONFIRMED: The 'Active Shield' permits horizontal screen wrapping (Left <-> Right) in addition to vertical wrapping.
  - The payload maintains its row (Y-coordinate) during a horizontal wrap.
  - Internal obstacles (Color 3) effectively catch wrapped objects.

I'm showing you a SEQUENCE of 12 LABELED images:
1. IMAGE 1: Frame BEFORE the action
2-12. IMAGEs 2-12: Animation frames showing the motion step by step

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Analyze ALL animation frames to understand the FULL motion path!
Objects may move multiple tiles - track their path through each frame.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!
2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects
3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context
4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)
5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect
6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.
7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.

Analyze what happened and provide your structured analysis.
