  "interpretation": "The action moved the Active Pink Shield to the Right perimeter, setting the gravity direction to RIGHT. The Grey Payload (Color 11) moved rightward. Upon reaching the Right edge (occupied by the Active Shield), it wrapped around the screen, reappearing on the Left edge. It continued sliding rightward from the left side until it collided with a static internal obstacle (Color 4/Color 3 structure) at column 36, where it came to rest.",
  "update_definition": false,
  "new_definition": null,
  "is_consistent_with_previous": true,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The Active Shield on the Right perimeter acted as a portal, allowing the payload to traverse the screen boundary (Screen Wrap). The payload's path after the wrap was eventually blocked by an internal obstacle, stopping it in a position horizontally aligned with the goal but on the opposite side of the wrap loop.",
  "objects_involved": [
    "Active Gravity Shield (Pink/Color 14)",
    "Grey Payload Block (Color 11)",

  "context_description": "Stage 2. Payload wrapped from Right -> Left and is now resting against an obstacle at (48, 36). The Black Goal is located to its left at roughly the same row.",
  "had_effect": true,

  "environment_updates": [
    "Confirmation: The Active Shield allows Screen Wrapping in the direction of gravity.",
    "Strategy: The game uses obstacles as 'backstops' to align the payload. This move likely positioned the payload to slide left directly into the goal on the next turn."
