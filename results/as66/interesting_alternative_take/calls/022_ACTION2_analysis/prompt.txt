=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game analyst learning how an unknown game works.

You observe state transitions (before/after frames) and analyze what actions do.
You have NO prior knowledge of this game - base all conclusions on observed evidence only.

Your job is to:
1. Describe what happened when the action was taken
2. Build/update a definition of what this action does
3. Note any objects or environment features involved
4. Track whether the action had any visible effect

IMPORTANT - CURRENT UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG:
- The environment understanding provided is TENTATIVE and may be incorrect
- Object identifications and role hypotheses could be wrong
- If what you observe CONTRADICTS the current understanding, note this!
- Your observations help REFINE or CORRECT the environment model

IMPORTANT - UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS:
- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that count successful moves
- When an action HAS EFFECT (moves something), the move counter typically decreases
- Changes in UI elements (e.g., red dots disappearing) indicate move consumption, NOT action effects
- Focus on what happened in the PLAY AREA, not just UI changes
- Grid boundaries may result in looping interactions.
- Running out of moves (counter reaches zero) causes game failure and reset

Be precise and EVIDENCE-BASED. If you're uncertain, say so.
Mark any guesses without evidence as uncertain.

[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: The player is positioned at the bottom of a bounded playfield (Color 15/F background), facing upward towards green shape clusters (Color 3). The environment is static.
Changes: No changes detected. The action had no visible effect on the game state.
Objects changed: No object-level changes detected

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] NO EFFECT

Interpretation: The action resulted in no visible changes to the game state. The player character (black U-shape at the bottom) remained in its position at row 53, and no projectiles or movement occurred. Given the game's visual similarity to a fixed shooter (e.g., Space Invaders) or paddle game (Avatar at bottom, enemies/obstacles above), vertical movement is likely restricted or disabled by the game rules.
Why this outcome: The game layout resembles a fixed-axis shooter or arcade game where the player is constrained to the bottom rows (horizontal movement only). Consequently, an input corresponding to 'Move UP' is ignored by the game logic or treated as a null action.
Consistent: None

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION4

Context: The game appears to be a perimeter-defense or paddle game where the player controls a Pink Bar (Color 14) acting as a shield or reflector on the borders. The central playfield contains a static Black U-shape (Base) and Green enemies.
Changes: Total: 397 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_right_playarea (192), upper_left_playarea (96), lower_right_playarea (96), top_ui (13) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [8-59]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 2 objects
  + Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25)
  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56)
COLOR CHANGED: 1 objects
  * Object at (4, 8): color 14 -> 12

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action caused the Pink Rectangular Bar (Color 14), previously located at the top edge of the playfield, to disappear and reappear along the right edge (effectively rotating the 'active wall' or 'shield' 90 degrees clockwise). The Black U-shape (Color 0) and Green clusters (Color 3) remained static and did not move. A small Pink indicator (Color 13) also appeared in the top UI bezel.
Why this outcome: The Pink Bar was at the top position. The 'Right' input caused it to shift to the next clockwise position (Right edge). The Black U-shape did not respond to movement inputs, suggesting it is a static base or target.
Consistent: False

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION2

Context: The player controls a shield on the perimeter of a square arena. The input directly moved the shield to the bottom side. Simultaneously, the game 'ticked', advancing the position of a falling object inside the arena.
Changes: Total: 428 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_right_playarea (192), upper_right_playarea (128), lower_left_playarea (96), top_ui (12) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-59], cols [8-59]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 1 objects
  + Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8)
DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56)
MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40) moved down

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible Pink Shield (Player) moved from the Right edge of the arena to the Bottom edge. An internal Grey Block (Color 8) moved downwards by 12 pixels. The Action counter/UI at the top updated.
Why this outcome: The Player Control (Pink Shield) was positioned on the Right edge. The 'Down' input (ACTION2) caused the shield to move to the Bottom edge, consistent with a directional control scheme where inputs map to the corresponding perimeter interaction slot. The previous location (Right) reverted to an Inactive Wall (Blue).
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION3

Context: The shield is now on the Left wall. The Grey Block has moved left and is resting against a central obstacle structure.
Changes: Total: 429 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_left_playarea (192), upper_left_playarea (112), lower_right_playarea (96), upper_right_playarea (16), top_ui (13) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-59], cols [4-55]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 1 objects
  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)
DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8)
MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 40) moved left

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action moved the visible Pink Shield (Player) from the Bottom perimeter to the Left perimeter. Simultaneously, the internal Grey Block (Color 8) moved horizontally to the left by 12 pixels (3 steps of 4 pixels each) until it encountered an obstacle (Green/Orange cluster). This strongly suggests that the player's directional input controls both the specific wall the Shield occupies AND the direction of 'gravity' or force applied to the internal object (e.g., Shield Left = Gravity Left).
Why this outcome: The 'Left' input was issued while the Shield was at the Bottom. The internal Grey Block had open space to its left. The game logic processed the input by moving the Shield to the Left and sliding the Block leftward until it hit a Green/Orange obstacle.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION1

Context: The player is navigating a payload through a maze using directional gravity. The Shield moved from Left -> Top. The payload remained pinned under an obstacle.
Changes: Total: 396 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (192), upper_right_playarea (96), lower_left_playarea (96), top_ui (12) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [4-56]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 1 objects
  + Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8)
DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action activated the 'Top' perimeter shield, moving the visible Pink Bar from the Left edge to the Top edge. This corresponds to setting the gravitational pull to 'Up'. However, the internal Grey Block (payload) did not move upwards, likely because it is positioned directly beneath an overhang of the green obstacle structure, preventing vertical movement in that direction.
Why this outcome: The Active Shield was previously on the Left. ACTION1 (Up) successfully moved it to the Top. The internal Grey Block (Color 8) was resting against the left obstacle. When gravity shifted to UP, the block's path was obstructed by the 'branches' of the green tree-like structure directly above it (visible in the image, though the low-res ASCII grid text suggests empty space 'F', the complex shape likely has a collision map blocking the path). Thus, no physics movement was resolved.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION4

Context: Shield moves Top -> Right. Gravity shifts Right. Payload slides Right.
Changes: Total: 429 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_right_playarea (208), upper_left_playarea (112), lower_right_playarea (96), top_ui (13) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [0-62]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 1 objects
  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56)
DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8)
MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24) moved right

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The visible Pink Shield moved from the Top edge to the Right edge. This change in the 'Active Shield' position redirected the environmental gravity to the Right, causing the internal Grey Block (Color 8) to slide rightward by 12 pixels until it collided with a static obstacle (Green/Orange cluster).
Why this outcome: The Pink Shield was at the Top. The player input 'Action 4' (Right). The internal Grey Block had open space to its right. The game logic successfully moved the shield to the right wall and resolved the physics for the Grey Block, sliding it until it hit the stationary Color 4 block.
Consistent: True

=== USER ===
[Previous Analysis] Action: ACTION3

Context: The player switched gravity from Right to Left. The payload was positioned in an open lane, allowing it to traverse a significant distance leftward before hitting a wall.
Changes: Total: 428 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (112), upper_right_playarea (112), lower_left_playarea (96), lower_right_playarea (96), top_ui (7), left_edge (3), right_edge (2) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [0-63]
Objects changed: APPEARED: 1 objects
  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)
DISAPPEARED: 1 objects
  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56)
MOVED: 1 objects
  ~ Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 40) moved left

=== ASSISTANT ===
[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT

Interpretation: The action moved the Active Pink Shield from the Right perimeter to the Left perimeter. This changed the gravity direction to 'Left'. Consequently, the Orange Payload block slid horizontally to the left across the open space until it collided with the vertical edge of the central Green obstacle structure, where it stopped.
Why this outcome: The Pink Shield was previously on the Right. The 'Left' input (ACTION3) successfully relocated it to the Left slot. The internal payload had empty space to its left, allowing it to slide freely under the new gravitational force until obstructed by the static Green terrain.
Consistent: True

=== STAGE/LEVEL INFO ===
Current Stage: 2 (score: 1/254)
Actions in this stage: 0

⚠️  **JUST ENTERED NEW STAGE** ⚠️
WARNING: This new stage may introduce:
  - New object types or colors not seen before
  - Different mechanics or rules
  - New movement constraints or interactions
  - Modified behavior for existing actions
IMPORTANT: Re-evaluate your understanding of the environment!
Previous assumptions may no longer be valid.

Stage History:
  Stage 1: started at action 0, score=0
  Stage 2: started at action 8, score=1

SEMANTIC HINT: ACTION2 is expected to mean "Move DOWN (increase row/y)" (but verify through observation!)

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION2:
"Gravity DOWN: Move Shield to Bottom. Applies downward force to internal objects."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS FOR THIS ACTION (1 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (consistent)
      Context: The player controls a shield on the perimeter of a square arena. The input directly moved the shield to the bottom side. Simultaneously, the game 'ticked', advancing the position of a falling object inside the arena.
      Interpretation: The visible Pink Shield (Player) moved from the Right edge of the arena to the Bottom edge. An internal Grey Block (Color 8) moved downwards by 12 pixels. The Action counter/UI at the top updated.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))
  Description: A thick green outer frame enclosing the play area. Inside this frame is a secondary track containing the 4 directional slots for the shield/gravity controller.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  64x64 Grid containing a gravity-based maze. The play area is bounded by a controller track. Inside, green obstacles form a maze that the orange block must navigate through gravity manipulation.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A gravity-manipulation puzzle where the player controls the direction of 'down' by moving a cursor (Shield) around the perimeter of the screen. The goal is to guide a sliding block (Orange) through a maze of static obstacles (Green) into a target receptacle (Black U-shape). The mechanics mimic 'rotational gravity' or 'sliding block' puzzles.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.
  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).
  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).
  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).
  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.
  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).
  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.
  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.
  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.
  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).
  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.
  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.
  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.
  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.
  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.
  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.
  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The distinct yellow line at the bottom of the screen (color not standard in palette descriptions).
  - The precise interaction logic with the goal (Color 0 U-shape).

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).
  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.
  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.
  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.
  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.
  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.
  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.
  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).
  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.
  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.
  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.
  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.
  - Green terrain blocks movement.
  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.
  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.
  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.
  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.
  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.
  - Diagonal movement is not observed.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles
  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles
  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain
  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls
  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles
  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls
  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.
  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.
  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain
  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Rectangular Bar (vertical) (Role hypothesis: Gravity Controller)
      Evidence: Its position dictates the direction of gravity. When on the Left (current), the payload slides Left. It moves between perimeter slots.
  - Inactive Shield Slot: Color 1 (blue) Rectangular Bar (Role hypothesis: Passive Boundary)
      Evidence: Fills the perimeter slots not occupied by the Active Shield. Blocks movement out of bounds.
  - Payload Block: Color 4 (orange) Small Square (approx 4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Moving Object)
      Evidence: This object moves in response to the Shield's position. It just slid to the left when the Shield moved to the Left. (Note: Automated logs incorrectly identify this as Color 8, but visual evidence confirms Orange/Color 4).
  - Terrain Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters (Role hypothesis: Static Wall)
      Evidence: The Payload Block stopped moving precisely when it collided with the vertical edge of this green cluster.
  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) U-shape / Cup (Role hypothesis: Goal)
      Evidence: A distinct receptacle shape located in the lower area, distinguished from the solid green walls.
  - Progress/Info Bar: Yellow Line (Role hypothesis: UI Element)
      Evidence: A single colored line across the very bottom of the view, likely indicated status or boundary.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Does the payload need to settle INSIDE the 'cup' of importance (requiring Down gravity to enter) or just touch it?
  - What is the Yellow bar at the bottom indicating?
  - Are there any hazardous blocks that reset the level?

Recent Observations:
  - Confirmed Color 8 (Grey Block) is a dynamic object affected by gravity (contradicting the hint that Color 4 is the only payload, or indicating multiple payload types).
  - Physics Confirmation: Objects slide continuously (multiple steps per turn) in the direction of gravity until obstructed.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 maps to 'Left' gravity/shield position.
  - Confirmed that objects slide continuously in the direction of gravity until a solid collision occurs (Green obstacles act as solid walls).
  - Confirmed that changing the shield position immediately resolves physics for all movable objects in the new direction.

I'm showing you a SEQUENCE of 6 LABELED images:
1. IMAGE 1: Frame BEFORE the action
2-6. IMAGEs 2-6: Animation frames showing the motion step by step

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Analyze ALL animation frames to understand the FULL motion path!
Objects may move multiple tiles - track their path through each frame.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!
2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects
3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context
4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)
5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect
6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.
7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.

Analyze what happened and provide your structured analysis.
