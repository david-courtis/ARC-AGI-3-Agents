  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION3.\n\nThis is the FIRST time observing this action.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick green outer frame enclosing the play area. The inner edge of the frame contains 4 slots (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) that can be either Blue (Inactive) or Pink (Active).\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Single-screen enclosed square arena with a 4-directional perimeter control system. Internal area contains static obstacles and dynamic moving objects.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A perimeter-defense or guidance puzzle. The player controls the location of an 'Active Shield' (Pink) on the four walls of the arena. An autonomous object (Grey Block) moves inside the arena. The goal is likely to guide this object into the Black U-shaped receptacle and/or prevent it from hitting the 'Inactive' (Blue) walls or leaving the screen. The player must timely switch the shield's position to bounce or block the object as it moves through the obstacle course.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - Behavior of the Grey Block upon collision with Pink vs Blue walls.\n  - Function of the Orange dot.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Active Shield: Color 14 (pink) Horizontal/Vertical Bar (4x48 pixels) (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: Controlled by player actions. Only one exists at a time. Moves between the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left) based on input.\n  - Inactive Walls: Color 1 (blue) Horizontal/Vertical Bar (Role hypothesis: wall)\n      Evidence: Occupies the perimeter slots when the Active Shield is not present. Likely acts as a solid wall or a hazard.\n  - Goal / Receptacle: Color 0 (black) U-shaped structure (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Distinctive dark shape with an opening. Typical visual language for a container or target zone.\n  - Auto-Moving Block: Color 8 (grey) Small Square (4x4) (Role hypothesis: ball/payload)\n      Evidence: Observed moving autonomously (downwards) in the change logs. Distinct from static terrain.\n  - Collectible: Color 4 (orange) Small dot/cluster (Role hypothesis: collectible)\n      Evidence: Small, distinct color, placed inside/near obstacles. Likely to be collected.\n  - Turn Timer / Indicator: Color 13 (pink) Small horizontal dash (Role hypothesis: UI Element)\n      Evidence: Located at the top UI border, likely tracks remaining moves or turns.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the specific behavior of the Inactive (Blue) walls? Do they kill the object or just block it?\n  - Does the 'Auto-Moving Block' follow gravity (always falls down) or does it bounce?\n  - How do we interact with the Orange Collectible? Must the block touch it?\n  - Does the Pink Shield bounce the block?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Black U-shape appears to be a static structure (Base) to be defended.\n  - Movement is restricted to the perimeter (Top, Right, Bottom, Left positions).\n  - The generic control scheme appears to be 'Direct Directional Mapping' (Up=Top, Right=Right, Down=Bottom, Left=Left).\n  - Evidence: Shield started at Top. ACTION1 (Up?) had no effect (already at Top). ACTION4 (Right) moved Top->Right. ACTION2 (Down) moved Right->Bottom.\n  - Internal objects (like the Grey Block) are dynamic and move during the action step (turn-based or time-step update).\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 429 pixels changed.

The player character (black U-shape at the bottom) remained in its position at row 53, and no projectiles or movement occurred. Given the game's visual similarity to a fixed shooter (e.g., Space Invaders) or paddle game (Avatar at bottom, enemies/obstacles above), vertical movement is likely restricted or disabled by the game rules.\nWhy this outcome: The game layout resembles a fixed-axis shooter or arcade game where the player is constrained to the bottom rows (horizontal movement only). Consequently, an input corresponding to 'Move UP' is ignored by the game logic or treated as a null action.\nConsistent: None"

      "content": "[My Analysis] HAD EFFECT\n\nInterpretation: The action caused the Pink Rectangular Bar (Color 14), previously located at the top edge of the playfield, to disappear and reappear along the right edge (effectively rotating the 'active wall' or 'shield' 90 degrees clockwise). The Black U-shape (Color 0) and Green clusters (Color 3) remained static and did not move. A small Pink indicator (Color 13) also appeared in the top UI bezel.\nWhy this outcome: The Pink Bar was at the top position. The 'Right' input caused it to shift to the next clockwise position (Right edge). The Black U-shape did not respond to movement inputs, suggesting it is a static base or target.\nConsistent: False"

An internal Grey Block (Color 8) moved downwards by 12 pixels. The Action counter/UI at the top updated.\nWhy this outcome: The Player Control (Pink Shield) was positioned on the Right edge. The 'Down' input (ACTION2) caused the shield to move to the Bottom edge, consistent with a directional control scheme where inputs map to the corresponding perimeter interaction slot.

showing you a SEQUENCE of 6 LABELED images:\n1. IMAGE 1: Frame BEFORE the action\n2-6. IMAGEs 2-6: Animation frames showing the motion step by step\n\n⚠️ IMPORTANT: Analyze ALL animation frames to understand the FULL motion path!\nObjects may move multiple tiles - track their path through each frame.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!\n2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects\n3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context\n4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)\n5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect\n6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.\n7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.\n\nAnalyze what happened and provide your structured analysis."
