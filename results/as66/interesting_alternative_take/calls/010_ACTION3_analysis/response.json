  "interpretation": "The action moved the visible Pink Shield (Player) from the Bottom perimeter to the Left perimeter. Simultaneously, the internal Grey Block (Color 8) moved horizontally to the left by 12 pixels (3 steps of 4 pixels each) until it encountered an obstacle (Green/Orange cluster). This strongly suggests that the player's directional input controls both the specific wall the Shield occupies AND the direction of 'gravity' or force applied to the internal object (e.g., Shield Left = Gravity Left).",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "Move LEFT: Relocates the Active Shield to the Left perimeter slot and applies a leftward force/movement to dynamic internal objects.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": true,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'Left' input was issued while the Shield was at the Bottom. The internal Grey Block had open space to its left. The game logic processed the input by moving the Shield to the Left and sliding the Block leftward until it hit a Green/Orange obstacle.",
  "objects_involved": [
    "Pink Shield (Color 14)",
    "Grey Block (Color 8)",
    "Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4)",

  "context_description": "The shield is now on the Left wall. The Grey Block has moved left and is resting against a central obstacle structure.",
  "had_effect": true,
  "no_effect_reason": null,
  "environment_updates": [
    "Confirmed Mechanic: 'Gravity/Directional Control'. The active shield position likely determines the gravitational pull for the internal block (Shield Left = Block falls Left).",
    "Movement Physics: The internal block moves continuously (multiple steps per turn) in the active direction until obstructed.",
    "Control Scheme Validation: Action 3 is confirmed as 'Left', completing the directional set (Up=1/Null, Down=2, Left=3, Right=4)."
