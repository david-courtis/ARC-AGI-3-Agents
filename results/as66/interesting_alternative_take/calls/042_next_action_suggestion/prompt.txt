=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

=== STAGE/LEVEL INFO ===
Current Stage: 2 (score: 1/254)
Actions in this stage: 6

Stage History:
  Stage 1: started at action 0, score=0
  Stage 2: started at action 8, score=1

ACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):
  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)
  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)

⚠️ NOTE: Only 4 actions are available in this game: ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: VERIFIED - Gravity UP / Wrap Gate: Moves Shield to Top. Sets gravity UP. ALLOWS WRAPPING: Objects slide UP, pass through the top edge, reappear at the bottom, and continue sliding up until blocked.
  ACTION2: VERIFIED - Gravity DOWN: Move Shield to Bottom. Applies downward force to internal objects.
  ACTION3: VERIFIED - Gravity LEFT / Wrap Gate: Moves Shield to Left. Sets gravity LEFT. ALLOWS WRAPPING: Objects slide LEFT, pass through left edge, reappear at right edge, continue sliding.
  ACTION4: VERIFIED - Gravity RIGHT / Wrap Gate: Moves Shield to Right. Sets gravity RIGHT. Objects slide RIGHT. If they hit the Pink Shield, they WRAP to the left.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))
  Description: A thick framework containing 4 slot positions for the active/inactive walls. The Active Shield (Pink) and Inactive Walls (Blue) sit within this frame.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Grid-based sliding puzzle. 64x64 pixel resolution presumably involved. The layout is designed with specific 'stops' (green blocks) to align the payload horizontally and vertically with the goal.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A 'Rotational Gravity' sliding puzzle. The player controls the direction of gravity by moving a portal/shield around the perimeter of the room. Objects in the room fall in the direction of the portal. They slide until they hit a wall or obstacle (Ice Physics). If they fall into the portal (Pink Shield), they wrap around to the other side. Success requires using the terrain to align the object with the goal.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.
  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).
  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).
  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).
  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.
  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).
  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.
  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.
  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.
  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).
  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.
  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.
  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.
  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.
  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.
  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.
  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.
  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.
  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).
  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.
  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.
  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).
  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).
  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.
  - Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.
  - Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.
  - Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.
  - Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.
  - CONFIRMED WRAP MECHANIC: The 'Active Shield' (Pink) functions as a portal. Objects do not stop at the shield; they pass through and wrap to the opposite side of the screen.
  - TOROIDAL TOPOLOGY: The playfield effectively becomes a cylinder in the direction of the active gravity.
  - NON-EUCLIDEAN MOVEMENT: 'Gravity Up' can result in the object appearing lower on the screen due to wrapping from Top to Bottom.
  - GRAVITY CONFIRMATION: Gravity pulls towards the Pink Shield. (Shield Top = Gravity Up).
  - CONFIRMED SCREEN WRAPPING: The Pink Shield allows the payload to exit the screen and re-enter from the opposite side. Evidence: Coordinate change from (48, 28) to (48, 48) under Left Gravity is only possible via a wrap.
  - Confirmed Gravity/Movement Dynamic: Action 4 moved Shield to Right -> Gravity became Right -> Payload slid Right.
  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload slid right until it hit a Green Obstacle (Color 3) at approx col 44. It did NOT wrap in this specific instance because an internal obstacle blocked the path to the edge.
  - Level Design Pattern: 'Catcher' blocks. The Green block at (48, 44) appears placed specifically to stop the payload at the correct X-coordinate for a future vertical alignment move.
  - STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT CONFIRMED: The Level Design uses internal obstacles as 'stops' to align the payload. The payload just moved UP and stopped against a Green block at row 36. This specific row appears to align perfectly with the 'opening' of the Black Goal.
  - GRAVITY UP DYNAMICS: Confirmed that setting Gravity UP (Action 1) causes the payload to 'fall' upwards until it hits a ceiling (Green obstacle in this case).
  - PUZZLE LOGIC: The solution path appears to be: 1. Slide Right (align X against wall), 2. Slide Up (align Y against ceiling), 3. Slide Left (enter Goal).

  - Top-left corner behavior (haven't visited yet)
  - Interaction with the Goal (haven't reached yet)

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Payload: Color 11 (grey) 4x4 square (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Interactable Object)
      Evidence: Moves in response to gravity changes; tracked by game score/logic; distinct form/color from static terrain.
  - Goal: Color 0 (black) C-shaped cup opening to the Right (Role hypothesis: Goal / Target)
      Evidence: Unique black color; shape suggests a 'receptacle' for the payload; located in a difficult-to-access spot.
  - Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters (Role hypothesis: Static Terrain / Stop)
      Evidence: Blocks payload movement; visible collision (payload stopped exactly underneath one).
  - Active Gravity Controller: Color 14 (pink) 48x4 bar (Role hypothesis: Gravity Source & Wrap Portal)
      Evidence: Position correlates 1:1 with gravity direction; allows entitites to pass through (previous observation).
  - Inactive Wall: Color 1 (blue) 48x4 bar (Role hypothesis: Solid Boundary)
      Evidence: Occupies perimeter slots not used by the active controller; presumptively solid based on previous observations.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Does the goal detect the payload immediately upon entry?
  - Will the payload stop inside the goal, or do we need a backstop to prevent it sliding through?
  - Is there a move limit beyond the visual indicators?

Recent Observations:
  - Confirmation: The Active Shield allows Screen Wrapping in the direction of gravity.
  - Strategy: The game uses obstacles as 'backstops' to align the payload. This move likely positioned the payload to slide left directly into the goal on the next turn.
  - Confirmed ACTION1 = Top / Gravity UP.
  - Confirmed Color 4 (Orange) acts as a solid obstacle in Stage 2, distinct from the payload (Color 11).
  - Payload slides continuously until collision (Ice Physics).

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): None

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: None

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action

Provide your structured suggestion.
