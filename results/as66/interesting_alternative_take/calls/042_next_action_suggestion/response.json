  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "The payload is currently trapped in an upper niche of the central green structure, where moving LEFT (Action 3) is blocked by a wall and moving UP (Action 1) has reached the ceiling. The Goal is located lower on the screen. By executing ACTION2 (Down), the payload should drop to a lower ledge visible below. From this lower Y-coordinate, it is hypothesized that the path to the left will be clear, allowing a subsequent Left move to enter the Goal's opening.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify if dropping down aligns the payload with a clear horizontal path to the Goal, or if additional wrapping maneuvers are required.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Payload is boxed in on the Top and Left. The Goal is vertically lower than the payload. A downward move is necessary to change alignment."
