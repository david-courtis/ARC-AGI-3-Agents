Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state!

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick green outer frame (1 pixel wide green, then blue/pink track)\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Enclosed arena with a central obstacle maze. Perimeter track controls gravity direction.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  Gravity-manipulation puzzle. The player rotates a gravity field (North/South/East/West) to slide a payload block around obstacles and into a specific goal receptacle.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The exact visual color code of the payload in this stage (appears Grey, logs claim Color 4).\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.\n  - Green terrain blocks movement.\n  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.\n  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.\n  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.\n  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - Diagonal movement is not observed.\n  - Payload blocked by Green obstacles.\n  - Payload currently pinned against the right side of the central obstacle due to Leftward gravity.\n  - Perimeter walls block exit.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.\n  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries\n  - Color 3 (green) central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) top-left small cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) bottom-right small cluster\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as walls\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Payload Block: Grey/Silver (possibly Color 4 or 8 in logs) Small Square (approx 4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Moveable Object)\n      Evidence: It is the only small, detached geometric object in the play area (besides the goal). Its position implies it reacts to gravity.\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) C-shaped / U-shaped cup (Role hypothesis: Goal)\n      Evidence: Distinctive shape same as previous stage; oriented to 'catch' the payload.\n  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Vertical Bar (Left side) (Role hypothesis: Gravity Controller)\n      Evidence: Located in the left perimeter slot. Indicates current gravity direction is LEFT.\n  - Obstacle Cluster: Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs (Role hypothesis: Static Terrain)\n      Evidence: Payload appears to be resting against the central green cluster, blocked from moving left.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Is the payload color consistent across stages (logs say Color 4, visuals show Grey/Color 5/8)?\n  - Do red background pixels adjacent to walls traverse differently?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Pink Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacle (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Bar (Active Shield): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Orange Block (Payload): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green Obstacle (Terrain): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Left Perimeter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Payload Block (Orange/Color 4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Goal Receptacle (Black/Color 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Active Shield (Pink/Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Confirmed that objects slide continuously in the direction of gravity until a solid collision occurs (Green obstacles act as solid walls).\n  - Confirmed that changing the shield position immediately resolves physics for all movable objects in the new direction.\n  - Confirmed: The Black U-shape (Color 0) is the Goal.\n  - Confirmed: Placing the Payload Block into the Goal triggers a Level Completion/Transition.\n  - Physics: Gravity applies immediately, causing falling objects to traverse open space until hitting a collider or goal.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
