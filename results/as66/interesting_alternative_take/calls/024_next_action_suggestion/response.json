  "reasoning": "We have just entered Stage 2. The board is in a default state with the Active Shield on the Left (Gravity: LEFT) and the payload (grey block) resting against the central green obstacle. To the immediate right of the payload, the path is clear (red background) until the right perimeter wall. Executing ACTION4 (Right) is strategically the best choice because: 1) It will verify the 'Right Gravity' mechanic in this new stage (currently only 1/3 verified). 2) It guarantees movement of the payload to the right wall, avoiding the potentially cluttered vertical path below the payload. 3) Positioning the payload against the right wall sets up a clean 'Down -> Left' sequence to reach the goal in the bottom-left corner.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm that ACTION4 moves the Active Shield to the Right perimeter and applies Rightward gravity. We expect the payload (grey block) to slide across the open space and stop against the blue right-side wall, confirming its identity as the movable object.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Stage 2 Start. Gravity is pulling Left (Pink Shield on Left). Payload is pinned against the right side of the central green obstacle structure. The goal is visible in the bottom-left. The right side of the board is clear of obstacles."
