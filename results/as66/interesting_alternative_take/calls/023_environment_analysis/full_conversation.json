    "content": "You are an environment analyst studying an unknown game world.\n\nYour SOLE FOCUS is understanding the ENVIRONMENT - not the actions.\n\nCRITICAL: YOUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING MAY BE WRONG!\n- Previous object identifications and role hypotheses are TENTATIVE and may need correction\n- If action results contradict your current understanding, UPDATE IT\n- You can and SHOULD replace incorrect objects/roles with better interpretations\n- Every analysis is an opportunity to REFINE or CORRECT the environment model\n\nYou must discover and document:\n1. BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

This caused the active gravity direction to switch to 'Down'. Th\nEvidence Status: STATE CHANGE OBSERVED - Use this as evidence!\n\nRECENT CHANGES OBSERVED (THIS IS EVIDENCE!):\nTotal: 994 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_right_playarea (272), upper_left_playarea (256), lower_right_playarea (224), lower_left_playarea (160), top_ui (70), bottom_ui (7), left_edge (3), right_edge (2) Changes in both play area and UI elements.

This caused the active gravity direction to switch to 'Down'. The Payload Block (Orange/Color 4), which was positioned directly above the Black Goal Receptacle (Color 0), fell downwards into the goal. Upon entering the goal, the level was completed, triggering a transition to a new stage (Stage 3 or next puzzle) with a completely different layout (Image 6).\nWhy This Outcome: The Payload Block was aligned vertically with the Goal Receptacle. There were no obstacles between the block and the goal in the downward direction. Applying downward gravity (Action 2) allowed the block to fall freely into the target, satisfying the win condition.\nEnvironment Updates Discovered:\n  - Confirmed: The Black U-shape (Color 0) is the Goal.\n  - Confirmed: Placing the Payload Block into the Goal triggers a Level Completion/Transition.\n  - Physics: Gravity applies immediately, causing falling objects to traverse open space until hitting a collider or goal.\nObjects Involved: Payload Block (Orange/Color 4), Goal Receptacle (Black/Color 0), Active Shield (Pink/Color 14)\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above insights were discovered by analyzing the action's effect.\nUse these insights to UPDATE your environment understanding!\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING (MAY BE WRONG - UPDATE IF NEEDED):\nBackground: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\nBorder: Yes (Color 3 (green)) - A thick green outer frame enclosing the play area. Inside this frame is a secondary track containing the 4 directional slots for the shield/gravity controller.\nInternal walls/obstacles:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.\n  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.\n  - Green terrain blocks movement.\n  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.\n  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.\n  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.\n  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - Diagonal movement is not observed.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Rectangular Bar (vertical) (Role: Gravity Controller)\n  - Inactive Shield Slot: Color 1 (blue) Rectangular Bar (Role: Passive Boundary)\n  - Payload Block: Color 4 (orange) Small Square (approx 4x4) (Role: Player Character / Moving Object)\n  - Terrain Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters (Role: Static Wall)\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) U-shape / Cup (Role: Goal)\n  - Progress/Info Bar: Yellow Line (Role: UI Element)\nSpatial structure: 64x64 Grid containing a gravity-based maze. The play area is bounded by a controller track. Inside, green obstacles form a maze that the orange block must navigate through gravity manipulation.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n- The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n- Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n- Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n- The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n- CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n- SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n- DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n- CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n- Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n- Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n- Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n- Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n- Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n- Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n- Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n- Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n- Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- Does the payload need to settle INSIDE the 'cup' of importance (requiring Down gravity to enter) or just touch it?\n- What is the Yellow bar at the bottom indicating?\n- Are there any hazardous blocks that reset the level?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"Gravity UP: Move Shield to Top. Applies upward force to internal objects.\"\n  ACTION2: \"Gravity DOWN: Move Shield to Bottom. Applies downward force to internal objects.\"\n  ACTION3: \"Gravity LEFT: Move Shield to Left Perimeter. Applies leftward force to internal payload.\"\n  ACTION4: \"Gravity RIGHT: Move Shield to Right. Applies rightward force to internal objects.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n7. UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS: Which colors or sections of the grid have NOT been thoroughly analyzed yet? List specific colors or regions that need more investigation.\n8. DOMAIN DESCRIPTION: Provide a high-level conceptual description of the game. What type of game is this (puzzle, navigation, sokoban-like, etc.)? What appears to be the goal? How do the mechanics work together at a conceptual level?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
