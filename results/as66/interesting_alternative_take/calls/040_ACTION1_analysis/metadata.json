  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:\n\"Gravity UP / Wrap Gate: Moves Shield to Top. Sets gravity UP. ALLOWS WRAPPING: Objects slide UP, pass through the top edge, reappear at the bottom, and continue sliding up until blocked.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT\n      Context: The player is positioned at the bottom of a bounded playfield (Color 15/F background), facing upward towards green shape clusters (Color 3). The environment is static.\n      Interpretation: The action resulted in no visible changes to the game state. The player character (black U-shape at the bottom) remained in its position at row 53, and no projectiles or movement occurred. Given the game's visual similarity to a fixed shooter (e.g., Space Invaders) or paddle game (Avatar at bottom, enemies/obstacles above), vertical movement is likely restricted or disabled by the game rules.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The player is navigating a payload through a maze using directional gravity. The Shield moved from Left -> Top. The payload remained pinned under an obstacle.\n      Interpretation: The action activated the 'Top' perimeter shield, moving the visible Pink Bar from the Left edge to the Top edge. This corresponds to setting the gravitational pull to 'Up'. However, the internal Grey Block (payload) did not move upwards, likely because it is positioned directly beneath an overhang of the green obstacle structure, preventing vertical movement in that direction.\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The payload was positioned with a clear vertical path to the top edge. The move to Top Gravity accelerated it towards the Active Shield.\n      Interpretation: The action moved the Active Pink Shield to the Top perimeter, setting the gravity direction to UP. The Grey Payload (Color 11) 'fell' upwards. Critically, instead of stopping when it reached the Top edge (where the Active Shield was located), it passed through the boundary and wrapped around to the Bottom of the playfield (Screen Wrap). It continued moving upwards from the bottom edge until it collided with the underside of a central Green Obstacle, where it came to rest.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick Green (Color 3) outer frame separating play area from UI. Inside this frame are 4 slots for the perimeter walls.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based arena with toroidal topology enabled by the Active Shield. Objects slide in straight lines along the grid until collision.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A sliding-block puzzle with a twist: the player controls the 'gravity' direction by moving a portal-shield around the perimeter. The goal is to slide the payload block into a specific receptacle. The key mechanics are sliding physics (ice), gravity manipulation, and screen wrapping through the active portal wall.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).\n  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).\n  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.\n  - Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.\n  - Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.\n  - Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.\n  - Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.\n  - CONFIRMED WRAP MECHANIC: The 'Active Shield' (Pink) functions as a portal. Objects do not stop at the shield; they pass through and wrap to the opposite side of the screen.\n  - TOROIDAL TOPOLOGY: The playfield effectively becomes a cylinder in the direction of the active gravity.\n  - NON-EUCLIDEAN MOVEMENT: 'Gravity Up' can result in the object appearing lower on the screen due to wrapping from Top to Bottom.\n  - GRAVITY CONFIRMATION: Gravity pulls towards the Pink Shield. (Shield Top = Gravity Up).\n  - CONFIRMED SCREEN WRAPPING: The Pink Shield allows the payload to exit the screen and re-enter from the opposite side. Evidence: Coordinate change from (48, 28) to (48, 48) under Left Gravity is only possible via a wrap.\n  - Confirmed Gravity/Movement Dynamic: Action 4 moved Shield to Right -> Gravity became Right -> Payload slid Right.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload slid right until it hit a Green Obstacle (Color 3) at approx col 44. It did NOT wrap in this specific instance because an internal obstacle blocked the path to the edge.\n  - Level Design Pattern: 'Catcher' blocks. The Green block at (48, 44) appears placed specifically to stop the payload at the correct X-coordinate for a future vertical alignment move.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The exact interaction triggers for the goal (Color 0).\n  - Behavior of corners where Blue and Pink walls meet.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  -

Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) 48x4 bar (Role hypothesis: Gravity Source & Wrap Portal)\n      Evidence: Position determines gravity direction (currently Right). Previous evidence suggests it allows objects to wrap around the screen.\n  - Inactive Wall: Color 1 (blue) 48x4 bar (Role hypothesis: Solid Boundary)\n      Evidence: Occupies perimeter slots not used by the active shield; blocks movement (assumed based on game logic).\n  - Goal: Color 0 (black) C-shaped cup (Role hypothesis: Target / End point)\n      Evidence: Distinct shape resembling a receptacle; located in a difficult-to-reach spot; standard puzzle, game trope.\n  - Internal Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular blocks (Role hypothesis: Static Terrain)\n      Evidence: Does not move; stops the payload when collided with (observed this turn).\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Does the Black Goal 'catch' the payload automatically, or does it act as empty space that requires a backstop?\n  - What happens if the payload aligns with the Pink Shield but hits the corner of the frame?\n  - Is there a maximum slide distance?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Pink Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacle (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Bar (Active Shield): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Orange Block (Payload): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green Obstacle (Terrain): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Left Perimeter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Payload Block (Orange/Color 4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Goal Receptacle (Black/Color 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Active Shield (Pink/Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Payload Block (Color 11): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Green Obstacles (Color 3): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Perimeter: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Green Obstacle (Color 3): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Active Gravity Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 11): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Grey Payload (Color 11): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Active Gravity Shield (Pink/Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Internal Obstacle (Green/Color 3 or Orange/Color 4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - CONFIRMED: The 'Active Shield' permits horizontal screen wrapping (Left <-> Right) in addition to vertical wrapping.\n  - The payload maintains its row (Y-coordinate) during a horizontal wrap.\n  - Internal obstacles (Color 3) effectively catch wrapped objects.\n  - Confirmation: The Active Shield allows Screen Wrapping in the direction of gravity.\n  - Strategy: The game uses obstacles as 'backstops' to align the payload. This move likely positioned the payload to slide left directly into the goal on the next turn.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 432 pixels changed.

Sets gravity UP. ALLOWS WRAPPING: Objects slide UP, pass through the top edge, reappear at the bottom, and continue sliding up until blocked.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS FOR THIS ACTION (3 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT\n      Context: The player is positioned at the bottom of a bounded playfield (Color 15/F background), facing upward towards green shape clusters (Color 3). The environment is static.\n      Interpretation: The action resulted in no visible changes to the game state. The player character (black U-shape at the bottom) remained in its position at row 53, and no projectiles or movement occurred. Given the game's visual similarity to a fixed shooter (e.g., Space Invaders) or paddle game (Avatar at bottom, enemies/obstacles above), vertical movement is likely restricted or disabled by the game rules.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The player is navigating a payload through a maze using directional gravity. The Shield moved from Left -> Top. The payload remained pinned under an obstacle.\n      Interpretation: The action activated the 'Top' perimeter shield, moving the visible Pink Bar from the Left edge to the Top edge. This corresponds to setting the gravitational pull to 'Up'. However, the internal Grey Block (payload) did not move upwards, likely because it is positioned directly beneath an overhang of the green obstacle structure, preventing vertical movement in that direction.\n  [3] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The payload was positioned with a clear vertical path to the top edge. The move to Top Gravity accelerated it towards the Active Shield.\n      Interpretation: The action moved the Active Pink Shield to the Top perimeter, setting the gravity direction to UP. The Grey Payload (Color 11) 'fell' upwards. Critically, instead of stopping when it reached the Top edge (where the Active Shield was located), it passed through the boundary and wrapped around to the Bottom of the playfield (Screen Wrap). It continued moving upwards from the bottom edge until it collided with the underside of a central Green Obstacle, where it came to rest.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick Green (Color 3) outer frame separating play area from UI. Inside this frame are 4 slots for the perimeter walls.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based arena with toroidal topology enabled by the Active Shield. Objects slide in straight lines along the grid until collision.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A sliding-block puzzle with a twist: the player controls the 'gravity' direction by moving a portal-shield around the perimeter. The goal is to slide the payload block into a specific receptacle. The key mechanics are sliding physics (ice), gravity manipulation, and screen wrapping through the active portal wall.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).\n  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).\n  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.\n  - Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.\n  - Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.\n  - Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.\n  - Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.\n  - CONFIRMED WRAP MECHANIC: The 'Active Shield' (Pink) functions as a portal. Objects do not stop at the shield; they pass through and wrap to the opposite side of the screen.\n  - TOROIDAL TOPOLOGY: The playfield effectively becomes a cylinder in the direction of the active gravity.\n  - NON-EUCLIDEAN MOVEMENT: 'Gravity Up' can result in the object appearing lower on the screen due to wrapping from Top to Bottom.\n  - GRAVITY CONFIRMATION: Gravity pulls towards the Pink Shield. (Shield Top = Gravity Up).\n  - CONFIRMED SCREEN WRAPPING: The Pink Shield allows the payload to exit the screen and re-enter from the opposite side. Evidence: Coordinate change from (48, 28) to (48, 48) under Left Gravity is only possible via a wrap.\n  - Confirmed Gravity/Movement Dynamic: Action 4 moved Shield to Right -> Gravity became Right -> Payload slid Right.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload slid right until it hit a Green Obstacle (Color 3) at approx col 44. It did NOT wrap in this specific instance because an internal obstacle blocked the path to the edge.\n  - Level Design Pattern: 'Catcher' blocks. The Green block at (48, 44) appears placed specifically to stop the payload at the correct X-coordinate for a future vertical alignment move.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The exact interaction triggers for the goal (Color 0).\n  - Behavior of corners where Blue and Pink walls meet.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  -

showing you a SEQUENCE of 6 LABELED images:\n1. IMAGE 1: Frame BEFORE the action\n2-6. IMAGEs 2-6: Animation frames showing the motion step by step\n\n⚠️ IMPORTANT: Analyze ALL animation frames to understand the FULL motion path!\nObjects may move multiple tiles - track their path through each frame.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!\n2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects\n3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context\n4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)\n5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect\n6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.\n7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.\n\nAnalyze what happened and provide your structured analysis."
