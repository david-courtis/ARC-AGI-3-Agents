  "interpretation": "The action moved the Active Pink Shield from the Right perimeter to the Left perimeter. This changed the gravity direction to 'Left'. Consequently, the Orange Payload block slid horizontally to the left across the open space until it collided with the vertical edge of the central Green obstacle structure, where it stopped.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The Pink Shield was previously on the Right. The 'Left' input (ACTION3) successfully relocated it to the Left slot. The internal payload had empty space to its left, allowing it to slide freely under the new gravitational force until obstructed by the static Green terrain.",
