If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick Green (Color 3) outer frame (approx 4px) surrounding the play area. Just inside this frame are 4 'slots' for the perimeter walls/shields.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based arena with toroidal (wrapping) topology along the axis of the Active Shield.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A sliding-block puzzle game with a twist: the player controls gravity direction by moving a 'Shield' around the perimeter. This Shield also acts as a 'Screen Wrap Gate', allowing the payload to loop around the level. The goal is to navigate a sliding block into a specific target receptacle by manipulating gravity and utilizing obstacles and screen-wrapping to align the path.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).\n  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).\n  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.\n  - Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.\n  - Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.\n  - Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.\n  - Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.\n  - CONFIRMED WRAP MECHANIC: The 'Active Shield' (Pink) functions as a portal. Objects do not stop at the shield; they pass through and wrap to the opposite side of the screen.\n  - TOROIDAL TOPOLOGY: The playfield effectively becomes a cylinder in the direction of the active gravity.\n  - NON-EUCLIDEAN MOVEMENT: 'Gravity Up' can result in the object appearing lower on the screen due to wrapping from Top to Bottom.\n  - GRAVITY CONFIRMATION: Gravity pulls towards the Pink Shield. (Shield Top = Gravity Up).\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - Behavior of the yellow bar at the bottom (Timer?)\n  - Behavior of the purple line at the top (Turn counter?)\n  - Interaction with the goal object\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.\n  - Green terrain blocks movement.\n  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.\n  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.\n  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.\n  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - Diagonal movement is not observed.\n  - Payload blocked by Green obstacles.\n  - Payload currently pinned against the right side of the central obstacle due to Leftward gravity.\n  - Perimeter walls block exit.\n  - Payload physics are 'slide until collision' (ice physics).\n  - Green (Color 3) internal terrain blocks movement.\n  - Perimeter walls (Blue/Green) block movement.\n  - Goal walls (Black) likely block movement from the wrong direction (must enter open side).\n  - Payload slides continuously in the direction of gravity until blocked.\n  - Gravity direction is determined by the position of the Pink Shield (Bottom = Down).\n  - Green obstacles (Color 3) are solid and block movement/support the payload.\n  - Perimeter walls block movement.\n  - Payload must enter Goal from the open side (Right).\n  - Payload slides continuously in the direction of the Pink Shield.\n  - Green (Color 3) and Blue (Color 1) objects are SOLID and block movement.\n  - Pink (Color 14) Shield is PERMEABLE and allows SCREEN WRAPPING.\n  - Wrapping preserves momentum: exiting Top -> entering Bottom -> continuing Up.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.\n  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries\n  - Color 3 (green) central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) top-left small cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) bottom-right small cluster\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as walls\n  - Color 3 (green) large central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) smaller peripheral clusters (top-left, bottom-right)\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments (Top, Left, Bottom currently)\n  - Color 14 (pink) active perimeter segment (Right currently)\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as obstacles and platforms\n  - Color 3 (green) central large cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) smaller isolated blocks acting as 'catchers' for the payload\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as solid walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters act as solid internal terrain\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments act as solid walls\n  - Color 14 (pink) perimeter segment acts as a GRAVITY SOURCE and WRAP GATE\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Payload Block: Color 11 (grey) 4x4 pixel square (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Dynamic Object)\n      Evidence: Moves in response to gravity changes. Slides until collision. Just observed moving from center to bottom via screen-wrap.\n  - Active Shield / Gravity Gate: Color 14 (pink) 48x4 pixel rectangular bar (Role hypothesis: Gravity Controller & Portal)\n      Evidence: Determines gravity direction. Unlike blue walls, it permits objects to pass through and wrap to the opposite screen edge.\n  - Inactive Wall: Color 1 (blue) 48x4 pixel rectangular bar (Role hypothesis: Solid Boundary)\n      Evidence: Exists in perimeter slots not occupied by the Pink Shield. Blocks movement.\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) C-shaped cup opening to the Right (Role hypothesis: Goal)\n      Evidence: Distinct shape and color, often associated with targets. Geometry implies directional entry.\n  - Internal Obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters (Role hypothesis: Static Terrain)\n      Evidence: Blocks payload movement. Supports payload when resting against it.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Does wrapping apply to all 4 directions if the shield is moved there?\n  - Does the payload need to stop INSIDE the goal, or just pass through?\n  - What is the precise trigger for the win state? (Overlap vs Full Containment)\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Pink Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacle (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Bar (Active Shield): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Orange Block (Payload): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green Obstacle (Terrain): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Left Perimeter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Payload Block (Orange/Color 4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Goal Receptacle (Black/Color 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Active Shield (Pink/Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Payload Block (Color 11): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Green Obstacles (Color 3): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Perimeter: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Green Obstacle (Color 3): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Active Gravity Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 11): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Confirmed: Green obstacles (Color 3) act as solid floors/walls for the payload.\n  - The Active Shield (Pink) is NOT a solid wall; it functions as a Wrap Gate/Portal.\n  - The playfield topology is toroidal (loops edges) in the direction of the Active Shield.\n  - Inactive Blue borders function as solid walls that prevent wrapping.\n  - Objects wrap to the opposite edge and continue moving in the direction of gravity until blocked by an internal obstacle.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION2\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
