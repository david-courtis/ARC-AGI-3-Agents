=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))
  Description: Thick Green (Color 3) outer frame (approx 4px) surrounding the play area. Just inside this frame are 4 'slots' for the perimeter walls/shields.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Grid-based arena with toroidal (wrapping) topology along the axis of the Active Shield.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A sliding-block puzzle game with a twist: the player controls gravity direction by moving a 'Shield' around the perimeter. This Shield also acts as a 'Screen Wrap Gate', allowing the payload to loop around the level. The goal is to navigate a sliding block into a specific target receptacle by manipulating gravity and utilizing obstacles and screen-wrapping to align the path.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.
  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).
  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).
  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).
  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.
  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).
  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.
  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.
  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.
  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).
  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.
  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.
  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.
  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.
  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.
  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.
  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.
  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.
  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).
  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.
  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.
  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).
  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).
  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.
  - Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.
  - Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.
  - Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.
  - Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.
  - CONFIRMED WRAP MECHANIC: The 'Active Shield' (Pink) functions as a portal. Objects do not stop at the shield; they pass through and wrap to the opposite side of the screen.
  - TOROIDAL TOPOLOGY: The playfield effectively becomes a cylinder in the direction of the active gravity.
  - NON-EUCLIDEAN MOVEMENT: 'Gravity Up' can result in the object appearing lower on the screen due to wrapping from Top to Bottom.
  - GRAVITY CONFIRMATION: Gravity pulls towards the Pink Shield. (Shield Top = Gravity Up).

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - Behavior of the yellow bar at the bottom (Timer?)
  - Behavior of the purple line at the top (Turn counter?)
  - Interaction with the goal object

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Payload Block: Color 11 (grey) 4x4 pixel square (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Dynamic Object)
      Evidence: Moves in response to gravity changes. Slides until collision. Just observed moving from center to bottom via screen-wrap.
  - Active Shield / Gravity Gate: Color 14 (pink) 48x4 pixel rectangular bar (Role hypothesis: Gravity Controller & Portal)
      Evidence: Determines gravity direction. Unlike blue walls, it permits objects to pass through and wrap to the opposite screen edge.
  - Inactive Wall: Color 1 (blue) 48x4 pixel rectangular bar (Role hypothesis: Solid Boundary)
      Evidence: Exists in perimeter slots not occupied by the Pink Shield. Blocks movement.
  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) C-shaped cup opening to the Right (Role hypothesis: Goal)
      Evidence: Distinct shape and color, often associated with targets. Geometry implies directional entry.
  - Internal Obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters (Role hypothesis: Static Terrain)
      Evidence: Blocks payload movement. Supports payload when resting against it.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Does wrapping apply to all 4 directions if the shield is moved there?
  - Does the payload need to stop INSIDE the goal, or just pass through?
  - What is the precise trigger for the win state? (Overlap vs Full Containment)

Recent Observations:
  - Confirmed: Green obstacles (Color 3) act as solid floors/walls for the payload.
  - The Active Shield (Pink) is NOT a solid wall; it functions as a Wrap Gate/Portal.
  - The playfield topology is toroidal (loops edges) in the direction of the Active Shield.
  - Inactive Blue borders function as solid walls that prevent wrapping.
  - Objects wrap to the opposite edge and continue moving in the direction of gravity until blocked by an internal obstacle.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION2
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action

Provide your structured suggestion.
