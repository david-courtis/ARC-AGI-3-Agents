  "target_action": "ACTION3",

  "reasoning": "ACTION3 is currently unverified (2/3 consistent) and is the most logical next step. The current gravity is UP (Action 1), holding the payload against a green obstacle. The Goal (Black C-shape) is to the left of the payload. Switching gravity to LEFT (Action 3) will verify the action's effect and potentially slide the payload into the goal or collide it with the goal structure, providing crucial information about goal interaction and collision physics.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify ACTION3 as 'Gravity LEFT'. Determine if the payload's Y-alignment allows it to enter the Goal or if it collides with the goal's wall. Observe if the 'Pink Shield' on the left allows wrapping if the payload misses the goal.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Gravity is UP (Pink Shield at Top). The Payload (Grey Block) is pressed against the bottom of a Green Obstacle. The path to the Left is open, leading towards the Goal."
