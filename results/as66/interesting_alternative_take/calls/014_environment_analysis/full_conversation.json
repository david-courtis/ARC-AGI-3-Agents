BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

        "text": "Analyze the environment in this game frame.\n\n=== STAGE/LEVEL INFO ===\nCurrent Stage: 1 (score: 0/254)\nActions in this stage: 6\n\n\nWHAT JUST HAPPENED:\nACTION1 had effect: The action activated the 'Top' perimeter shield, moving the visible Pink Bar from the Left edge to t\nEvidence Status: STATE CHANGE OBSERVED - Use this as evidence!\n\nRECENT CHANGES OBSERVED (THIS IS EVIDENCE!):\nTotal: 396 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (192), upper_right_playarea (96), lower_left_playarea (96), top_ui (12) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [4-56]\n\nObject-level changes: APPEARED: 1 objects\n  + Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8)\nDISAPPEARED: 1 objects\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)\n\n\n=== ACTION ANALYSIS INSIGHTS (from previous LLM analysis of this action) ===\nFull Interpretation: The action activated the 'Top' perimeter shield, moving the visible Pink Bar from the Left edge to the Top edge. This corresponds to setting the gravitational pull to 'Up'. However, the internal Grey Block (payload) did not move upwards, likely because it is positioned directly beneath an overhang of the green obstacle structure, preventing vertical movement in that direction.\nWhy This Outcome: The Active Shield was previously on the Left. ACTION1 (Up) successfully moved it to the Top. The internal Grey Block (Color 8) was resting against the left obstacle. When gravity shifted to UP, the block's path was obstructed by the 'branches' of the green tree-like structure directly above it (visible in the image, though the low-res ASCII grid text suggests empty space 'F', the complex shape likely has a collision map blocking the path). Thus, no physics movement was resolved.\nEnvironment Updates Discovered:\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Action 1 = Top Wall / Up Gravity.\n  - Confirmed absolute positioning: Input determines specific wall, not relative rotation.\n  - Physics Constraint: Internal objects do not move if their path in the strictly new gravity direction is immediately blocked by terrain.\nObjects Involved: Active Shield (Color 14), Payload Block (Color 8), Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3)\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above insights were discovered by analyzing the action's effect.\nUse these insights to UPDATE your environment understanding!\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING (MAY BE WRONG - UPDATE IF NEEDED):\nBackground: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\nBorder: Yes (Color 3 (green)) - Thick green outer frame. Looking closer, there are cyan/blue corner blocks. The playable perimeter contains 4 slots (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) that switch between Active (Pink) and Inactive (Blue).\nInternal walls/obstacles:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\nIdentified objects:\n  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Rectangular Bar (4x48 or 48x4) (Role: player / gravity controller)\n  - Payload Block: Color 8 (grey) Small Square (4x4) (Role: payload / character)\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) U-shaped structure (Role: goal)\n  - Collectible: Color 4 (orange) Small dot (single pixel or small cluster) (Role: collectible / key)\n  - Inactive Wall: Color 1 (blue) Rectangular Bar (Role: wall)\n  - Turn Timer / UI: Color 13 (pink/magenta) Small dash/line at very top (Role: UI Element)\nSpatial structure: Enclosed 64x64 grid with a gravity-based physics system. The perimeter is the control interface, while the interior is the puzzle space.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n- The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n- Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n- Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n- The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n- CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n- SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n- DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- Does the Grey Block stop immediately upon hitting the Goal (Black U-shape), or does it need to land 'inside' it correctly?\n- What happens if the internal block hits an Inactive (Blue) wall? Does it bounce or stop?\n- Does the Orange Collectible disappear on contact?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"Gravity UP: Move Shield to Top. Applies upward force to internal objects.\"\n  ACTION2: \"Gravity DOWN: Move Shield to Bottom. Applies downward force to internal objects.\"\n  ACTION3: \"Move LEFT: Relocates the Active Shield to the Left perimeter slot and applies a leftward force/movement to dynamic internal objects.\"\n  ACTION4: \"Gravity RIGHT: Move Shield to Right. Applies rightward force to internal objects.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n7. UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS: Which colors or sections of the grid have NOT been thoroughly analyzed yet? List specific colors or regions that need more investigation.\n8. DOMAIN DESCRIPTION: Provide a high-level conceptual description of the game. What type of game is this (puzzle, navigation, sokoban-like, etc.)? What appears to be the goal? How do the mechanics work together at a conceptual level?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
