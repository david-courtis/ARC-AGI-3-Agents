  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:\n\"Gravity RIGHT: Move Shield to Right. Applies rightward force to internal objects.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: The game appears to be a perimeter-defense or paddle game where the player controls a Pink Bar (Color 14) acting as a shield or reflector on the borders. The central playfield contains a static Black U-shape (Base) and Green enemies.\n      Interpretation: The action caused the Pink Rectangular Bar (Color 14), previously located at the top edge of the playfield, to disappear and reappear along the right edge (effectively rotating the 'active wall' or 'shield' 90 degrees clockwise). The Black U-shape (Color 0) and Green clusters (Color 3) remained static and did not move. A small Pink indicator (Color 13) also appeared in the top UI bezel.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Shield moves Top -> Right. Gravity shifts Right. Payload slides Right.\n      Interpretation: The visible Pink Shield moved from the Top edge to the Right edge. This change in the 'Active Shield' position redirected the environmental gravity to the Right, causing the internal Grey Block (Color 8) to slide rightward by 12 pixels until it collided with a static obstacle (Green/Orange cluster).\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick green outer frame (1 pixel wide green, then blue/pink track)\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Enclosed arena with a central obstacle maze. Perimeter track controls gravity direction.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  Gravity-manipulation puzzle. The player rotates a gravity field (North/South/East/West) to slide a payload block around obstacles and into a specific goal receptacle.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The exact visual color code of the payload in this stage (appears Grey, logs claim Color 4).\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.\n  - Green terrain blocks movement.\n  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.\n  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.\n  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.\n  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - Diagonal movement is not observed.\n  - Payload blocked by Green obstacles.\n  - Payload currently pinned against the right side of the central obstacle due to Leftward gravity.\n  - Perimeter walls block exit.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.\n  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries\n  - Color 3 (green) central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) top-left small cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) bottom-right small cluster\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as walls\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Payload Block: Grey/Silver (possibly Color 4 or 8 in logs) Small Square (approx 4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Moveable Object)\n      Evidence: It is the only small, detached geometric object in the play area (besides the goal). Its position implies it reacts to gravity.\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) C-shaped / U-shaped cup (Role hypothesis: Goal)\n      Evidence: Distinctive shape same as previous stage; oriented to 'catch' the payload.\n  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Vertical Bar (Left side) (Role hypothesis: Gravity Controller)\n      Evidence: Located in the left perimeter slot. Indicates current gravity direction is LEFT.\n  - Obstacle Cluster: Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs (Role hypothesis: Static Terrain)\n      Evidence: Payload appears to be resting against the central green cluster, blocked from moving left.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Is the payload color consistent across stages (logs say Color 4, visuals show Grey/Color 5/8)?\n  - Do red background pixels adjacent to walls traverse differently?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Pink Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacle (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Bar (Active Shield): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Orange Block (Payload): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green Obstacle (Terrain): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Left Perimeter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Payload Block (Orange/Color 4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Goal Receptacle (Black/Color 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Active Shield (Pink/Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Confirmed that objects slide continuously in the direction of gravity until a solid collision occurs (Green obstacles act as solid walls).\n  - Confirmed that changing the shield position immediately resolves physics for all movable objects in the new direction.\n  - Confirmed: The Black U-shape (Color 0) is the Goal.\n  - Confirmed: Placing the Payload Block into the Goal triggers a Level Completion/Transition.\n  - Physics: Gravity applies immediately, causing falling objects to traverse open space until hitting a collider or goal.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 432 pixels changed.

ACTION1 (Up) successfully moved it to the Top. The internal Grey Block (Color 8) was resting against the left obstacle. When gravity shifted to UP, the block's path was obstructed by the 'branches' of the green tree-like structure directly above it (visible in the image, though the low-res ASCII grid text suggests empty space 'F', the complex shape likely has a collision map blocking the path).

Applies rightward force to internal objects.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS FOR THIS ACTION (2 total):\n  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)\n      Context: The game appears to be a perimeter-defense or paddle game where the player controls a Pink Bar (Color 14) acting as a shield or reflector on the borders. The central playfield contains a static Black U-shape (Base) and Green enemies.\n      Interpretation: The action caused the Pink Rectangular Bar (Color 14), previously located at the top edge of the playfield, to disappear and reappear along the right edge (effectively rotating the 'active wall' or 'shield' 90 degrees clockwise). The Black U-shape (Color 0) and Green clusters (Color 3) remained static and did not move. A small Pink indicator (Color 13) also appeared in the top UI bezel.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: Shield moves Top -> Right. Gravity shifts Right. Payload slides Right.\n      Interpretation: The visible Pink Shield moved from the Top edge to the Right edge. This change in the 'Active Shield' position redirected the environmental gravity to the Right, causing the internal Grey Block (Color 8) to slide rightward by 12 pixels until it collided with a static obstacle (Green/Orange cluster).\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick green outer frame (1 pixel wide green, then blue/pink track)\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Enclosed arena with a central obstacle maze. Perimeter track controls gravity direction.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  Gravity-manipulation puzzle. The player rotates a gravity field (North/South/East/West) to slide a payload block around obstacles and into a specific goal receptacle.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The exact visual color code of the payload in this stage (appears Grey, logs claim Color 4).\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.\n  - Green terrain blocks movement.\n  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.\n  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.\n  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.\n  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - Diagonal movement is not observed.\n  - Payload blocked by Green obstacles.\n  - Payload currently pinned against the right side of the central obstacle due to Leftward gravity.\n  - Perimeter walls block exit.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.\n  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries\n  - Color 3 (green) central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) top-left small cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) bottom-right small cluster\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as walls\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Payload Block: Grey/Silver (possibly Color 4 or 8 in logs) Small Square (approx 4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Moveable Object)\n      Evidence: It is the only small, detached geometric object in the play area (besides the goal). Its position implies it reacts to gravity.\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) C-shaped / U-shaped cup (Role hypothesis: Goal)\n      Evidence: Distinctive shape same as previous stage; oriented to 'catch' the payload.\n  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Vertical Bar (Left side) (Role hypothesis: Gravity Controller)\n      Evidence: Located in the left perimeter slot. Indicates current gravity direction is LEFT.\n  - Obstacle Cluster: Color 3 (green) Irregular blobs (Role hypothesis: Static Terrain)\n      Evidence: Payload appears to be resting against the central green cluster, blocked from moving left.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Is the payload color consistent across stages (logs say Color 4, visuals show Grey/Color 5/8)?\n  - Do red background pixels adjacent to walls traverse differently?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Pink Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacle (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Bar (Active Shield): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Orange Block (Payload): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green Obstacle (Terrain): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Left Perimeter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Payload Block (Orange/Color 4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Goal Receptacle (Black/Color 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Active Shield (Pink/Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Confirmed that objects slide continuously in the direction of gravity until a solid collision occurs (Green obstacles act as solid walls).\n  - Confirmed that changing the shield position immediately resolves physics for all movable objects in the new direction.\n  - Confirmed: The Black U-shape (Color 0) is the Goal.\n  - Confirmed: Placing the Payload Block into the Goal triggers a Level Completion/Transition.\n  - Physics: Gravity applies immediately, causing falling objects to traverse open space until hitting a collider or goal.\n\nFRAME CHANGES (before → final state, pixel level):\nTotal: 432 pixels changed.

showing you a SEQUENCE of 10 LABELED images:\n1. IMAGE 1: Frame BEFORE the action\n2-10. IMAGEs 2-10: Animation frames showing the motion step by step\n\n⚠️ IMPORTANT: Analyze ALL animation frames to understand the FULL motion path!\nObjects may move multiple tiles - track their path through each frame.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!\n2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects\n3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context\n4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)\n5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect\n6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.\n7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.\n\nAnalyze what happened and provide your structured analysis."
