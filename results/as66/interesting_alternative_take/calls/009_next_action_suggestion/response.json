  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has 'NO OBSERVATIONS YET', making it the highest priority to test. Based on the previous actions (ACTION4=Right, ACTION2=Down) and the hypothesis of a Direct Directional Mapping (Up/Right/Down/Left), ACTION3 is expected to correspond to 'Left'. The current state has the shield at the Bottom, so if ACTION3 triggers a move to the Left, it will be clearly observable.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Confirm if ACTION3 is the 'Move Left' or 'Active Shield to Left' command, completing the mapping of the 4 cardinal directions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The Active Shield (Pink, Color 14) is currently located at the Bottom perimeter slot. The Top, Left, and Right slots are Inactive (Blue, Color 1). The internal arena contains green obstacles and a black U-shaped goal."
