Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state!

Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration.

ACTION1: \u2717 NO EFFECT - The action resulted in no visible changes to the game state....\n  2. ACTION4: \u2713 EFFECT - The action caused the Pink Rectangular Bar (Color 14), previ...\n  3. ACTION2: \u2713 EFFECT - The visible Pink Shield (Player) moved from the Right edge o...\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n\u26a0\ufe0f NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick green outer frame enclosing the play area. The inner edge of the frame contains 4 slots (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) that can be either Blue (Inactive) or Pink (Active).\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Single-screen enclosed square arena with a 4-directional perimeter control system. Internal area contains static obstacles and dynamic moving objects.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A perimeter-defense or guidance puzzle. The player controls the location of an 'Active Shield' (Pink) on the four walls of the arena. An autonomous object (Grey Block) moves inside the arena. The goal is likely to guide this object into the Black U-shaped receptacle and/or prevent it from hitting the 'Inactive' (Blue) walls or leaving the screen. The player must timely switch the shield's position to bounce or block the object as it moves through the obstacle course.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - Behavior of the Grey Block upon collision with Pink vs Blue walls.\n  - Function of the Orange dot.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Active Shield: Color 14 (pink) Horizontal/Vertical Bar (4x48 pixels) (Role hypothesis: player)\n      Evidence: Controlled by player actions. Only one exists at a time. Moves between the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left) based on input.\n  - Inactive Walls: Color 1 (blue) Horizontal/Vertical Bar (Role hypothesis: wall)\n      Evidence: Occupies the perimeter slots when the Active Shield is not present. Likely acts as a solid wall or a hazard.\n  - Goal / Receptacle: Color 0 (black) U-shaped structure (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Distinctive dark shape with an opening. Typical visual language for a container or target zone.\n  - Auto-Moving Block: Color 8 (grey) Small Square (4x4) (Role hypothesis: ball/payload)\n      Evidence: Observed moving autonomously (downwards) in the change logs. Distinct from static terrain.\n  - Collectible: Color 4 (orange) Small dot/cluster (Role hypothesis: collectible)\n      Evidence: Small, distinct color, placed inside/near obstacles. Likely to be collected.\n  - Turn Timer / Indicator: Color 13 (pink) Small horizontal dash (Role hypothesis: UI Element)\n      Evidence: Located at the top UI border, likely tracks remaining moves or turns.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the specific behavior of the Inactive (Blue) walls? Do they kill the object or just block it?\n  - Does the 'Auto-Moving Block' follow gravity (always falls down) or does it bounce?\n  - How do we interact with the Orange Collectible? Must the block touch it?\n  - Does the Pink Shield bounce the block?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The Black U-shape appears to be a static structure (Base) to be defended.\n  - Movement is restricted to the perimeter (Top, Right, Bottom, Left positions).\n  - The generic control scheme appears to be 'Direct Directional Mapping' (Up=Top, Right=Right, Down=Bottom, Left=Left).\n  - Evidence: Shield started at Top. ACTION1 (Up?) had no effect (already at Top). ACTION4 (Right) moved Top->Right. ACTION2 (Down) moved Right->Bottom.\n  - Internal objects (like the Grey Block) are dynamic and move during the action step (turn-based or time-step update).\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
