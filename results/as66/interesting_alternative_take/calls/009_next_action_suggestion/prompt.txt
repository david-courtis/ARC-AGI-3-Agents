=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

Current Stage: 1 (score: 0/254)
Actions in this stage: 4

ACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):
  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)
  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)
  ACTION3: Move LEFT (decrease column/x)
  ACTION4: Move RIGHT (increase column/x)

⚠️ NOTE: Only 4 actions are available in this game: ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move Active Shield to Top Perimeter
  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move Active Shield to Bottom Perimeter
  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move Active Shield to Right Perimeter

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))
  Description: Thick green outer frame enclosing the play area. The inner edge of the frame contains 4 slots (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) that can be either Blue (Inactive) or Pink (Active).

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Single-screen enclosed square arena with a 4-directional perimeter control system. Internal area contains static obstacles and dynamic moving objects.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A perimeter-defense or guidance puzzle. The player controls the location of an 'Active Shield' (Pink) on the four walls of the arena. An autonomous object (Grey Block) moves inside the arena. The goal is likely to guide this object into the Black U-shaped receptacle and/or prevent it from hitting the 'Inactive' (Blue) walls or leaving the screen. The player must timely switch the shield's position to bounce or block the object as it moves through the obstacle course.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.
  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).
  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).
  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).
  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - Behavior of the Grey Block upon collision with Pink vs Blue walls.
  - Function of the Orange dot.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).
  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.
  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.
  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.
  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles
  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Active Shield: Color 14 (pink) Horizontal/Vertical Bar (4x48 pixels) (Role hypothesis: player)
      Evidence: Controlled by player actions. Only one exists at a time. Moves between the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left) based on input.
  - Inactive Walls: Color 1 (blue) Horizontal/Vertical Bar (Role hypothesis: wall)
      Evidence: Occupies the perimeter slots when the Active Shield is not present. Likely acts as a solid wall or a hazard.
  - Goal / Receptacle: Color 0 (black) U-shaped structure (Role hypothesis: goal)
      Evidence: Distinctive dark shape with an opening. Typical visual language for a container or target zone.
  - Auto-Moving Block: Color 8 (grey) Small Square (4x4) (Role hypothesis: ball/payload)
      Evidence: Observed moving autonomously (downwards) in the change logs. Distinct from static terrain.
  - Collectible: Color 4 (orange) Small dot/cluster (Role hypothesis: collectible)
      Evidence: Small, distinct color, placed inside/near obstacles. Likely to be collected.
  - Turn Timer / Indicator: Color 13 (pink) Small horizontal dash (Role hypothesis: UI Element)
      Evidence: Located at the top UI border, likely tracks remaining moves or turns.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What is the specific behavior of the Inactive (Blue) walls? Do they kill the object or just block it?
  - Does the 'Auto-Moving Block' follow gravity (always falls down) or does it bounce?
  - How do we interact with the Orange Collectible? Must the block touch it?
  - Does the Pink Shield bounce the block?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - The Black U-shape appears to be a static structure (Base) to be defended.
  - Movement is restricted to the perimeter (Top, Right, Bottom, Left positions).
  - The generic control scheme appears to be 'Direct Directional Mapping' (Up=Top, Right=Right, Down=Bottom, Left=Left).
  - Evidence: Shield started at Top. ACTION1 (Up?) had no effect (already at Top). ACTION4 (Right) moved Top->Right. ACTION2 (Down) moved Right->Bottom.
  - Internal objects (like the Grey Block) are dynamic and move during the action step (turn-based or time-step update).

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action
