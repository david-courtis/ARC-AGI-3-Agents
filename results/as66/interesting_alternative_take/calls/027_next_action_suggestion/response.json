  "target_action": "ACTION2",

  "reasoning": "The payload (Grey Block) is currently positioned in the upper-middle section, to the left of the central obstacle. The Goal (Black U-shape) is in the bottom-left corner with its opening facing Right. To solve the level, the payload needs to be lowered to align vertically with the goal opening. ACTION2 (Gravity Down) should slide the payload down to the bottom wall. Since the payload is to the right of the goal horizontally, once it is at the bottom, a subsequent Left move should slide it into the goal. Additionally, ACTION2 needs one more consistent observation to be fully verified (currently 2/3).",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify that ACTION2 successfully moves the Shield to the Bottom perimeter and applies downward gravity, causing the payload to slide to the bottom of the arena.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Stage 2. Shield is on the Right wall (Gravity Right). Payload is resting against the left side of the central green obstacle. Logic suggests the path downwards is clear. Recent history shows ACTION1 (Up) had no effect, possibly due to unseen obstruction or state logic, so moving Down is the logical alternative to progress."
