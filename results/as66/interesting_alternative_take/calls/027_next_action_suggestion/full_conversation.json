If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick green outer frame (approx 4px) surrounding the entire play area. Inside this frame is a 1-unit wide track for the 'Shield'.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based arena bounded by a gravity-control track. Interior contains static green obstacles and a specific goal zone. The layout requires navigating the payload around obstacles by switching gravity direction.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A gravity-manipulation puzzle game. The player controls a 'Gravity Shield' on the perimeter of the arena. Moving the shield changes the direction of gravity for the internal payload object (sokoban-style sliding). The objective is to sustain a sequence of gravity shifts to navigate the payload around static obstacles and into a specific goal receptacle.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).\n  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).\n  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - Top UI border (magenta pixels)\n  - Bottom UI border (yellow bar)\n  - Precise collision bounding box of the goal receptacle\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.\n  - Green terrain blocks movement.\n  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.\n  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.\n  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.\n  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - Diagonal movement is not observed.\n  - Payload blocked by Green obstacles.\n  - Payload currently pinned against the right side of the central obstacle due to Leftward gravity.\n  - Perimeter walls block exit.\n  - Payload physics are 'slide until collision' (ice physics).\n  - Green (Color 3) internal terrain blocks movement.\n  - Perimeter walls (Blue/Green) block movement.\n  - Goal walls (Black) likely block movement from the wrong direction (must enter open side).\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.\n  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries\n  - Color 3 (green) central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) top-left small cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) bottom-right small cluster\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as walls\n  - Color 3 (green) large central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) smaller peripheral clusters (top-left, bottom-right)\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments (Top, Left, Bottom currently)\n  - Color 14 (pink) active perimeter segment (Right currently)\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Payload Block Stage 2: Color 11 (grey) Small square (approx 4x4 pixels) (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Moveable Object)\n      Evidence: It is the only object that changed position relative to the internal terrain after the gravity shift. It is distinct from the background and static obstacles.\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) C-shaped / U-shaped cup, opening faces Right (Role hypothesis: Goal)\n      Evidence: Distinct black shape with a clear 'opening'. The gameplay loop implies moving the payload into a specific target.\n  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Rectangular bar along one perimeter edge (Role hypothesis: Gravity Controller)\n      Evidence: Moves based on player input Action 4 (Right). Its position correlates with the direction the payload slides (Shield on Right -> Payload slides Right).\n  - Static Terrain: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters (Role hypothesis: Obstacle / Wall)\n      Evidence: The payload stopped moving exactly when it collided with the central green cluster, proving these green pixels are solid.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Does the payload need to stop *inside* the goal, or just touch it?\n  - What is the function of the magenta pixels/dashes at the very top edge of the screen?\n  - Is the yellow bar at the bottom a progress bar or just decoration?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Pink Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacle (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Bar (Active Shield): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Orange Block (Payload): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green Obstacle (Terrain): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Left Perimeter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Payload Block (Orange/Color 4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Goal Receptacle (Black/Color 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Active Shield (Pink/Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Payload Block (Color 11): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Green Obstacles (Color 3): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Perimeter: Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Confirmed: The Black U-shape (Color 0) is the Goal.\n  - Confirmed: Placing the Payload Block into the Goal triggers a Level Completion/Transition.\n  - Physics: Gravity applies immediately, causing falling objects to traverse open space until hitting a collider or goal.\n  - Confirmed: The payload object in Stage 2 is Color 11 (Grey/Light Blue), whereas it was Color 4 (Orange) in Stage 1.\n  - Confirmed: Physics allows objects to slide across the entire width of the arena in a single turn if unobstructed.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
