  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 needs one more observation to be fully verified (currently 2/3). The payload is currently resting against an obstacle to its right. Visually, the path directly ABOVE the payload appears clear for a significant distance before hitting the upper section of the central green cluster. Therefore, switching gravity to UP (ACTION1) should cause the payload to slide upwards, confirming the 'Gravity Up' mechanic and completing verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect the Pink Shield to move to the Top position and the Grey Payload to slide UP from its current position until it collides with the upper section of the central green obstacle. This will confirm the vertical gravity mechanics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The payload is stable, resting against a green block that stopped its rightward movement. The goal is to the left, but we prioritize verifying ACTION1. The space above the payload looks open, making this a good state to test vertical movement."
