  "reasoning": "The most recent action (ACTION1) had no effect, confirming the shield is already at the Top position. To explore consistently, we must change the shield's position to trigger a new gravity state. ACTION4 (Move Right) has the lowest verification score (0/3 consistent observations) and has not been thoroughly tested. The Orange Block appears to have a clear path to the right, which will allow us to clearly observe the 'Gravity Right' mechanics and verify if the block slides until it hits the boundary.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect the Pink Shield to move from the Top to the Right perimeter slot. Simultaneously, we expect the Orange Block to detach from the green overhang and slide to the far right of the arena. This will provide a second data point for verifying ACTION4 and confirm the sliding physics of the payload.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The active Pink Shield is at the Top. The Orange Payload is trapped vertically against the bottom of a Green Obstacle structure due to the current Upward gravity. There is open space to the right of the payload, making a Rightward gravity shift (ACTION4) an ideal test case."
