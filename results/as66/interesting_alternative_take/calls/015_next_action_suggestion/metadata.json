  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: Gravity UP: Move Shield to Top. Applies upward force to internal objects.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Gravity DOWN: Move Shield to Bottom. Applies downward force to internal objects.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move LEFT: Relocates the Active Shield to the Left perimeter slot and applies a leftward force/movement to dynamic internal objects.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Gravity RIGHT: Move Shield to Right. Applies rightward force to internal objects.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick green outer frame with 4 interactive slots on the perimeter (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  64x64 Grid. Gravity-based puzzle. Terrain consists of Green obstacles. One specific Orange block is the dynamic payload.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A gravity-manipulation puzzle where the player moves a 'Shield' (Pink Bar) around the perimeter of the square arena. The Shield acts as a gravity attractor, pulling the internal Payload (Orange Block) towards the wall where the Shield is active. The goal is to maneuver the Payload around Green obstacles and into the Black Goal receptacle by switching gravity limits.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The precise interaction trigger for the goal.\n  - The thin pink UI line at y=0.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Rectangular Bar (48x4) (Role hypothesis: player / gravity controller)\n      Evidence: Controlled by player actions; its position determines the direction of gravity (attractor).\n  - Payload Block: Color 4 (orange) Small Square (4x4) (Role hypothesis: payload / character)\n      Evidence: This object is the only dynamic element inside the arena. Previous analysis identified a 'Grey Block (Color 8)' but visual evidence suggests the 'Payload' is actually this Orange block, which is currently resting in a position that explains the blocked movement (trapped under a green overhang).\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) U-shaped structure (Role hypothesis: goal)\n      Evidence: Distinct black receptor shape, likely the target for the payload.\n  - Inactive Wall: Color 1 (blue) Rectangular Bar (Role hypothesis: wall)\n      Evidence: Occupies the perimeter slots when the Active Shield is elsewhere.\n  - Turn Timer / UI: Color 14 (pink) Thin line/dash (Role hypothesis: UI Element)\n      Evidence: Located at the very top edge, seemingly outside the play area.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Does the payload need to stop specifically inside the U-shape, or just touch it?\n  - Does the game end immediately upon reaching the goal?\n  - What is the exact function of the top UI line?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Pink Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Movement Physics: The internal block moves continuously (multiple steps per turn) in the active direction until obstructed.\n  - Control Scheme Validation: Action 3 is confirmed as 'Left', completing the directional set (Up=1/Null, Down=2, Left=3, Right=4).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Action 1 = Top Wall / Up Gravity.\n  - Confirmed absolute positioning: Input determines specific wall, not relative rotation.\n  - Physics Constraint: Internal objects do not move if their path in the strictly new gravity direction is immediately blocked by terrain.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",
