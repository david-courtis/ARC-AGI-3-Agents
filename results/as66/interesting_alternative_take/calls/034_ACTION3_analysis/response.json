  "interpretation": "The player executed ACTION3 (Left). This moved the Active Pink Shield from the Top perimeter slot to the Left perimeter slot, switching the gravity direction to 'Left'. The internal Grey Payload (Color 11) slid leftward across the floor. Upon reaching the Left perimeter (now occupied by the Active Shield), it utilized the Shield as a 'Screen Wrap Portal', passing through the boundary and reappearing on the Right edge of the playfield. It continued moving leftward from the right edge until it collided with a small Green Obstacle (Color 3) at row 48, where it came to rest.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The Active Shield was moved to the Left, creating an open 'gate' in the perimeter wall. The payload's path to the left was unobstructed until the wall. Because the wall was 'Active' (Pink), the collision logic triggered a screen wrap instead of a stop. The payload wrapped to the opposite side (Right) and continued moving under the leftward gravity until hitting a static internal obstacle.",
