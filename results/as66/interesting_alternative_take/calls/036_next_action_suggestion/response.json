  "reasoning": "ACTION4 (Right Gravity) is currently at 2/3 consistent observations and needs one more to be VERIFIED. The current board state shows the active pink shield on the Left (Gravity Left), and the grey payload resting against the right side of a green obstacle cluster in the bottom-right quadrant. This implies the payload was pulled Left until it hit the barrier. Consequently, the path to the RIGHT (away from the obstacle) appears clear of immediate obstructions. Switching gravity to the Right (ACTION4) should cause the payload to slide rightward, providing the distinct movement required to verify the action.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify ACTION4 by observing the payload slide from its current resting position towards the right perimeter wall, confirming consistent behavior for 'Right Gravity' and 'Shield Right'.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The active Pink Shield is on the Left perimeter. The Grey Payload (Color 11) is pinned against the right face of a small Green obstacle in the bottom-right area. The path to the right of the payload is clear up to the Blue perimeter wall."
