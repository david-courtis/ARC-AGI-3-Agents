Applies rightward force to internal objects.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick Green (Color 3) outer frame (approx 4px) surrounding the play area. Just inside this frame are 4 'slots' for the perimeter walls/shields.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  2D Grid with Conditional Toroidal Topology. The grid wraps locally in the direction of the Active Shield, but behaves as a bounded box in other directions.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A sliding-block puzzle game featuring 'Rotational Gravity' and 'Screen Wrapping'. The player moves a 'Gravity Shield' around the perimeter. This shield serves two purposes: determining the direction of gravity (pulling the payload) and acting as a portal that allows the payload to wrap around the screen. Inactive sides act as solid walls. The goal is to slide a payload block into a specific target receptacle by manipulating gravity and using obstacles to align the path.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).\n  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).\n  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.\n  - Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.\n  - Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.\n  - Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.\n  - Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.\n  - CONFIRMED WRAP MECHANIC: The 'Active Shield' (Pink) functions as a portal. Objects do not stop at the shield; they pass through and wrap to the opposite side of the screen.\n  - TOROIDAL TOPOLOGY: The playfield effectively becomes a cylinder in the direction of the active gravity.\n  - NON-EUCLIDEAN MOVEMENT: 'Gravity Up' can result in the object appearing lower on the screen due to wrapping from Top to Bottom.\n  - GRAVITY CONFIRMATION: Gravity pulls towards the Pink Shield. (Shield Top = Gravity Up).\n  - CONFIRMED SCREEN WRAPPING: The Pink Shield allows the payload to exit the screen and re-enter from the opposite side. Evidence: Coordinate change from (48, 28) to (48, 48) under Left Gravity is only possible via a wrap.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - Properties of the Black Goal walls (are they solid?)\n  - Exact behavior if a wrapped object reappears inside an obstacle (likely impossible by level design)\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.\n  - Green terrain blocks movement.\n  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.\n  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.\n  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.\n  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - Diagonal movement is not observed.\n  - Payload blocked by Green obstacles.\n  - Payload currently pinned against the right side of the central obstacle due to Leftward gravity.\n  - Perimeter walls block exit.\n  - Payload physics are 'slide until collision' (ice physics).\n  - Green (Color 3) internal terrain blocks movement.\n  - Perimeter walls (Blue/Green) block movement.\n  - Goal walls (Black) likely block movement from the wrong direction (must enter open side).\n  - Payload slides continuously in the direction of gravity until blocked.\n  - Gravity direction is determined by the position of the Pink Shield (Bottom = Down).\n  - Green obstacles (Color 3) are solid and block movement/support the payload.\n  - Perimeter walls block movement.\n  - Payload must enter Goal from the open side (Right).\n  - Payload slides continuously in the direction of the Pink Shield.\n  - Green (Color 3) and Blue (Color 1) objects are SOLID and block movement.\n  - Pink (Color 14) Shield is PERMEABLE and allows SCREEN WRAPPING.\n  - Wrapping preserves momentum: exiting Top -> entering Bottom -> continuing Up.\n  - Green (Color 3) terrain blocks movement.\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter walls block movement.\n  - Pink (Color 14) perimeter shield ALLOWS movement (wrapping).\n  - Movement is continuous 'sliding' until collision or wrap.\n  -

Just inside this frame are 4 'slots' for the perimeter walls/shields.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  2D Grid with Conditional Toroidal Topology. The grid wraps locally in the direction of the Active Shield, but behaves as a bounded box in other directions.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A sliding-block puzzle game featuring 'Rotational Gravity' and 'Screen Wrapping'. The player moves a 'Gravity Shield' around the perimeter. This shield serves two purposes: determining the direction of gravity (pulling the payload) and acting as a portal that allows the payload to wrap around the screen. Inactive sides act as solid walls. The goal is to slide a payload block into a specific target receptacle by manipulating gravity and using obstacles to align the path.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).\n  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).\n  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.\n  - Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.\n  - Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.\n  - Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.\n  - Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.\n  - CONFIRMED WRAP MECHANIC: The 'Active Shield' (Pink) functions as a portal. Objects do not stop at the shield; they pass through and wrap to the opposite side of the screen.\n  - TOROIDAL TOPOLOGY: The playfield effectively becomes a cylinder in the direction of the active gravity.\n  - NON-EUCLIDEAN MOVEMENT: 'Gravity Up' can result in the object appearing lower on the screen due to wrapping from Top to Bottom.\n  - GRAVITY CONFIRMATION: Gravity pulls towards the Pink Shield. (Shield Top = Gravity Up).\n  - CONFIRMED SCREEN WRAPPING: The Pink Shield allows the payload to exit the screen and re-enter from the opposite side. Evidence: Coordinate change from (48, 28) to (48, 48) under Left Gravity is only possible via a wrap.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - Properties of the Black Goal walls (are they solid?)\n  - Exact behavior if a wrapped object reappears inside an obstacle (likely impossible by level design)\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  -

Payload is currently resting against the right face of a green block after leftward gravity.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Does the payload stop immediately upon entering the goal, or must it hit the back wall of the goal?\n  - Is the goal 'solid' from the outside (e.g. hitting the top/bottom/left of the black 'C' shape)?\n  - Does wrapping preserve exact intercept coordinates or is there a shift?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Pink Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green/Orange Obstacle (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Pink Bar (Active Shield): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Orange Block (Payload): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Green Obstacle (Terrain): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Left Perimeter: Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Payload Block (Orange/Color 4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Goal Receptacle (Black/Color 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Active Shield (Pink/Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Grey Payload Block (Color 11): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Green Obstacles (Color 3): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Right Perimeter: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Green Obstacle (Color 3): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Active Gravity Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Payload Block (Color 11): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Grey Payload (Color 11): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Inactive Blue borders function as solid walls that prevent wrapping.\n  - Objects wrap to the opposite edge and continue moving in the direction of gravity until blocked by an internal obstacle.\n  - CONFIRMED: The 'Active Shield' permits horizontal screen wrapping (Left <-> Right) in addition to vertical wrapping.\n  - The payload maintains its row (Y-coordinate) during a horizontal wrap.\n  - Internal obstacles (Color 3) effectively catch wrapped objects.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION2, ACTION3\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 (Right Gravity) is currently at 2/3 consistent observations and needs one more to be VERIFIED. The current board state shows the active pink shield on the Left (Gravity Left), and the grey payload resting against the right side of a green obstacle cluster in the bottom-right quadrant. This implies the payload was pulled Left until it hit the barrier. Consequently, the path to the RIGHT (away from the obstacle) appears clear of immediate obstructions. Switching gravity to the Right (ACTION4) should cause the payload to slide rightward, providing the distinct movement required to verify the action.",
