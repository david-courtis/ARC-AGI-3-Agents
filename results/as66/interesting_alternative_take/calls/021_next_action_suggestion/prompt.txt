=== SYSTEM ===
You are a game exploration strategist.

Your goal is to systematically learn what each action does in an unknown game.
You do this by choosing which action to test next based on:

1. Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)
2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)
3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action

An action is "verified" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.

CRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again
in the same state! Instead:
1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position
2. Then test the action from the new position
3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)

If the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when
testing movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a
SETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.

Be strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to
discover context-dependent behaviors.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))
  Description: A thick green outer frame enclosing the play area. Inside this frame is a secondary track containing the 4 directional slots for the shield/gravity controller.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  64x64 Grid containing a gravity-based maze. The play area is bounded by a controller track. Inside, green obstacles form a maze that the orange block must navigate through gravity manipulation.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A gravity-manipulation puzzle where the player controls the direction of 'down' by moving a cursor (Shield) around the perimeter of the screen. The goal is to guide a sliding block (Orange) through a maze of static obstacles (Green) into a target receptacle (Black U-shape). The mechanics mimic 'rotational gravity' or 'sliding block' puzzles.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.
  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).
  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).
  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).
  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.
  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).
  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.
  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.
  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.
  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).
  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.
  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.
  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.
  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.
  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.
  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.
  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The distinct yellow line at the bottom of the screen (color not standard in palette descriptions).
  - The precise interaction logic with the goal (Color 0 U-shape).

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).
  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.
  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.
  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.
  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.
  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.
  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.
  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).
  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.
  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.
  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.
  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.
  - Green terrain blocks movement.
  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.
  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.
  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.
  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.
  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.
  - Diagonal movement is not observed.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles
  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles
  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain
  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls
  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles
  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls
  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.
  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.
  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain
  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Rectangular Bar (vertical) (Role hypothesis: Gravity Controller)
      Evidence: Its position dictates the direction of gravity. When on the Left (current), the payload slides Left. It moves between perimeter slots.
  - Inactive Shield Slot: Color 1 (blue) Rectangular Bar (Role hypothesis: Passive Boundary)
      Evidence: Fills the perimeter slots not occupied by the Active Shield. Blocks movement out of bounds.
  - Payload Block: Color 4 (orange) Small Square (approx 4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Moving Object)
      Evidence: This object moves in response to the Shield's position. It just slid to the left when the Shield moved to the Left. (Note: Automated logs incorrectly identify this as Color 8, but visual evidence confirms Orange/Color 4).
  - Terrain Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters (Role hypothesis: Static Wall)
      Evidence: The Payload Block stopped moving precisely when it collided with the vertical edge of this green cluster.
  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) U-shape / Cup (Role hypothesis: Goal)
      Evidence: A distinct receptacle shape located in the lower area, distinguished from the solid green walls.
  - Progress/Info Bar: Yellow Line (Role hypothesis: UI Element)
      Evidence: A single colored line across the very bottom of the view, likely indicated status or boundary.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - Does the payload need to settle INSIDE the 'cup' of importance (requiring Down gravity to enter) or just touch it?
  - What is the Yellow bar at the bottom indicating?
  - Are there any hazardous blocks that reset the level?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 0 (Black U-shape, Player): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Pink Bar (Color 14): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Top Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Right Border Area: Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Pink Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Blue Inactive Wall (Color 1): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Grey Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Top UI Indicator (Color 13): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Pink Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Green/Orange Obstacles (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Active Shield (Color 14): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Payload Block (Color 8): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Green Obstacle Structure (Color 3): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Green/Orange Obstacle (Color 3/4): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Pink Bar (Active Shield): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Orange Block (Payload): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Green Obstacle (Terrain): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Left Perimeter: Involved in ACTION3 action

Recent Observations:
  - Confirmed Color 8 (Grey Block) is a dynamic object affected by gravity (contradicting the hint that Color 4 is the only payload, or indicating multiple payload types).
  - Physics Confirmation: Objects slide continuously (multiple steps per turn) in the direction of gravity until obstructed.
  - Confirmed ACTION3 maps to 'Left' gravity/shield position.
  - Confirmed that objects slide continuously in the direction of gravity until a solid collision occurs (Green obstacles act as solid walls).
  - Confirmed that changing the shield position immediately resolves physics for all movable objects in the new direction.

VERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None
PENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4

RECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts

Looking at the current game state (image shown), decide:
1. Which action should we test next?
2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?
3. Why this choice?

CRITICAL RULES:
- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first
- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again
- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position
- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action
