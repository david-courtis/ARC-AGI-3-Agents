  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "The current state results from ACTION3 (Gravity Left), which successfully moved the shield to the left and slid the payload against a wall. The goal (black U-shape) is located below the payload. Testing ACTION2 (Gravity Down) is the logical next step to solve the puzzle, as the path below the payload appears to be clear of obstacles. This also serves to verify ACTION2 which currently has low verification (1/3).",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify that ACTION2 moves the Pink Shield to the bottom perimeter and applies downward gravity, causing the Orange payload to slide down towards the goal.",
  "current_board_assessment": "Shield is on the Left. Payload (Orange Block) is stopped against a green obstacle to its left but appears unsupported from below. Goal is in the lower-left quadrant. Gravity Down is the optimal move."
