  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION1.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION1:\n\"Gravity UP: Move Shield to Top. Applies upward force to internal objects.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (2 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT\n      Context: The player is positioned at the bottom of a bounded playfield (Color 15/F background), facing upward towards green shape clusters (Color 3). The environment is static.\n      Interpretation: The action resulted in no visible changes to the game state. The player character (black U-shape at the bottom) remained in its position at row 53, and no projectiles or movement occurred. Given the game's visual similarity to a fixed shooter (e.g., Space Invaders) or paddle game (Avatar at bottom, enemies/obstacles above), vertical movement is likely restricted or disabled by the game rules.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The player is navigating a payload through a maze using directional gravity. The Shield moved from Left -> Top. The payload remained pinned under an obstacle.\n      Interpretation: The action activated the 'Top' perimeter shield, moving the visible Pink Bar from the Left edge to the Top edge. This corresponds to setting the gravitational pull to 'Up'. However, the internal Grey Block (payload) did not move upwards, likely because it is positioned directly beneath an overhang of the green obstacle structure, preventing vertical movement in that direction.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick green outer frame (approx 4px) containing the play area. A designated 1-unit wide track for the 'Shield' runs just inside this frame.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based puzzle arena. Central space contains strategic arrangement of Green obstacles. The obstacles are placed to act as 'stops' to align the sliding payload with the goal coordinates.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  Gravity-sliding puzzle game. The player controls a 'Gravity Shield' on the perimeter of the arena. Moving the shield changes the direction of gravity (e.g., Shield at Bottom = Gravity Down). The goal is to slide a payload block into a specific receptacle (Goal) by manipulating gravity to navigate around obstacles and use walls to align the path. Physics are 'ice-sliding' style: objects move until they hit a wall.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).\n  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).\n  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.\n  - Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.\n  - Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.\n  - Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.\n  - Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - Top UI strip (Purple)\n  - Bottom UI strip (Yellow)\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.\n  - Green terrain blocks movement.\n  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.\n  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.\n  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.\n  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - Diagonal movement is not observed.\n  - Payload blocked by Green obstacles.\n  - Payload currently pinned against the right side of the central obstacle due to Leftward gravity.\n  - Perimeter walls block exit.\n  - Payload physics are 'slide until collision' (ice physics).\n  - Green (Color 3) internal terrain blocks movement.\n  - Perimeter walls (Blue/Green) block movement.\n  - Goal walls (Black) likely block movement from the wrong direction (must enter open side).\n  - Payload slides continuously in the direction of gravity until blocked.\n  - Gravity direction is determined by the position of the Pink Shield (Bottom = Down).\n  - Green obstacles (Color 3) are solid and block movement/support the payload.\n  - Perimeter walls block movement.\n  - Payload must enter Goal from the open side (Right).\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.\n  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries\n  - Color 3 (green) central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) top-left small cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) bottom-right small cluster\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as walls\n  - Color 3 (green) large central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) smaller peripheral clusters (top-left, bottom-right)\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments (Top, Left, Bottom currently)\n  - Color 14 (pink) active perimeter segment (Right currently)\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as obstacles and platforms\n  - Color 3 (green) central large cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) smaller isolated blocks acting as 'catchers' for the payload\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as solid walls\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Payload Block: Color 11 (grey) Small square (4x4 pixels) (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Moveable Object)\n      Evidence: Moved vertically down in response to ACTION2 (Gravity Down). Is currently resting on top of a green obstacle.\n  - Active Gravity Shield: Color 14 (pink) Rectangular bar (48x4 pixels) (Role hypothesis: Gravity Controller)\n      Evidence: Moved to the bottom edge after ACTION2. Its position correlates with the downward movement of the payload.\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) C-shaped / U-shaped cup, opening faces Right (Role hypothesis: Goal)\n      Evidence: Distinctive shape located on the left side. The payload has been maneuvered to align vertically with its opening.\n  - Alignment Platform: Color 3 (green) Small rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Obstacle / Support)\n      Evidence: The payload fell and stopped exactly when it hit this object, which is positioned to alien the payload with the Goal.\n  - Inactive Track: Color 1 (blue) Rectangular bars on perimeter (Role hypothesis: Wall / Boundary)\n      Evidence: Occupies the perimeter slots where the Active Shield is not present.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - Does the payload need to trigger a specific event inside the goal, or just overlap?\n  - What is the function of the yellow bar at the bottom screen edge?

Applies upward force to internal objects.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS FOR THIS ACTION (2 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT\n      Context: The player is positioned at the bottom of a bounded playfield (Color 15/F background), facing upward towards green shape clusters (Color 3). The environment is static.\n      Interpretation: The action resulted in no visible changes to the game state. The player character (black U-shape at the bottom) remained in its position at row 53, and no projectiles or movement occurred. Given the game's visual similarity to a fixed shooter (e.g., Space Invaders) or paddle game (Avatar at bottom, enemies/obstacles above), vertical movement is likely restricted or disabled by the game rules.\n  [2] HAD EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The player is navigating a payload through a maze using directional gravity. The Shield moved from Left -> Top. The payload remained pinned under an obstacle.\n      Interpretation: The action activated the 'Top' perimeter shield, moving the visible Pink Bar from the Left edge to the Top edge. This corresponds to setting the gravitational pull to 'Up'. However, the internal Grey Block (payload) did not move upwards, likely because it is positioned directly beneath an overhang of the green obstacle structure, preventing vertical movement in that direction.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green))\n  Description: Thick green outer frame (approx 4px) containing the play area. A designated 1-unit wide track for the 'Shield' runs just inside this frame.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based puzzle arena. Central space contains strategic arrangement of Green obstacles. The obstacles are placed to act as 'stops' to align the sliding payload with the goal coordinates.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  Gravity-sliding puzzle game. The player controls a 'Gravity Shield' on the perimeter of the arena. Moving the shield changes the direction of gravity (e.g., Shield at Bottom = Gravity Down). The goal is to slide a payload block into a specific receptacle (Goal) by manipulating gravity to navigate around obstacles and use walls to align the path. Physics are 'ice-sliding' style: objects move until they hit a wall.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n  - The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n  - Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n  - Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n  - The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n  - CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n  - SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n  - DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n  - CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n  - Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n  - Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n  - Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n  - Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n  - Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n  - Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n  - Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n  - Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n  - Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n  - STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n  - INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n  - GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n  - PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n  - Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).\n  - Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).\n  - Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.\n  - Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.\n  - Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.\n  - Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.\n  - Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - Top UI strip (Purple)\n  - Bottom UI strip (Yellow)\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Player (Shield) constrained to the perimeter slots (Top, Right, Down, Left).\n  - Shield rotates between these 4 fixed positions rather than moving continuously.\n  - Player (Shield) restricts movement to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - The Active Shield CANNOT enter the central play area.\n  - Internal objects (Color 8) appear to move freely or under gravity/physics within the arena.\n  - Payload (Grey Block) slides in the direction of the Active Shield until it hits a wall or obstacle.\n  - Payload cannot pass through Green clusters.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 perimeter slots (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).\n  - Payload cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Shield (Gravity Source) until blocked.\n  - Active Shield is constrained to the 4 perimeter slots.\n  - Payload slides in the direction of the Active Gravity Controller (Pink Bar) until blocked.\n  - Green terrain blocks movement.\n  - Outer perimeter blocks movement.\n  - Movement is continuous (sliding) until collision, not step-by-step.\n  - Payload slides continuously in the cardinal direction of the Active Pink Shield.\n  - Payload stops only when hitting a Green Obstacle or the Perimeter Wall.\n  - Active Shield is restricted to the 4 cardinal perimeter slots.\n  - Diagonal movement is not observed.\n  - Payload blocked by Green obstacles.\n  - Payload currently pinned against the right side of the central obstacle due to Leftward gravity.\n  - Perimeter walls block exit.\n  - Payload physics are 'slide until collision' (ice physics).\n  - Green (Color 3) internal terrain blocks movement.\n  - Perimeter walls (Blue/Green) block movement.\n  - Goal walls (Black) likely block movement from the wrong direction (must enter open side).\n  - Payload slides continuously in the direction of gravity until blocked.\n  - Gravity direction is determined by the position of the Pink Shield (Bottom = Down).\n  - Green obstacles (Color 3) are solid and block movement/support the payload.\n  - Perimeter walls block movement.\n  - Payload must enter Goal from the open side (Right).\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Blue (Color 1) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as boundary walls\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters act as static terrain blocks.\n  - Green (Color 3) U-shaped structures or corners act as obstacles.\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as static terrain\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as boundaries\n  - Color 3 (green) central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) top-left small cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) bottom-right small cluster\n  - Color 1 (blue) perimeter segments acting as walls\n  - Color 3 (green) large central irregular cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) smaller peripheral clusters (top-left, bottom-right)\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments (Top, Left, Bottom currently)\n  - Color 14 (pink) active perimeter segment (Right currently)\n  - Color 3 (green) irregular clusters acting as obstacles and platforms\n  - Color 3 (green) central large cluster\n  - Color 3 (green) smaller isolated blocks acting as 'catchers' for the payload\n  - Color 1 (blue) inactive perimeter segments acting as solid walls\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Payload Block: Color 11 (grey) Small square (4x4 pixels) (Role hypothesis: Player Character / Moveable Object)\n      Evidence: Moved vertically down in response to ACTION2 (Gravity Down).

showing you a SEQUENCE of 12 LABELED images:\n1. IMAGE 1: Frame BEFORE the action\n2-12. IMAGEs 2-12: Animation frames showing the motion step by step\n\n⚠️ IMPORTANT: Analyze ALL animation frames to understand the FULL motion path!\nObjects may move multiple tiles - track their path through each frame.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!\n2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects\n3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context\n4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)\n5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect\n6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.\n7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.\n\nAnalyze what happened and provide your structured analysis."
