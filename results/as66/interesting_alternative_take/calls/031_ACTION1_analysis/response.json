  "interpretation": "The action moved the Active Pink Shield to the Top perimeter, setting the gravity direction to UP. The Grey Payload (Color 11) 'fell' upwards. Critically, instead of stopping when it reached the Top edge (where the Active Shield was located), it passed through the boundary and wrapped around to the Bottom of the playfield (Screen Wrap). It continued moving upwards from the bottom edge until it collided with the underside of a central Green Obstacle, where it came to rest.",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "Gravity UP / Wrap Gate: Moves the Active Shield to the Top position and sets global gravity to UP. The Active Shield acts as a permeable gateway, allowing moving objects to WRAP around the screen (e.g., exit Top -> enter Bottom) while maintaining their momentum. Inactive (Blue) walls remain solid.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": true,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The path between the payload and the Top Shield was completely unobstructed. Previous attempts to move UP were blocked by obstacles immediately above the payload. The 'Active Shield' acts as a hole in the perimeter wall, enabling the screen-wrap mechanic observed here.",

    "Objects wrap to the opposite edge and continue moving in the direction of gravity until blocked by an internal obstacle."
