BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

This moved the Active Pink Shield from the Top perimeter slot to\nEvidence Status: STATE CHANGE OBSERVED - Use this as evidence!\n\nRECENT CHANGES OBSERVED (THIS IS EVIDENCE!):\nTotal: 432 pixels changed. Regions affected: upper_left_playarea (192), lower_left_playarea (112), upper_right_playarea (96), top_ui (16), lower_right_playarea (16) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-55], cols [0-62]\n\nObject-level changes: APPEARED: 2 objects\n  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)\n  + Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 48)\nDISAPPEARED: 2 objects\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8)\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)\n\n\n=== ACTION ANALYSIS INSIGHTS (from previous LLM analysis of this action) ===\nFull Interpretation: The player executed ACTION3 (Left). This moved the Active Pink Shield from the Top perimeter slot to the Left perimeter slot, switching the gravity direction to 'Left'. The internal Grey Payload (Color 11) slid leftward across the floor. Upon reaching the Left perimeter (now occupied by the Active Shield), it utilized the Shield as a 'Screen Wrap Portal', passing through the boundary and reappearing on the Right edge of the playfield. It continued moving leftward from the right edge until it collided with a small Green Obstacle (Color 3) at row 48, where it came to rest.\nWhy This Outcome: The Active Shield was moved to the Left, creating an open 'gate' in the perimeter wall. The payload's path to the left was unobstructed until the wall. Because the wall was 'Active' (Pink), the collision logic triggered a screen wrap instead of a stop. The payload wrapped to the opposite side (Right) and continued moving under the leftward gravity until hitting a static internal obstacle.\nEnvironment Updates Discovered:\n  - CONFIRMED: The 'Active Shield' permits horizontal screen wrapping (Left <-> Right) in addition to vertical wrapping.\n  - The payload maintains its row (Y-coordinate) during a horizontal wrap.\n  - Internal obstacles (Color 3) effectively catch wrapped objects.\nObjects Involved: Pink Shield (Color 14), Grey Payload (Color 11), Green Obstacle (Color 3)\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above insights were discovered by analyzing the action's effect.\nUse these insights to UPDATE your environment understanding!\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING (MAY BE WRONG - UPDATE IF NEEDED):\nBackground: Color 9 (dark red/brown)\nBorder: Yes (Color 3 (green)) - Thick Green (Color 3) outer frame (approx 4px) surrounding the play area. Just inside this frame are 4 'slots' for the perimeter walls/shields.\nInternal walls/obstacles:\n  - Green (Color 3) clusters act as internal terrain/obstacles\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular clusters acting as terrain/obstacles\n  -

Green (Color 3) and Blue (Color 1) objects are SOLID and block movement.\n  - Pink (Color 14) Shield is PERMEABLE and allows SCREEN WRAPPING.\n  - Wrapping preserves momentum: exiting Top -> entering Bottom -> continuing Up.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Payload Block: Color 11 (grey) 4x4 pixel square (Role: Player Character / Dynamic Object)\n  - Active Shield / Gravity Gate: Color 14 (pink) 48x4 pixel rectangular bar (Role: Gravity Controller & Portal)\n  - Inactive Wall: Color 1 (blue) 48x4 pixel rectangular bar (Role: Solid Boundary)\n  - Goal Receptacle: Color 0 (black) C-shaped cup opening to the Right (Role: Goal)\n  - Internal Obstacles: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters (Role: Static Terrain)\nSpatial structure: Grid-based arena with toroidal (wrapping) topology along the axis of the Active Shield.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- The game mechanic is a 'Perimeter Defense' or 'Rotational Shield' system.\n- The player controls which of the 4 walls is 'Active' (Pink/Color 14). The other walls remain 'Inactive' (Blue/Color 1).\n- Action 4 rotates the active shield position Clockwise (Top -> Right).\n- Confirmed Control Scheme: Direct Directional Mapping. Action 1=Top, Action 2=Bottom, Action 4=Right. (Action 3 is inferred to be Left).\n- The 'Active Shield' replaces the 'Inactive Wall' at the target location, swapping states.\n- CONFIRMED GRAVITY MECHANIC: The position of the Pink Shield dictates the 'down' direction for the internal Grey Block. (Shield Left -> Block falls Left).\n- SLIDING PHYSICS: The block moves multiple steps (sliding) in a single turn if the path is clear, rather than 1 tile per turn.\n- DIRECT MAPPING: Controls are absolute directions (Left = Left Wall/Gravity), not rotational relative to current position.\n- CORRECTION: The dynamic payload is the ORANGE Block (Color 4), not a Grey Block (Color 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'hidden' grey block was likely incorrect; the visible visual evidence shows the Orange block in the exact position described as 'blocked'.\n- Physics Confirmation: The payload did not move UP because it is physically trapped/blocked by the green terrain immediately above it (an overhang).\n- Goal Identification: The Black U-shape is confirmed as the destination.\n- Confirmed Collision Physics: The payload (Orange Block) stopped moving when it hit a Green internal obstacle, proving that internal terrain is solid and blocks the sliding movement.\n- Confirmed Gravity Direction: Action 4 sets gravity to RIGHT (Pink shield on right), causing rightward movement.\n- Visual Confirmation of Payload: The moving object is definitively the Orange (Color 4) block, despite automated logs referencing Color 8.\n- Confirmed ACTION3 = LEFT Gravity.\n- Visual Evidence Correction: The moving payload is definitely Color 4 (Orange), contradicting the text log's claim of Color 8.\n- Confirmed Collision Logic: The payload stops sliding exactly when it abuts a Green obstacle, confirming they are solid walls.\n- Confirmed Physics: Gravity is applied immediately upon switching the Shield position, causing the payload to slide until blocked.\n- STAGE 2 START: New layout loaded.\n- INITIAL STATE: Gravity corresponds to the Pink Shield position (LEFT).\n- GOAL ORIENTATION: Goal is 'C' shaped, open to the right. This implies the winning move must be a LEFT gravity slide (Action 3) when the payload is aligned.\n- PAYLOAD STATE: Payload starts 'resting' against an obstacle, confirming physics simulation settles before player input.\n- Variable Payload Color: Confirmed that the payload object changes color between stages (Stage 1 was Orange/Color 4, Stage 2 is Grey/Color 11).\n- Goal Geometry Significance: The 'C' shape of the goal (opening to the right) dictates that the final approach vector must be LEFT (Action 3).\n- Collision Confirmation: The payload is currently resting against the left face of the central obstacle, confirming that rightward gravity (Action 4) pushed it until it hit the solid green terrain.\n- Confirmed Level Design Logic: Obstacles are placed specifically to act as 'alignment stops'. The green block the payload landed on is perfectly positioned to align the payload's Y-coordinate with the Goal's Y-coordinate.\n- Confirmed 'Falling' Physics: Changing gravity to Down caused the payload to fall through empty space (Color 9) until collision, validating the 'slide until stop' mechanic in vertical directions as well.\n- Confirmed Stage 2 Payload: The active object is definitely the Grey Block (Color 11), distinct from Stage 1's Orange Block.\n- Goal Approach Vector: The payload is now vertically aligned with the goal. The goal opens to the Right, which implies the next required gravity vector is LEFT (Action 3) to slide the payload into the cup.\n- CONFIRMED WRAP MECHANIC: The 'Active Shield' (Pink) functions as a portal. Objects do not stop at the shield; they pass through and wrap to the opposite side of the screen.\n- TOROIDAL TOPOLOGY: The playfield effectively becomes a cylinder in the direction of the active gravity.\n- NON-EUCLIDEAN MOVEMENT: 'Gravity Up' can result in the object appearing lower on the screen due to wrapping from Top to Bottom.\n- GRAVITY CONFIRMATION: Gravity pulls towards the Pink Shield. (Shield Top = Gravity Up).\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- Does wrapping apply to all 4 directions if the shield is moved there?\n- Does the payload need to stop INSIDE the goal, or just pass through?\n- What is the precise trigger for the win state? (Overlap vs Full Containment)\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"Gravity UP / Wrap Gate: Moves Shield to Top. Sets gravity UP. ALLOWS WRAPPING: Objects slide UP, pass through the top edge, reappear at the bottom, and continue sliding up until blocked.\"\n  ACTION2: \"Gravity DOWN: Move Shield to Bottom. Applies downward force to internal objects.\"\n  ACTION3: \"Gravity LEFT: Move Shield to Left Perimeter. Applies leftward force to internal payload.\"\n  ACTION4: \"Gravity RIGHT: Move Shield to Right. Applies rightward force to internal objects.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n7. UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS: Which colors or sections of the grid have NOT been thoroughly analyzed yet? List specific colors or regions that need more investigation.\n8. DOMAIN DESCRIPTION: Provide a high-level conceptual description of the game. What type of game is this (puzzle, navigation, sokoban-like, etc.)? What appears to be the goal? How do the mechanics work together at a conceptual level?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
