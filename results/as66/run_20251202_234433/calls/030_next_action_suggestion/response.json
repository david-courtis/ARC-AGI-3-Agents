  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has only 2/8 attempts and 0/3 consistent observations. It's a high priority action for further validation. The player block (Color 11) is currently at (48, 40) and there are no immediate green obstacles below it, making it a good state to test downward movement without a setup sequence.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We want to confirm the behavior of ACTION2, specifically regarding player movement (confirming 4-unit downward movement of Color 11 block) and its impact on UI elements and 'grey interactive objects' (Color 4 and Color 11). We'll also observe if the player block changes color upon successful downward movement in this context, correcting any previous misunderstandings about player color states.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 11) is at (48, 40). There's no immediate obstacle below it, making it suitable for testing downward movement. The board contains green 'landmass' obstacles and various dynamic UI elements. The current position is good for directly testing ACTION2."
