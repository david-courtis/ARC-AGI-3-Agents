Regardless of player movement success, it triggers significant UI changes, specifically causing the 'Color 14' UI element to shift its position and orientation (e.g., from a vertical bar on the right to a horizontal bar at the top or forming a top border).\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units down, without changing its color. This action also causes complex UI changes, including the disappearance of certain UI elements and the appearance of new 'grey' (Color 4) interactive objects, and the color change of existing Color 4 objects to Color 11.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the presumed player object (Color 8 rectangular block) one unit to the left in each animation frame until it moves a total of 4 units, or until it hits an obstacle/border. This action also triggers changes in the UI elements: specific Color 14 UI elements disappear and new ones appear.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units to the right. Also causes the Color 14 UI element to reposition.\n  ACTION5: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be a 'no-op' when the player block is in certain states or positions, or when there are no interactable objects in its vicinity.

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red-brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple (Aqua, Blue, Green, Pink, Yellow))\n  Description: A complex border system. An outer aqua (Color 10) single-pixel line forms the perimeter, enclosing blue (Color 9) borders on the top and left sides and green (Color 3) borders on the bottom and right sides. A yellow (Color 12) border is at the very bottom, outside the aqua border. There is now also a pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the very top, at (0,0), and another 48x4 pink (Color 14) block at (4,8) which functions as a top border.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A square play area enclosed by multiple borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks and dynamic UI elements separate from the main play area. There is a perceptible grid-like movement for the player, likely in 4-unit increments.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.\n  - Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.\n  - Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.\n  - Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).\n  - Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.\n  - The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.\n  - Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.\n  - Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.\n  - ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.\n  - Player block (Color 8) can move downwards by 4 units without changing color. This contradicts earlier hypotheses about mandatory color changes upon movement, suggesting color changes are not universal for all player movements. This also establishes a 4-unit movement increment for at least the 'down' action.\n  - New 'grey' (Color 4) objects appear upon successful player movement (ACTION2). This suggests these are either collectibles or triggerable elements, adding complexity to the game goal beyond simple movement.\n  - A previously observed Color 4 object (at 28,36) changed to Color 11 (light grey) upon ACTION2, indicating an interaction or state change for this object type. This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.\n  - Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element. This reinforces that the UI is highly dynamic and likely represents overall game state, rather than just movement counters. The Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7,0) also disappeared.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION1 had an effect on the environment, specifically the UI. Previously it was understood to have no effect on the play area, but now we see a significant UI change, and a new Color 11 object appearing in the play area.\n  - The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28)' (previously Color 4) disappeared, and a new 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' appeared. This confirms that Color 4 objects transform into Color 11 objects upon interaction, and that these Color 11 objects can then be further interacted with or disappear.\n  - The Color 14 UI element continues its highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical (4x48) block at (8,56) to a horizontal (48x4) block at (4,8). This strengthens the hypothesis that it's a critical, multi-state UI indicator, possibly related to turns or available actions.\n  - A new pink (Color 14) block has formed a new top border, indicating borders are dynamic and can be reconfigured or extended based on game state or actions.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions (specifically ACTION5 in this observation) are strong evidence for movement constraints, indicating the player block was blocked in the attempted direction(s) of the action.\n  - Further reinforced the understanding that ACTION5 (and by extension, any 'no effect' action in the future) is evidence of surrounding boundaries or obstacles.\n  - Player Color Confirmed to be Color 11: The player block is now unequivocally identified as Color 11 based on direct observation of its movement. This corrects previous hypotheses about its color (Color 8, Color 14, Color 12). Its color changes state, and currently it is Color 11. Previous descriptions identified 'Color 11' as an 'interactive object (state 2)', implying the player block has adopted this 'state' by changing its color to 11.\n  - ACTION1 functionality clarified: ACTION1 successfully moved the player block (now Color 11) upwards by 4 units. This refutes the previous understanding that ACTION1 'had no effect on the play area' and only triggered UI changes. ACTION1 can indeed move the player. The previous observation of 'no effect' on the play area must have been due to an obstruction, not a fundamental property of ACTION1.\n  - Borders are actively reconfigured: The Color 14 UI element has fully transformed into a top border (48x4 block at (4,8)) and the single-pixel pink line at (0,0), replacing its previous 'vertical bar on the right' form. This reinforces that borders are not just static boundaries but dynamically generated UI that can change orientation and placement.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.\n  - The black 'player' block changes color (color 14 to 12) upon moving, implying a state change associated with movement.\n  - The multi-colored borders (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow) likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - The assumed 'player' block changes color (from Color 14 to Color 12, or just Color 8 here) upon successful movement, implying a state change associated with movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)\n  - The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. (This specific instance of no effect happened before the observed object-level changes).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. However, ACTION1 did trigger UI changes.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm if other moves are also 4 units or if some are 1 unit).\n  - The player block (Color 8) maintains its current color (Color 8) upon successful movement downwards, indicating previous hypotheses about color changes with movement were either specific to other directions/actions, or were incorrect.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2, ACTION3 and ACTION4.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic). ACTION5 attempts to move the Color 8 player block at (24,12), which is surrounded by Color 6 (red-brown) and Color 3 (green) to its left. Its lack of effect implies blockage in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), considering its specific position (24,12) with green obstacles nearby and the blue border to the left.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 11) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments.\n  - ACTION1 (and previous no effect actions) had no effect on the play area when the primary target was blocked, implying the target object was constrained by boundaries or obstacles. However, ACTION1 can still trigger UI changes regardless of play area object movement.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) irregularly shaped blocks\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area)\n      Evidence: It occupies the majority of the screen and objects move within it.\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 11 (light grey) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)\n      Evidence: It moved 4 units upwards in this action, consistent with player control. It was previously Color 8 and Color 14 and Color 12, so it seems to change state/color.\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Obstacles or static environment features)\n      Evidence: Player movement is blocked by these, and they do not appear to move or change.\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Collectible or a target)\n      Evidence: It appears as a distinct object in the play area, suggesting it has a purpose for interaction.\n  - Light grey interactive object (State 2): Color 11 (light grey) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, a 'triggered' or 'collected' state of a separate object type (e.g., Color 4) or an activated power-up.)\n      Evidence: Previous observations show Color 4 objects changing to Color 11 upon interaction. The player block also has this color currently, suggesting it has adopted this 'state'.\n  - Top UI element: Color 14 (light pink) Horizontal rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, possibly a turn counter or available action indicator.)\n      Evidence: It appeared at (4,8) and changes orientation/position frequently in response to actions, even when player movement fails. Its position at the top suggests a 'top' or 'global' state indicator.\n  - Magenta UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Irregular shape (2x2 square) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, potentially a 'turn' or 'energy' indicator.)\n      Evidence: It appears and disappears with actions, separate from the play area.\n  - Grey interactive object (State 1): Color 4 (gray) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, potentially a switch or trigger that changes to Color 11.)\n      Evidence: Has been observed to appear and also transform into Color 11 objects upon interaction.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow, and now pink)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n  - What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed (previously observed), suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).\n  - Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n  - What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 11)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n  - What is the role of the orange block (Color 2)?\n  - How many distinct states/colors can the player block have, and what triggers transitions between them?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (new): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 13 irregular shape (64x7) at (0, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8) at (40, 28): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8) at (44, 44): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Object at (28, 36): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 is confirmed to be a 'no-op' when the player (Color 11 block) is not interacting with anything, demonstrating its behavior when no valid 'interaction' or 'selection' target is present.\n  - The player block is still identified as 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4)' after previous observation.\n  - The 'Color 8 rectangular block (4x4)' is still present at (36, 12) but is not acting as the player block in this instance.\n  - The player block, now consistently identified as 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4)', moves 4 units upwards with ACTION1, confirming the 4-unit increment for vertical movement. This reinforces ACTION1 as 'Move UP'.\n  - The 'Color 14' UI element consistently changes its form and placement with ACTION1, reinforcing its role as a dynamic state indicator rather than a simple counter. It changed from a vertical bar on the right side to a horizontal bar at the top.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION5: 2 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
