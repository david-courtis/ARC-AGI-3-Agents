  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 attempts to move an object (likely the player), and regardless of success in movement, it triggers a change in the Color 14 UI element, indicating a transition in game state or turn.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 attempts to move a specific object (likely the player block) down. If successful, the player block moves down and changes its color (e.g., from 14 to 12). Simultaneously, UI elements appear/change in the top area (Color 13 rectangular block at (0, 25) and Color 14 rectangular block at (56, 8)). The appearance of these UI elements acts as a reliable indicator of a successful action that affects game state.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the presumed player object (Color 8 rectangular block) one unit to the left in each animation frame until it moves a total of 4 units, or until it hits an obstacle/border. This action also triggers changes in the UI elements: specific Color 14 UI elements disappear and new ones appear.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units to the right. Also causes the Color 14 UI element to reposition.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red-brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple)\n  Description: A complex border system. An outer aqua (Color 10) single-pixel line forms the perimeter, enclosing blue (Color 9) borders on the top and left, and green (Color 3) borders on the bottom and right. A yellow (Color 12) border is at the very bottom, outside the aqua border. The UI elements at the top are bordered by magenta (Color 13).\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A square play area enclosed by multiple borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks and a movable player block. There is a distinct UI area at the top and sides of the main play area, indicated by colored blocks.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.\n  - Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.\n  - Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.\n  - Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).\n  - Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.\n  - The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.\n  - Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.\n  - Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.\n  - ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.\n  - The black 'player' block changes color (color 14 to 12) upon moving, implying a state change associated with movement.\n  - The multi-colored borders (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow) likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - The assumed 'player' block changes color (from Color 14 to Color 12, or just Color 8 here) upon successful movement, implying a state change associated with movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)\n  - The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. (This specific instance of no effect happened before the observed object-level changes).\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) irregularly shaped blocks\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area)\n      Evidence: It forms the largest continuous background surface where other objects interact.\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 8 (black) U-shaped block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)\n      Evidence: It is the object that has been observed to move and is targeted by actions. Its color can change upon successful movement.\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Obstacles or static environment features)\n      Evidence: Movement has been observed to be blocked by these. They appear static.\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible or a target)\n      Evidence: It persists across multiple frames without changing shape or position, suggesting it's a static game element like a goal or item to collect, rather than a dynamic obstacle.\n  - Top UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Small rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: UI element, possibly a move counter or status indicator)\n      Evidence: It reliably appears/changes with successful actions and is located outside the main play area. It did not change when ACTION1 had no effect.\n  - Top UI element: Color 14 (light pink) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: UI element, possibly a move counter or status indicator)\n      Evidence: It reliably appears/changes with successful actions and is located outside the main play area. It appeared in the top UI area after ACTION1 had no effect. Its position changed from a vertical bar to a horizontal bar.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n  - What is the precise pattern of color changes for the 'Player/Movable Block' (Color 8, previously Color 14, then Color 12 and 8 in earlier descriptions)? Is it a sequence, or are there different player types/states with distinct colors? Can it be multiple colors at once, or does it change state based on interaction?\n  - What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed, suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).\n  - Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n  - What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION1 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction for the supposed target object. And what specific movement directions does ACTION5 attempt?\n  - What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n  - What is the significance of the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) appearing at (4,8) after ACTION1, and the Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8,4) disappearing? Does this indicate a 'turn' change or a 'power-up' state?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (new): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION5 does not cause visible changes when the player block is in its current position at (28, 40).\n  - The hypothesis that ACTION5 means 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position' is not supported by this observation, as no visible interaction, selection, or rotation occurred.\n  - Confirmed that green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) act as solid obstacles, preventing the player block from moving through them.\n  - The UI elements (Color 14 blocks) change even when the player's action (moving) has no effect. This suggests the UI elements track that an action was *attempted* or *taken*, not just that it was successful.\n  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the 'Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8)' and disappearance of the 'Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)' indicates a complex UI state where the UI element shifts its position and orientation, potentially from a vertical bar on the left to a horizontal bar at the top.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",
