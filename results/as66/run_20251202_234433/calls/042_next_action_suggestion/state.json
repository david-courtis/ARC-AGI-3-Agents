      "Confirmed that green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) act as solid obstacles, preventing the player block from moving through them.",
      "The UI elements (Color 14 blocks) change even when the player's action (moving) has no effect. This suggests the UI elements track that an action was *attempted* or *taken*, not just that it was successful.",
      "Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the 'Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8)' and disappearance of the 'Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)' indicates a complex UI state where the UI element shifts its position and orientation, potentially from a vertical bar on the left to a horizontal bar at the top.",
      "The player block (Color 8) does not change color upon successful movement, contradicting a previous hypothesis. It remains Color 8.",
      "The UI element changes are more complex than previously understood, involving multiple Color 13, Color 14, and Color 12 blocks disappearing and appearing, and other Color 4 objects in the play area possibly changing or moving. This suggests a broader 'turn' or 'game state' update rather than just simple move counters for the player block.",

      "Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.",
      "Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.",
      "Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).",
      "Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.",
      "The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.",
      "Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.",
      "Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.",
      "Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.",
      "ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.",
      "Player block (Color 8) can move downwards by 4 units without changing color. This contradicts earlier hypotheses about mandatory color changes upon movement, suggesting color changes are not universal for all player movements. This also establishes a 4-unit movement increment for at least the 'down' action.",
      "New 'grey' (Color 4) objects appear upon successful player movement (ACTION2). This suggests these are either collectibles or triggerable elements, adding complexity to the game goal beyond simple movement.",
      "A previously observed Color 4 object (at 28,36) changed to Color 11 (light grey) upon ACTION2, indicating an interaction or state change for this object type. This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.",
      "Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element. This reinforces that the UI is highly dynamic and likely represents overall game state, rather than just movement counters. The Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7,0) also disappeared.",
      "Confirmed that ACTION1 had an effect on the environment, specifically the UI. Previously it was understood to have no effect on the play area, but now we see a significant UI change, and a new Color 11 object appearing in the play area.",
      "The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28)' (previously Color 4) disappeared, and a new 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' appeared. This confirms that Color 4 objects transform into Color 11 objects upon interaction, and that these Color 11 objects can then be further interacted with or disappear.",
      "The Color 14 UI element continues its highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical (4x48) block at (8,56) to a horizontal (48x4) block at (4,8). This strengthens the hypothesis that it's a critical, multi-state UI indicator, possibly related to turns or available actions.",
      "A new pink (Color 14) block has formed a new top border, indicating borders are dynamic and can be reconfigured or extended based on game state or actions.",
      "Confirmed that 'no effect' actions (specifically ACTION5 in this observation) are strong evidence for movement constraints, indicating the player block was blocked in the attempted direction(s) of the action.",
      "Further reinforced the understanding that ACTION5 (and by extension, any 'no effect' action in the future) is evidence of surrounding boundaries or obstacles.",
      "Player Color Confirmed to be Color 11: The player block is now unequivocally identified as Color 11 based on direct observation of its movement. This corrects previous hypotheses about its color (Color 8, Color 14, Color 12). Its color changes state, and currently it is Color 11. Previous descriptions identified 'Color 11' as an 'interactive object (state 2)', implying the player block has adopted this 'state' by changing its color to 11.",
      "ACTION1 functionality clarified: ACTION1 successfully moved the player block (now Color 11) upwards by 4 units. This refutes the previous understanding that ACTION1 'had no effect on the play area' and only triggered UI changes. ACTION1 can indeed move the player. The previous observation of 'no effect' on the play area must have been due to an obstruction, not a fundamental property of ACTION1.",
      "Borders are actively reconfigured: The Color 14 UI element has fully transformed into a top border (48x4 block at (4,8)) and the single-pixel pink line at (0,0), replacing its previous 'vertical bar on the right' form. This reinforces that borders are not just static boundaries but dynamically generated UI that can change orientation and placement.",
      "Confirmed that the primary Color 14 UI element is highly dynamic, not only changing orientation but also relocating entirely, in this case from a top border (48x4 at (4,8)) to a right border (48x4 at (56,8)). This reinforces its role as a complex state indicator.",
      "The player block (Color 11) successfully moved 4 units upwards, confirming that ACTION2 moves the player block upwards, despite previous semantic hints. It also confirms the player block maintained its Color 11 state after moving.",
      "Correction in previous breakthrough: The 'Top UI element' that was a 48x4 pink block at (4,8) is now identified as a 'Right UI element' which is also a 48x4 pink block but at (56,8). This shows a transformation and relocation, not just a border extension.",
      "Confirmed that ACTION3 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left. This clarifies its primary function and confirms consistent 4-unit movement for at least three actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3).",
      "Further observed the dynamic nature of the Color 14 UI element: it transformed from a 'Right UI element' (48x4 block at (56,8)) to a 'Left UI element' (4x48 block at (8,4)), reinforcing its role as a complex, multi-state indicator that reconfigures itself across the screen.",
      "ACTION4 functionality clarified: ACTION4 successfully moved the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left, which corrects the previous understanding of ACTION4 as moving right. This clarifies its primary function when unobstructed.",
      "Player color confirmed to be Color 11: The player block, which moved, is definitively Color 11. This refines its role as 'Player/Movable Block' and confirms it can have at least two observed color states (Color 8 and Color 11), suggesting a state-management mechanic via color changes.",
      "New UI element formation: A Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4,8) appeared, becoming a 'Top UI element' which is distinct from the single pixel pink line at (0,0). This reinforces the concept of dynamic and multi-component UI elements for Color 14."
