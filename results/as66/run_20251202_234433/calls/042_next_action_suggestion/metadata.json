  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves the player block (currently identified as Color 11) 4 units upwards, provided there is no obstruction. Regardless of player movement success, it triggers significant UI changes, specifically causing the 'Color 14' UI element to shift its position and orientation (e.g., from a vertical bar on the right to a horizontal bar at the top or forming a top border). The appearance of a second 'Color 11' block at (48,X) is likely a UI related event or an artifact of object detection.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units upwards. This action also causes complex UI changes, including the disappearance of a horizontal Color 14 UI element from the top and the appearance of a vertical Color 14 UI element on the right.\n  ACTION3: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left, provided there is no obstruction. It also triggers corresponding UI changes, specifically causing the 'Color 14' UI element to shift its position and orientation, such as from a right-side vertical bar to a left-side vertical bar.\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left, provided there is no obstruction. It also causes the Color 14 UI element to reposition from the left side to the right side of the screen.\n  ACTION5: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be a 'no-op' when the player block is in certain states or positions, or when there are no interactable objects in its vicinity. It does not trigger any visible movement or object transformation.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red-brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple)\n  Description: A complex border system. An outer aqua (Color 10) single-pixel line forms the perimeter, enclosing blue (Color 9) borders on the top and left sides and green (Color 3) borders on the bottom and right sides. A yellow (Color 12) border is at the very bottom, outside the aqua border. There is now a pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the very top, at (0,0).\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A square play area enclosed by multiple dynamically reconfiguring borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks. There is a perceptible grid-like movement for the player, likely in 4-unit increments. UI elements are outside the main play area and highly dynamic.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.\n  - Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.\n  - Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.\n  - Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).\n  - Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.\n  - The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.\n  - Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.\n  - Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.\n  - ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.\n  - Player block (Color 8) can move downwards by 4 units without changing color. This contradicts earlier hypotheses about mandatory color changes upon movement, suggesting color changes are not universal for all player movements. This also establishes a 4-unit movement increment for at least the 'down' action.\n  - New 'grey' (Color 4) objects appear upon successful player movement (ACTION2). This suggests these are either collectibles or triggerable elements, adding complexity to the game goal beyond simple movement.\n  - A previously observed Color 4 object (at 28,36) changed to Color 11 (light grey) upon ACTION2, indicating an interaction or state change for this object type. This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.\n  - Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element. This reinforces that the UI is highly dynamic and likely represents overall game state, rather than just movement counters. The Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7,0) also disappeared.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION1 had an effect on the environment, specifically the UI. Previously it was understood to have no effect on the play area, but now we see a significant UI change, and a new Color 11 object appearing in the play area.\n  - The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28)' (previously Color 4) disappeared, and a new 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' appeared. This confirms that Color 4 objects transform into Color 11 objects upon interaction, and that these Color 11 objects can then be further interacted with or disappear.\n  - The Color 14 UI element continues its highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical (4x48) block at (8,56) to a horizontal (48x4) block at (4,8). This strengthens the hypothesis that it's a critical, multi-state UI indicator, possibly related to turns or available actions.\n  - A new pink (Color 14) block has formed a new top border, indicating borders are dynamic and can be reconfigured or extended based on game state or actions.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions (specifically ACTION5 in this observation) are strong evidence for movement constraints, indicating the player block was blocked in the attempted direction(s) of the action.\n  - Further reinforced the understanding that ACTION5 (and by extension, any 'no effect' action in the future) is evidence of surrounding boundaries or obstacles.\n  - Player Color Confirmed to be Color 11: The player block is now unequivocally identified as Color 11 based on direct observation of its movement. This corrects previous hypotheses about its color (Color 8, Color 14, Color 12). Its color changes state, and currently it is Color 11. Previous descriptions identified 'Color 11' as an 'interactive object (state 2)', implying the player block has adopted this 'state' by changing its color to 11.\n  - ACTION1 functionality clarified: ACTION1 successfully moved the player block (now Color 11) upwards by 4 units. This refutes the previous understanding that ACTION1 'had no effect on the play area' and only triggered UI changes. ACTION1 can indeed move the player. The previous observation of 'no effect' on the play area must have been due to an obstruction, not a fundamental property of ACTION1.\n  - Borders are actively reconfigured: The Color 14 UI element has fully transformed into a top border (48x4 block at (4,8)) and the single-pixel pink line at (0,0), replacing its previous 'vertical bar on the right' form. This reinforces that borders are not just static boundaries but dynamically generated UI that can change orientation and placement.\n  - Confirmed that the primary Color 14 UI element is highly dynamic, not only changing orientation but also relocating entirely, in this case from a top border (48x4 at (4,8)) to a right border (48x4 at (56,8)). This reinforces its role as a complex state indicator.\n  - The player block (Color 11) successfully moved 4 units upwards, confirming that ACTION2 moves the player block upwards, despite previous semantic hints. It also confirms the player block maintained its Color 11 state after moving.\n  - Correction in previous breakthrough: The 'Top UI element' that was a 48x4 pink block at (4,8) is now identified as a 'Right UI element' which is also a 48x4 pink block but at (56,8). This shows a transformation and relocation, not just a border extension.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION3 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left. This clarifies its primary function and confirms consistent 4-unit movement for at least three actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3).\n  - Further observed the dynamic nature of the Color 14 UI element: it transformed from a 'Right UI element' (48x4 block at (56,8)) to a 'Left UI element' (4x48 block at (8,4)), reinforcing its role as a complex, multi-state indicator that reconfigures itself across the screen.\n  - ACTION4 functionality clarified: ACTION4 successfully moved the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left, which corrects the previous understanding of ACTION4 as moving right. This clarifies its primary function when unobstructed.\n  - Player color confirmed to be Color 11: The player block, which moved, is definitively Color 11. This refines its role as 'Player/Movable Block' and confirms it can have at least two observed color states (Color 8 and Color 11), suggesting a state-management mechanic via color changes.\n  - New UI element formation: A Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4,8) appeared, becoming a 'Top UI element' which is distinct from the single pixel pink line at (0,0). This reinforces the concept of dynamic and multi-component UI elements for Color 14.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.\n  - The black 'player' block changes color (color 14 to 12) upon moving, implying a state change associated with movement.\n  - The multi-colored borders (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow) likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - The assumed 'player' block changes color (from Color 14 to Color 12, or just Color 8 here) upon successful movement, implying a state change associated with movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)\n  - The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. (This specific instance of no effect happened before the observed object-level changes).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. However, ACTION1 did trigger UI changes.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm if other moves are also 4 units or if some are 1 unit).\n  - The player block (Color 8) maintains its current color (Color 8) upon successful movement downwards, indicating previous hypotheses about color changes with movement were either specific to other directions/actions, or were incorrect.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2, ACTION3 and ACTION4.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic). ACTION5 attempts to move the Color 8 player block at (24,12), which is surrounded by Color 6 (red-brown) and Color 3 (green) to its left. Its lack of effect implies blockage in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), considering its specific position (24,12) with green obstacles nearby and the blue border to the left.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 11) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments.\n  - ACTION1 (and previous no effect actions) had no effect on the play area when the primary target was blocked, implying the target object was constrained by boundaries or obstacles. However, ACTION1 can still trigger UI changes regardless of play area object movement.\n  - ACTION5 and ACTION1 (when the player block is obstructed) indicate that the player block is blocked by either game boundaries or internal obstacles when an action has no effect on its position in the play area.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8 or Color 11) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - ACTION5 and other 'no effect' actions are strong evidence that the player block is blocked by either boundaries or internal obstacles when an attempted move does not result in a position change.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments in all observed successful moves (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4).\n  - ACTION5 and other 'no effect' actions reveal that the player block is blocked by either boundaries or internal obstacles when an attempted move does not result in a position change.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) irregularly shaped blocks\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area)\n      Evidence: It occupies the majority of the screen and other objects move within it.\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 11 (light grey) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)\n      Evidence: It moved 4 units up via ACTION1, confirming its player/movable role. Its color was previously Color 8 and Color 14 and Color 12, suggesting color changes are state-dependent.\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Obstacles or static environment features)\n      Evidence: They consistently block player movement and remain static.\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Collectible or a target)\n      Evidence: Its small size and distinct color suggest it might be something to collect or interact with.\n  - Grey interactive object (State 1): Color 4 (gray) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, potentially a switch or trigger that changes to Color 11 upon interaction.)\n      Evidence: Previous observations confirm these change to Color 11 upon interaction.\n  - Top UI element (pink line): Color 14 (light pink) Horizontal line (1x64) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, possibly a turn counter or available action indicator.)\n      Evidence: It is at the very top, outside the play area, and changes dynamically with actions.\n  - Magenta UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Irregular shape (2x2 square) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, potentially a 'turn' or 'energy' indicator.)\n      Evidence: It is located outside the main play area and changes with actions.\n  - Top UI element (horizontal bar): Color 14 (light pink) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, possibly a turn counter or available action indicator.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (4,8) replacing a previous border element. It's outside the main play area and highly dynamic, changing position and orientation in response to actions.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow, and now pink)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n  - What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed (previously observed), suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).\n  - Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n  - What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 11)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n  - What is the role of the orange block (Color 2)?\n  - How many distinct states/colors can the player block have, and what triggers transitions between them?\n  - What is the ultimate goal of the game, given the dynamic UI elements, interactive objects, and player movement?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (new): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 13 irregular shape (64x7) at (0, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8) at (40, 28): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8) at (44, 44): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Object at (28, 36): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (32, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (20, 40) (player block): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (Right UI element): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4) (Left UI element): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (20, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (20, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The primary Color 14 UI element continues to demonstrate highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a horizontal right border to a vertical left border. This solidifies its role as a complex, multi-state UI indicator, possibly signifying turn or available action.\n  - The player block is confirmed to be Color 11, moving right by 4 units with ACTION4. This is consistent with previous observations of player movement in 4-unit increments.\n  - The primary Color 14 UI element continues to demonstrate highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical left border to a vertical right border, similar to previous observations of it moving between top/bottom or left/right. This solidifies its role as a complex, multi-state UI indicator, possibly signifying turn or available action.\n  - The player block is confirmed to be Color 11 and moves by 4 units upwards with ACTION1.\n  - The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 32)' appearing in the object detection is likely a persistent UI element or an artifact of object detection rather than a new interactive object, as it frequently appears / moves around after an action, but doesn't seem to have independent properties as a secondary player object.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

Regardless of player movement success, it triggers significant UI changes, specifically causing the 'Color 14' UI element to shift its position and orientation (e.g., from a vertical bar on the right to a horizontal bar at the top or forming a top border).

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red-brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple)\n  Description: A complex border system. An outer aqua (Color 10) single-pixel line forms the perimeter, enclosing blue (Color 9) borders on the top and left sides and green (Color 3) borders on the bottom and right sides. A yellow (Color 12) border is at the very bottom, outside the aqua border. There is now a pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the very top, at (0,0).\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A square play area enclosed by multiple dynamically reconfiguring borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks. There is a perceptible grid-like movement for the player, likely in 4-unit increments. UI elements are outside the main play area and highly dynamic.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.\n  - Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.\n  - Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.\n  - Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).\n  - Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.\n  - The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.\n  - Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.\n  - Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.\n  - ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.\n  - Player block (Color 8) can move downwards by 4 units without changing color. This contradicts earlier hypotheses about mandatory color changes upon movement, suggesting color changes are not universal for all player movements. This also establishes a 4-unit movement increment for at least the 'down' action.\n  - New 'grey' (Color 4) objects appear upon successful player movement (ACTION2). This suggests these are either collectibles or triggerable elements, adding complexity to the game goal beyond simple movement.\n  - A previously observed Color 4 object (at 28,36) changed to Color 11 (light grey) upon ACTION2, indicating an interaction or state change for this object type. This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.\n  - Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element. This reinforces that the UI is highly dynamic and likely represents overall game state, rather than just movement counters. The Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7,0) also disappeared.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION1 had an effect on the environment, specifically the UI. Previously it was understood to have no effect on the play area, but now we see a significant UI change, and a new Color 11 object appearing in the play area.\n  - The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28)' (previously Color 4) disappeared, and a new 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' appeared. This confirms that Color 4 objects transform into Color 11 objects upon interaction, and that these Color 11 objects can then be further interacted with or disappear.\n  - The Color 14 UI element continues its highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical (4x48) block at (8,56) to a horizontal (48x4) block at (4,8). This strengthens the hypothesis that it's a critical, multi-state UI indicator, possibly related to turns or available actions.\n  - A new pink (Color 14) block has formed a new top border, indicating borders are dynamic and can be reconfigured or extended based on game state or actions.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions (specifically ACTION5 in this observation) are strong evidence for movement constraints, indicating the player block was blocked in the attempted direction(s) of the action.\n  - Further reinforced the understanding that ACTION5 (and by extension, any 'no effect' action in the future) is evidence of surrounding boundaries or obstacles.\n  - Player Color Confirmed to be Color 11: The player block is now unequivocally identified as Color 11 based on direct observation of its movement. This corrects previous hypotheses about its color (Color 8, Color 14, Color 12). Its color changes state, and currently it is Color 11. Previous descriptions identified 'Color 11' as an 'interactive object (state 2)', implying the player block has adopted this 'state' by changing its color to 11.\n  - ACTION1 functionality clarified: ACTION1 successfully moved the player block (now Color 11) upwards by 4 units. This refutes the previous understanding that ACTION1 'had no effect on the play area' and only triggered UI changes. ACTION1 can indeed move the player. The previous observation of 'no effect' on the play area must have been due to an obstruction, not a fundamental property of ACTION1.\n  - Borders are actively reconfigured: The Color 14 UI element has fully transformed into a top border (48x4 block at (4,8)) and the single-pixel pink line at (0,0), replacing its previous 'vertical bar on the right' form. This reinforces that borders are not just static boundaries but dynamically generated UI that can change orientation and placement.\n  - Confirmed that the primary Color 14 UI element is highly dynamic, not only changing orientation but also relocating entirely, in this case from a top border (48x4 at (4,8)) to a right border (48x4 at (56,8)). This reinforces its role as a complex state indicator.\n  - The player block (Color 11) successfully moved 4 units upwards, confirming that ACTION2 moves the player block upwards, despite previous semantic hints. It also confirms the player block maintained its Color 11 state after moving.\n  - Correction in previous breakthrough: The 'Top UI element' that was a 48x4 pink block at (4,8) is now identified as a 'Right UI element' which is also a 48x4 pink block but at (56,8). This shows a transformation and relocation, not just a border extension.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION3 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left. This clarifies its primary function and confirms consistent 4-unit movement for at least three actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3).\n  - Further observed the dynamic nature of the Color 14 UI element: it transformed from a 'Right UI element' (48x4 block at (56,8)) to a 'Left UI element' (4x48 block at (8,4)), reinforcing its role as a complex, multi-state indicator that reconfigures itself across the screen.\n  - ACTION4 functionality clarified: ACTION4 successfully moved the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left, which corrects the previous understanding of ACTION4 as moving right. This clarifies its primary function when unobstructed.\n  - Player color confirmed to be Color 11: The player block, which moved, is definitively Color 11. This refines its role as 'Player/Movable Block' and confirms it can have at least two observed color states (Color 8 and Color 11), suggesting a state-management mechanic via color changes.\n  - New UI element formation: A Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4,8) appeared, becoming a 'Top UI element' which is distinct from the single pixel pink line at (0,0). This reinforces the concept of dynamic and multi-component UI elements for Color 14.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.\n  - The black 'player' block changes color (color 14 to 12) upon moving, implying a state change associated with movement.\n  - The multi-colored borders (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow) likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - The assumed 'player' block changes color (from Color 14 to Color 12, or just Color 8 here) upon successful movement, implying a state change associated with movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)\n  - The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. (This specific instance of no effect happened before the observed object-level changes).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. However, ACTION1 did trigger UI changes.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm if other moves are also 4 units or if some are 1 unit).\n  - The player block (Color 8) maintains its current color (Color 8) upon successful movement downwards, indicating previous hypotheses about color changes with movement were either specific to other directions/actions, or were incorrect.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2, ACTION3 and ACTION4.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic). ACTION5 attempts to move the Color 8 player block at (24,12), which is surrounded by Color 6 (red-brown) and Color 3 (green) to its left. Its lack of effect implies blockage in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), considering its specific position (24,12) with green obstacles nearby and the blue border to the left.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 11) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments.\n  - ACTION1 (and previous no effect actions) had no effect on the play area when the primary target was blocked, implying the target object was constrained by boundaries or obstacles. However, ACTION1 can still trigger UI changes regardless of play area object movement.\n  - ACTION5 and ACTION1 (when the player block is obstructed) indicate that the player block is blocked by either game boundaries or internal obstacles when an action has no effect on its position in the play area.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8 or Color 11) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - ACTION5 and other 'no effect' actions are strong evidence that the player block is blocked by either boundaries or internal obstacles when an attempted move does not result in a position change.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments in all observed successful moves (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4).\n  - ACTION5 and other 'no effect' actions reveal that the player block is blocked by either boundaries or internal obstacles when an attempted move does not result in a position change.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) irregularly shaped blocks\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area)\n      Evidence: It occupies the majority of the screen and other objects move within it.\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 11 (light grey) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)\n      Evidence: It moved 4 units up via ACTION1, confirming its player/movable role. Its color was previously Color 8 and Color 14 and Color 12, suggesting color changes are state-dependent.\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Obstacles or static environment features)\n      Evidence: They consistently block player movement and remain static.\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Collectible or a target)\n      Evidence: Its small size and distinct color suggest it might be something to collect or interact with.\n  - Grey interactive object (State 1): Color 4 (gray) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, potentially a switch or trigger that changes to Color 11 upon interaction.)\n      Evidence: Previous observations confirm these change to Color 11 upon interaction.\n  - Top UI element (pink line): Color 14 (light pink) Horizontal line (1x64) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, possibly a turn counter or available action indicator.)\n      Evidence: It is at the very top, outside the play area, and changes dynamically with actions.\n  - Magenta UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Irregular shape (2x2 square) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, potentially a 'turn' or 'energy' indicator.)\n      Evidence: It is located outside the main play area and changes with actions.\n  - Top UI element (horizontal bar): Color 14 (light pink) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, possibly a turn counter or available action indicator.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (4,8) replacing a previous border element. It's outside the main play area and highly dynamic, changing position and orientation in response to actions.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow, and now pink)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n  - What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed (previously observed), suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).\n  - Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n  - What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 11)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n  - What is the role of the orange block (Color 2)?\n  - How many distinct states/colors can the player block have, and what triggers transitions between them?\n  - What is the ultimate goal of the game, given the dynamic UI elements, interactive objects, and player movement?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (new): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 13 irregular shape (64x7) at (0, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8) at (40, 28): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8) at (44, 44): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Object at (28, 36): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 40): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (32, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (20, 40) (player block): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (Right UI element): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4) (Left UI element): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (20, 40): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (20, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 32): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The primary Color 14 UI element continues to demonstrate highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a horizontal right border to a vertical left border. This solidifies its role as a complex, multi-state UI indicator, possibly signifying turn or available action.\n  - The player block is confirmed to be Color 11, moving right by 4 units with ACTION4. This is consistent with previous observations of player movement in 4-unit increments.\n  - The primary Color 14 UI element continues to demonstrate highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical left border to a vertical right border, similar to previous observations of it moving between top/bottom or left/right. This solidifies its role as a complex, multi-state UI indicator, possibly signifying turn or available action.\n  - The player block is confirmed to be Color 11 and moves by 4 units upwards with ACTION1.\n  - The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 32)' appearing in the object detection is likely a persistent UI element or an artifact of object detection rather than a new interactive object, as it frequently appears / moves around after an action, but doesn't seem to have independent properties as a secondary player object.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION5: 2 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has been consistently showing 'no effect' recently. According to the critical rules, if an action had no effect, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying that action. We need to validate ACTION5 further to confirm its behavior, especially whether it's truly a no-op or if it requires a specific context. The current player block (Color 11) is at (20,32). The objective of the setup sequence is to move the player block to a new position, preferably near an interactive object (Color 4 or Color 2) or where it is not immediately bounded, to give ACTION5 a better chance of having an effect. The current position at (20,32) is relatively clear. Based on the map, moving down and then right will put the player block to a novel position near Color 6 (red-brown) and the right border, which may or may not provide new context. ACTION2 moves down, ACTION4 moves right. A sequence of ACTION2 (down), ACTION2 (down), ACTION2 (down), ACTION4 (right) will move the player from (20,32) to (20,36) then (20,40) then (20,44) then to (24,44). This is a significantly different position from previous 'no effect' attempts with ACTION5 and can help determine if ACTION5 interacts with specific objects or boundaries. We will retry ACTION5 after this movement.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to definitively verify ACTION5. By moving the player to a new position, we want to see if ACTION5 continues to have no effect, which would strengthen the hypothesis that it is a 'no-op' or requires a specific, yet unseen, condition. Alternatively, if it does have an effect, we will learn about its true function and the conditions under which it operates.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 11) is currently at (20,32). It has some clear space around it on the right and below, but is near a green block (Color 3) above and to the left. There's a grey block (Color 4) at (28,36) and another at (44,44), and an orange block (Color 2) at (40,24). The current position is not ideal for testing ACTION5's interaction capabilities directly with the known interactive objects, as they are not immediately adjacent. Hence, a setup sequence is required."
