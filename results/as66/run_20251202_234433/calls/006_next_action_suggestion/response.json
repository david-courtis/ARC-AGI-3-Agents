  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has not been observed yet, making it a high priority for exploration. Since the player block is centrally located and not against an immediate boundary for horizontal movement, the current state is suitable for testing ACTION3 without a setup sequence.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION3. Specifically, whether it moves the player block LEFT, if it changes color upon movement, or if it has any other side effects, including UI changes.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 8 U-shaped) is currently at (16,40). It is surrounded by Color 6 (red-brown) space, with no immediate green 'landmass' obstacles to its left, allowing for a clear test of horizontal movement. The borders are far enough away to not interfere with an initial left movement attempt. The state is good for testing an unobserved horizontal movement action."
