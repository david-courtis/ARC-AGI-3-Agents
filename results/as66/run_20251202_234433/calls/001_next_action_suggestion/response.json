  "reasoning": "All actions are currently unknown and need to be tested. Prioritizing movement actions first to understand navigation. ACTION1 (Move UP) is chosen as the first to test since it's a fundamental movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Observing if ACTION1 causes a character to move upwards or if it has another effect or no effect at all. This will help us understand basic navigation.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows a character (black pixels with a specific shape) within a red area with green splotches, bordered by blue, pink, green, and yellow strips. The character is not against any wall or obstacle that would immediately block upward movement, making it a good state to test ACTION1 (Move UP)."
