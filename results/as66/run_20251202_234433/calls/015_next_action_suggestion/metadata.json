  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 seems to be an action that attempts to modify the game state, likely by moving an active object. In this instance, it had no visible effect. It's possible there is no active object specified, or a constraint prevented movement. This contradicts the semantic hint that ACTION1 means 'Move UP'.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 attempts to move a specific object (likely the player block) down. If successful, the player block moves down and changes its color (e.g., from 14 to 12). Simultaneously, UI elements appear/change in the top area (Color 13 rectangular block at (0, 25) and Color 14 rectangular block at (56, 8)). The appearance of these UI elements acts as a reliable indicator of a successful action that affects game state.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the presumed player object (Color 8 rectangular block) one unit to the left in each animation frame until it moves a total of 4 units, or until it hits an obstacle/border. This action also triggers changes in the UI elements: specific Color 14 UI elements disappear and new ones appear.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units to the right. Also causes the Color 14 UI element to reposition.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red-brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple)\n  Description: A complex border system. An outer aqua (Color 10) single-pixel line forms the perimeter, enclosing blue (Color 9) borders on the top and left, and green (Color 3) borders on the bottom and right. A light pink bar (Color 14) is on the right side, inside the green border. A yellow (Color 12) border is at the very bottom, outside the aqua border. The UI elements at the top are bordered by magenta (Color 13) and light pink (Color 14).\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A square play area enclosed by multiple borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks and a movable player block. There is a distinct UI area at the top and left/right of the main play area, indicated by colored blocks.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.\n  - Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.\n  - Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.\n  - Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).\n  - Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.\n  - The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.\n  - Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.\n  - The black 'player' block changes color (color 14 to 12) upon moving, implying a state change associated with movement.\n  - The multi-colored borders (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow) likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - The assumed 'player' block changes color (from Color 14 to Color 12, or just Color 8 here) upon successful movement, implying a state change associated with movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)\n  - The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) irregularly shaped blocks\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area)\n      Evidence: Other objects are located within this area, and it fills most of the screen.\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 8 (black) U-shaped block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)\n      Evidence: It has been observed to move in response to actions (ACTION3, ACTION4), and its color has been noted to change upon movement. The lack of effect from ACTION5 suggests it was the intended target.\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Obstacles or static environment features)\n      Evidence: The player block cannot move through them. They have not been observed to move or change.\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible or a target)\n      Evidence: Its small size and distinct color suggest it might be something to collect or interact with. Its position has not changed.\n  - Top UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Small rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: UI element, possibly a move counter or status indicator)\n      Evidence: Its position at the top, outside the main play area, and observed changes with successful actions (ACTION2) indicate a UI role. No change for ACTION5 suggests it's not simply a 'move taken' counter.\n  - Left/Right UI element: Color 14 (light pink) Long rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: UI element, possibly a move counter or status bar)\n      Evidence: Its position outside the play area and observed movement/repositioning (from left to right with ACTION4) indicate a dynamic UI role. No change for ACTION5 suggests it's not simply a 'move taken' counter.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact role and function of each of the five distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n  - What is the precise pattern of color changes for the 'Player/Movable Block' (Color 8, previously Color 14, then Color 12 and 8 in earlier descriptions)? Is it a sequence, or are there different player types/states with distinct colors? Can it be multiple colors at once, or does it change state based on interaction?\n  - What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? Are they move counters, scores, turn indicators, or progress bars, and how do their sizes/positions relate to game state? The fact they didn't change with 'no effect' means they track *successful* changes to game state.\n  - Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n  - What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION5 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction. What would cause ACTION5 to have no effect on the current player block (Color 8)?\n  - What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (new): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The UI element that was 'Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8)' disappeared, and a different UI element 'Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)' appeared, indicating that UI elements can be replaced or change significantly with actions.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION4 moves the 'player' object (Color 8 block) to the right.\n  - The UI element for 'Left UI element' (Color 14 rectangular block) seems to move/replace from left to right as an action is performed, changing its position rather than its size.\n  - ACTION5 does not cause visible changes when the player block is in its current position at (28, 40).\n  - The hypothesis that ACTION5 means 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position' is not supported by this observation, as no visible interaction, selection, or rotation occurred.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

According to the rules, we must use a setup sequence to move the player block to a new position before retrying these actions. Since both ACTION2 and ACTION3 are observed to cause movement and affect the UI, they provide a reliable way to change the game state. This setup sequence moves the player down and then left significantly changing its position. By retrying ACTION1 after this movement, we can investigate if its previous 'no effect' was due to a positional constraint or if its function is truly something other than 'Move UP'. We are prioritizing ACTION1 because its semantic hint suggests movement, but observations contradict this, making it a high-priority action to clarify.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We aim to clarify the function of ACTION1. If it causes movement 'UP' from the new position, it will validate the semantic hint and previous observation might be a constraint. If it still has no effect, we will know it's not a simple 'Move UP' from two different positions. We will also observe how the UI elements respond to this new sequence of actions, further refining our understanding of their dynamic behavior.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 8) is currently positioned at (28, 40), and is surrounded by red-brown (Color 6) background, meaning it is not directly adjacent to any green landmass blocks or borders in all directions. However, its previous attempts for ACTION1 and ACTION5 had no effect. A setup sequence of ACTION2 followed by ACTION3 will move the player block significantly, providing a fresh context for testing ACTION1."
