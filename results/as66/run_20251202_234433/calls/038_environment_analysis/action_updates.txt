ACTION4: ACTION4 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left, provided there is no obstruction. It also causes the Color 14 UI element to reposition from the left side to the right side of the screen.
  Reason: Direct observation confirms ACTION4 moved the player block left by 4 units. This corrects the previous hypothesis that ACTION4 moved the player 'right'. The UI change association remains consistent.
