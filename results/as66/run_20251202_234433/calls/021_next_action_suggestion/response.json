  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has had no effect in recent attempts and is 1/3 consistent, meaning we need to test it again to try and verify it. Since it had no effect previously, we must move the player to a new position before re-testing it. ACTION4 (Move RIGHT) is 1/3 consistent and thus needs to be tested more to become verified, but it did have an effect recently. Moving right twice should get us away from the current obstacle/border that prevented ACTION1 from working in its previous position. We are trying to vary positions frequently to discover context-dependent behaviors for ACTION1.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify if ACTION1 moves the player block (Color 8) UP and observe any associated UI changes. Determine the increment of movement for ACTION1. Observe if the player block changes color upon movement with ACTION1, and if so, to what color. Additionally, we will gain more data points for ACTION4, bringing it closer to verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 8) is currently located at (28,32). There is a green 'landmass' block (Color 3) directly above and to the right of the player block, and a pink (Color 14) UI element to its left. The current position is not ideal for testing ACTION1 due to its previous 'no effect' result, suggesting it was blocked. Moving right twice should place the player in a more open space within the play area to allow for upward movement."
