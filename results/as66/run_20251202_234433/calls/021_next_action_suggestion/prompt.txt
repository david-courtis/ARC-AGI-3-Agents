Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 attempts to move an object (likely the player), and regardless of success in movement, it triggers a change in the Color 14 UI element, indicating a transition in game state or turn.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units down, without changing its color. This action also causes complex UI changes, including the disappearance of certain UI elements and the appearance of new 'grey' (Color 4) interactive objects, and the color change of existing Color 4 objects to Color 11.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the presumed player object (Color 8 rectangular block) one unit to the left in each animation frame until it moves a total of 4 units, or until it hits an obstacle/border. This action also triggers changes in the UI elements: specific Color 14 UI elements disappear and new ones appear.
  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units to the right. Also causes the Color 14 UI element to reposition.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 6 (red-brown)

BORDER: Yes (Multiple)
  Description: A complex border system. An outer aqua (Color 10) single-pixel line forms the perimeter, enclosing blue (Color 9) borders on the top and left sides and green (Color 3) borders on the bottom and right sides. A yellow (Color 12) border is at the very bottom, outside the aqua border.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  A square play area enclosed by multiple borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks and dynamic UI elements separate from the main play area. There is a perceptible grid-like movement for the player.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.
  - Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.
  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.
  - Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.
  - Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).
  - Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.
  - The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.
  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.
  - Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.
  - Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.
  - ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.
  - Player block (Color 8) can move downwards by 4 units without changing color. This contradicts earlier hypotheses about mandatory color changes upon movement, suggesting color changes are not universal for all player movements. This also establishes a 4-unit movement increment for at least the 'down' action.
  - New 'grey' (Color 4) objects appear upon successful player movement (ACTION2). This suggests these are either collectibles or triggerable elements, adding complexity to the game goal beyond simple movement.
  - A previously observed Color 4 object (at 28,36) changed to Color 11 (light grey) upon ACTION2, indicating an interaction or state change for this object type. This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.
  - Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element. This reinforces that the UI is highly dynamic and likely represents overall game state, rather than just movement counters. The Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7,0) also disappeared.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.
  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.
  - The black 'player' block changes color (color 14 to 12) upon moving, implying a state change associated with movement.
  - The multi-colored borders (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow) likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.
  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.
  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.
  - The assumed 'player' block changes color (from Color 14 to Color 12, or just Color 8 here) upon successful movement, implying a state change associated with movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)
  - The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.
  - The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.
  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).
  - ACTION1 had no effect, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. (This specific instance of no effect happened before the observed object-level changes).
  - ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. However, ACTION1 did trigger UI changes.
  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm if other moves are also 4 units or if some are 1 unit).
  - The player block (Color 8) maintains its current color (Color 8) upon successful movement downwards, indicating previous hypotheses about color changes with movement were either specific to other directions/actions, or were incorrect.

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Color 3 (green) irregularly shaped blocks

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area)
      Evidence: It is the largest area where other objects are placed and move.
  - Player/Movable Block: Color 8 (black) U-shaped block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)
      Evidence: It was the object that moved when ACTION2 was performed. It disappeared from (28, 24) and reappeared at (32, 24), confirming its movement. Its color remains Color 8, contradicting previous hypotheses about color changes for this specific action.
  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Obstacles or static environment features)
      Evidence: Previously observed to block player movement. They did not move in this action.
  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible or a target)
      Evidence: Its small size and distinct color suggest it might be something to collect or interact with.
  - Grey block: Color 4 (gray) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, potentially a switch or trigger)
      Evidence: An irregular shape (12x8) at (40, 28) and another (8x8) at (44, 44) appeared after ACTION2, suggesting they are revealed or activated by player action. One object at (28,36) previously color 4, changed to color 11, indicating an interaction.
  - Light Pink UI element (vertical): Color 14 (light pink) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker)
      Evidence: Appeared at (8,4) after ACTION2, replacing a different Color 14 UI element. It's separate from the play area and changes with game state.
  - Purple/Magenta UI element (top): Color 13 (magenta) Irregular shape (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker)
      Evidence: A Color 13 irregular shape (64x7) at (0,0) disappeared, indicating UI changes occur with actions.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?
  - What is the precise pattern of color changes for the 'Player/Movable Block' (Color 8, previously Color 14, then Color 12 and 8 in earlier descriptions)? Is it a sequence, or are there different player types/states with distinct colors? Can it be multiple colors at once, or does it change state based on interaction?
  - What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed, suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).
  - Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?
  - What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION1 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction for the supposed target object. And what specific movement directions does ACTION5 attempt?
  - What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?
  - What is the significance of the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) appearing at (4,8) after ACTION1, and the Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8,4) disappearing? Does this indicate a 'turn' change or a 'power-up' state?
  - What is the role of the newly appeared 'grey' (Color 4) objects and the Color 11 object? Are they collectibles, triggers, or score points?
  - Do all player movements occur in 4-unit increments, or does it vary by action/direction?

  - Object at (28, 36): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - The UI elements (Color 14 blocks) change even when the player's action (moving) has no effect. This suggests the UI elements track that an action was *attempted* or *taken*, not just that it was successful.
  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the 'Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8)' and disappearance of the 'Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)' indicates a complex UI state where the UI element shifts its position and orientation, potentially from a vertical bar on the left to a horizontal bar at the top.
  - The player block (Color 8) does not change color upon successful movement, contradicting a previous hypothesis. It remains Color 8.
  - The UI element changes are more complex than previously understood, involving multiple Color 13, Color 14, and Color 12 blocks disappearing and appearing, and other Color 4 objects in the play area possibly changing or moving. This suggests a broader 'turn' or 'game state' update rather than just simple move counters for the player block.
  - The object at (28, 36) changing color from 4 to 11 indicates that other objects in the play area can be affected by the action, not just the player block and UI elements.
