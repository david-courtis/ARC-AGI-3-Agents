  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 attempts to interact with an object (likely a collectible/trigger) and, regardless of whether it causes primary object movement, it triggers significant UI changes (Color 14 and Color 13 elements) and can also cause state changes (appearance/disappearance of Color 11 blocks).\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units down, without changing its color. This action also causes complex UI changes, including the disappearance of certain UI elements and the appearance of new 'grey' (Color 4) interactive objects, and the color change of existing Color 4 objects to Color 11.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the presumed player object (Color 8 rectangular block) one unit to the left in each animation frame until it moves a total of 4 units, or until it hits an obstacle/border. This action also triggers changes in the UI elements: specific Color 14 UI elements disappear and new ones appear.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units to the right. Also causes the Color 14 UI element to reposition.\n  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red-brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple (Aqua, Blue, Green, Yellow))\n  Description: A complex border system. An outer aqua (Color 10) single-pixel line forms the perimeter, enclosing blue (Color 9) borders on the top and left sides and green (Color 3) borders on the bottom and right sides. A yellow (Color 12) border is at the very bottom, outside the aqua border. There is now also a pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the top boundary.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A square play area enclosed by multiple borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks and dynamic UI elements separate from the main play area. There is a perceptible grid-like movement for the player, likely in 4-unit increments.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.\n  - Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.\n  - Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.\n  - Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).\n  - Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.\n  - The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.\n  - Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.\n  - Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.\n  - ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.\n  - Player block (Color 8) can move downwards by 4 units without changing color. This contradicts earlier hypotheses about mandatory color changes upon movement, suggesting color changes are not universal for all player movements. This also establishes a 4-unit movement increment for at least the 'down' action.\n  - New 'grey' (Color 4) objects appear upon successful player movement (ACTION2). This suggests these are either collectibles or triggerable elements, adding complexity to the game goal beyond simple movement.\n  - A previously observed Color 4 object (at 28,36) changed to Color 11 (light grey) upon ACTION2, indicating an interaction or state change for this object type. This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.\n  - Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element. This reinforces that the UI is highly dynamic and likely represents overall game state, rather than just movement counters. The Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7,0) also disappeared.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION1 had an effect on the environment, specifically the UI. Previously it was understood to have no effect on the play area, but now we see a significant UI change, and a new Color 11 object appearing in the play area.\n  - The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28)' (previously Color 4) disappeared, and a new 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' appeared. This confirms that Color 4 objects transform into Color 11 objects upon interaction, and that these Color 11 objects can then be further interacted with or disappear.\n  - The Color 14 UI element continues its highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical (4x48) block at (8,56) to a horizontal (48x4) block at (4,8). This strengthens the hypothesis that it's a critical, multi-state UI indicator, possibly related to turns or available actions.\n  - A new pink (Color 14) block has formed a new top border, indicating borders are dynamic and can be reconfigured or extended based on game state or actions.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.\n  - The black 'player' block changes color (color 14 to 12) upon moving, implying a state change associated with movement.\n  - The multi-colored borders (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow) likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - The assumed 'player' block changes color (from Color 14 to Color 12, or just Color 8 here) upon successful movement, implying a state change associated with movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)\n  - The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. (This specific instance of no effect happened before the observed object-level changes).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. However, ACTION1 did trigger UI changes.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm if other moves are also 4 units or if some are 1 unit).\n  - The player block (Color 8) maintains its current color (Color 8) upon successful movement downwards, indicating previous hypotheses about color changes with movement were either specific to other directions/actions, or were incorrect.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2, ACTION3 and ACTION4.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) irregularly shaped blocks\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area)\n      Evidence: It is the largest area where other objects are placed and move.\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 8 (black) U-shaped block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)\n      Evidence: It has been observed to move in response to actions and its previous color changes. It is the target of ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5.\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Obstacles or static environment features)\n      Evidence: These blocks are static and prevent movement of the player block through them. They have not moved or changed color with any observed action.\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible or a target)\n      Evidence: Its small size and distinct color suggest it might be something the player needs to collect or interact with, similar to common game design patterns.\n  - Grey interactive block (State 1): Color 4 (gray) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, potentially a switch or trigger)\n      Evidence: New blocks of this color appeared upon successful player movement (ACTION2). Another object of this type was observed to change to Color 11 upon interaction/player movement.\n  - Light grey interactive block (State 2): Color 11 (light grey) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, a 'triggered' or 'collected' state of a Color 4 block)\n      Evidence: A Color 4 block at (28,36) changed to Color 11 at (28,28) after ACTION2, and now another Color 11 block at (48,28) has appeared. This suggests it is a transformed state of the 'Grey interactive block'.\n  - Top UI element: Color 14 (light pink) Horizontal rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker)\n      Evidence: This element appeared at (4,8) after ACTION1, replacing a vertical Color 14 element. Its position at the top and its dynamic nature suggest it's a UI indicator, possibly for a turn, move count, or global game state.\n  - Magenta UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Irregular shape (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker)\n      Evidence: It reliably appears or changes with actions, separate from the main play area, indicating it's an UI element. It was observed to disappear in response to ACTION2.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow, and now pink)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n  - What is the precise pattern of color changes for the 'Player/Movable Block' (Color 8)? Is it a sequence, or are there different player types/states with distinct colors? Can it be multiple colors at once, or does it change state based on interaction?\n  - What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed, suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).\n  - Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n  - What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION1 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction for the supposed target object.\n  - What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n  - What is the significance of the appearance of a Color 11 block (4x4) at (48,28) and the disappearance of the Color 11 block (4x4) at (28,28)? Is this movement, 'collection', or a state change triggered by ACTION1?\n  - Do all player movements occur in 4-unit increments, or does it vary by action/direction?\n  - What is the role of the orange block (Color 2)?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (new): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 13 irregular shape (64x7) at (0, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8) at (40, 28): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8) at (44, 44): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Object at (28, 36): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The object at (28, 36) changing color from 4 to 11 indicates that other objects in the play area can be affected by the action, not just the player block and UI elements.\n  - The primary movable block or 'player' is now identified as the 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4)'. This contradicts previous analyses that identified Color 8 as the player. It is possible the player can change color or that the 'player' was incorrectly identified earlier.\n  - ACTION1 successfully moved the player block upwards by 4 units, confirming its role as 'Move UP'.\n  - Player movement occurs in 4-unit increments for upward movement as well.\n  - The UI elements continue to be highly dynamic, with the 'Color 14' element shifting from a vertical bar on the right side to a horizontal bar at the top, and a new Color 11 element appearing.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

An outer aqua (Color 10) single-pixel line forms the perimeter, enclosing blue (Color 9) borders on the top and left sides and green (Color 3) borders on the bottom and right sides. A yellow (Color 12) border is at the very bottom, outside the aqua border. There is now also a pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the top boundary.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A square play area enclosed by multiple borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks and dynamic UI elements separate from the main play area. There is a perceptible grid-like movement for the player, likely in 4-unit increments.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.\n  - Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.\n  - Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.\n  - Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).\n  - Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.\n  - The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.\n  - Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.\n  - Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.\n  - ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.\n  - Player block (Color 8) can move downwards by 4 units without changing color. This contradicts earlier hypotheses about mandatory color changes upon movement, suggesting color changes are not universal for all player movements. This also establishes a 4-unit movement increment for at least the 'down' action.\n  - New 'grey' (Color 4) objects appear upon successful player movement (ACTION2). This suggests these are either collectibles or triggerable elements, adding complexity to the game goal beyond simple movement.\n  - A previously observed Color 4 object (at 28,36) changed to Color 11 (light grey) upon ACTION2, indicating an interaction or state change for this object type. This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.\n  - Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element. This reinforces that the UI is highly dynamic and likely represents overall game state, rather than just movement counters. The Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7,0) also disappeared.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION1 had an effect on the environment, specifically the UI. Previously it was understood to have no effect on the play area, but now we see a significant UI change, and a new Color 11 object appearing in the play area.\n  - The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28)' (previously Color 4) disappeared, and a new 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' appeared. This confirms that Color 4 objects transform into Color 11 objects upon interaction, and that these Color 11 objects can then be further interacted with or disappear.\n  - The Color 14 UI element continues its highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical (4x48) block at (8,56) to a horizontal (48x4) block at (4,8). This strengthens the hypothesis that it's a critical, multi-state UI indicator, possibly related to turns or available actions.\n  - A new pink (Color 14) block has formed a new top border, indicating borders are dynamic and can be reconfigured or extended based on game state or actions.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.\n  - The black 'player' block changes color (color 14 to 12) upon moving, implying a state change associated with movement.\n  - The multi-colored borders (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow) likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - The assumed 'player' block changes color (from Color 14 to Color 12, or just Color 8 here) upon successful movement, implying a state change associated with movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)\n  - The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. (This specific instance of no effect happened before the observed object-level changes).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. However, ACTION1 did trigger UI changes.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm if other moves are also 4 units or if some are 1 unit).\n  - The player block (Color 8) maintains its current color (Color 8) upon successful movement downwards, indicating previous hypotheses about color changes with movement were either specific to other directions/actions, or were incorrect.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2, ACTION3 and ACTION4.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) irregularly shaped blocks\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area)\n      Evidence: It is the largest area where other objects are placed and move.\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 8 (black) U-shaped block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)\n      Evidence: It has been observed to move in response to actions and its previous color changes. It is the target of ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5.\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Obstacles or static environment features)\n      Evidence: These blocks are static and prevent movement of the player block through them. They have not moved or changed color with any observed action.\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible or a target)\n      Evidence: Its small size and distinct color suggest it might be something the player needs to collect or interact with, similar to common game design patterns.\n  - Grey interactive block (State 1): Color 4 (gray) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, potentially a switch or trigger)\n      Evidence: New blocks of this color appeared upon successful player movement (ACTION2). Another object of this type was observed to change to Color 11 upon interaction/player movement.\n  - Light grey interactive block (State 2): Color 11 (light grey) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, a 'triggered' or 'collected' state of a Color 4 block)\n      Evidence: A Color 4 block at (28,36) changed to Color 11 at (28,28) after ACTION2, and now another Color 11 block at (48,28) has appeared. This suggests it is a transformed state of the 'Grey interactive block'.\n  - Top UI element: Color 14 (light pink) Horizontal rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker)\n      Evidence: This element appeared at (4,8) after ACTION1, replacing a vertical Color 14 element. Its position at the top and its dynamic nature suggest it's a UI indicator, possibly for a turn, move count, or global game state.\n  - Magenta UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Irregular shape (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker)\n      Evidence: It reliably appears or changes with actions, separate from the main play area, indicating it's an UI element. It was observed to disappear in response to ACTION2.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow, and now pink)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n  - What is the precise pattern of color changes for the 'Player/Movable Block' (Color 8)? Is it a sequence, or are there different player types/states with distinct colors? Can it be multiple colors at once, or does it change state based on interaction?\n  - What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed, suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).\n  - Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n  - What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION1 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction for the supposed target object.\n  - What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n  - What is the significance of the appearance of a Color 11 block (4x4) at (48,28) and the disappearance of the Color 11 block (4x4) at (28,28)? Is this movement, 'collection', or a state change triggered by ACTION1?\n  - Do all player movements occur in 4-unit increments, or does it vary by action/direction?\n  - What is the role of the orange block (Color 2)?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (new): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 13 irregular shape (64x7) at (0, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8) at (40, 28): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8) at (44, 44): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Object at (28, 36): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The object at (28, 36) changing color from 4 to 11 indicates that other objects in the play area can be affected by the action, not just the player block and UI elements.\n  - The primary movable block or 'player' is now identified as the 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4)'. This contradicts previous analyses that identified Color 8 as the player. It is possible the player can change color or that the 'player' was incorrectly identified earlier.\n  - ACTION1 successfully moved the player block upwards by 4 units, confirming its role as 'Move UP'.\n  - Player movement occurs in 4-unit increments for upward movement as well.\n  - The UI elements continue to be highly dynamic, with the 'Color 14' element shifting from a vertical bar on the right side to a horizontal bar at the top, and a new Color 11 element appearing.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 2 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION5: 1 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."

    "reasoning": "ACTION5 has only been attempted once and resulted in 'NO EFFECT'. It is a high-priority action to test, as it's not well understood. The current 'Player/Movable Block' is clearly identified as the Color 8 L-shaped block. It is not currently against a border or obviously blocked by a 'landmass' (Color 3). Although 'Legacy Objects' still mention 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4)' as the player, that is based on the LAST observation, but in the CURRENT image, the player is clearly the Color 8 block. Therefore, testing ACTION5 again in this new, more open position, with a clearly identified player block (Color 8), is a good strategy. No setup sequence is needed because the player is currently in what appears to be an open space, allowing us to directly test ACTION5 and see if it interacts with the orange block (Color 2) or the grey block (Color 4) nearby, or functions as a general 'interact' action.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to either confirm 'no effect' again, or observe how ACTION5 interacts with the identified 'Player/Movable Block' (Color 8) and nearby interactive elements (Color 2 orange block, Color 4 grey block). This will clarify its function, which is currently unknown. If it moves the player, we will identify its direction. If it interacts, we will identify what it interacts with. If it still has no effect, it will further validate that it requires a specific context or position.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The 'Player/Movable Block' is currently the Color 8 L-shaped block, located in a relatively open area. There are 'Green landmass' (Color 3) blocks nearby, as well as a 'Grey interactive block' (Color 4) and an 'Orange block' (Color 2). The player is not visibly against any border elements (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow). This state is suitable for testing new actions or re-testing actions that previously had 'no effect' due to potential contextual reasons, as the current position is distinct from where ACTION5 was last attempted (which was previously identified as the Color 8 rectangular block at unknown position)."
