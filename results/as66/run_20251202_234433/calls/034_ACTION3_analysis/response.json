The animation frames show this block moving smoothly to the left. The UI elements also changed: the 'Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8)' (right UI element) disappeared, and a 'Color 14 rectangular block (4x48)' appeared at (8, 4) (left UI element).",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (20, 40)' (the player block) had clear, unobstructed space directly to its left, allowing it to move 4 units to the left. No obstacles (like green 'landmass' blocks) or borders prevented its movement in this direction. The previous association of ACTION3 with 'Move LEFT' is reinforced.",
