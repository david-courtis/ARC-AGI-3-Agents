  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has been tested only once and has 1/3 consistent observations. While ACTION1 has 0/3 observations, it had a recent \"no effect\" attempt, meaning we would need a setup sequence to move the player first. ACTION3 currently provides the most consistent observation. We should prioritize validating actions with fewer consistent observations that do not require a setup sequence first. The player is currently at (16,40) (black block). Moving right will take it out of the corner and into a more central position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm if ACTION4 consistently moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the right and observe any associated UI changes. This will help reach 2/3 consistent observations for ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 11) is currently at (16,40). It is not against a border that would directly block rightward movement, and there are no immediate green obstacles to the right. The pink 'Left UI element' (Color 14) is at (8,4). This state is suitable for testing ACTION4 without a setup sequence."
