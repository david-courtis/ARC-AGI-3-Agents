- The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.
- The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.
- The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.
- The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.
- The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.
- ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic). ACTION5 attempts to move the Color 8 player block at (24,12), which is surrounded by Color 6 (red-brown) and Color 3 (green) to its left. Its lack of effect implies blockage in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), considering its specific position (24,12) with green obstacles nearby and the blue border to the left.
- ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. However, ACTION1 did trigger UI changes.
- Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2, ACTION3 and ACTION4.
