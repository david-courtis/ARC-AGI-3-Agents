    "Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?",
    "What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION1 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction for the supposed target object.",
    "What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?",
    "What is the significance of the appearance of a Color 11 block (4x4) at (48,28) and the disappearance of the Color 11 block (4x4) at (28,28)? Is this movement, 'collection', or a state change triggered by ACTION1?",
