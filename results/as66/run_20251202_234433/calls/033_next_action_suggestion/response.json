  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has only one attempt and no consistent observations. It is a movement action, which is generally safe to test from any position, assuming no immediate obstructions. Critically, we have identified that the player block is Color 11, and the previous observation for ACTION3 involved a Color 8 block. Retesting ACTION3 with the correct player block identification is crucial to verify its effect. We are prioritizing actions that have been tested the least to gather more data and aim for verification.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm if ACTION3 moves the Color 11 player block to the left by 4 units and to further understand the associated UI changes (Color 14 and Color 13 elements) with this action, given the player block is now consistently identified as Color 11. This will provide more data towards verifying ACTION3's effect.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 11) is currently at (32, 36). It is not directly adjacent to any green obstacles, so it should be free to move left. There have been no 'no effect' attempts for ACTION3 with the current player block (Color 11), so a setup sequence is not immediately required. The current state is suitable for testing ACTION3."
