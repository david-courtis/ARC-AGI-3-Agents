ACTION2: ACTION2 moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units down, without changing its color. This action also causes complex UI changes, including the disappearance of certain UI elements and the appearance of new 'grey' (Color 4) interactive objects, and the color change of existing Color 4 objects to Color 11.
  Reason: Previous understanding hinted at color changes for player movement, but this observation confirms the Color 8 player block explicitly did NOT change color upon moving. It also reveals the appearance of new interactive objects (Color 4) and state changes (Color 4 to 11) in the play area, which are critical effects of this action missed before.
