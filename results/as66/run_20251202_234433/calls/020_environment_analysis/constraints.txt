- The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.
- The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.
- The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.
- ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).
- ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. However, ACTION1 did trigger UI changes.
- Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm if other moves are also 4 units or if some are 1 unit).
- The player block (Color 8) maintains its current color (Color 8) upon successful movement downwards, indicating previous hypotheses about color changes with movement were either specific to other directions/actions, or were incorrect.
