BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective.

This suggests an independent UI layer.\n- Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n- Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.\n- Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.\n- Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).\n- Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.\n- The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.\n- Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.\n- Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.\n- Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.\n- ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n- What is the precise pattern of color changes for the 'Player/Movable Block' (Color 8, previously Color 14, then Color 12 and 8 in earlier descriptions)? Is it a sequence, or are there different player types/states with distinct colors? Can it be multiple colors at once, or does it change state based on interaction?\n- What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed, suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).\n- Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n- What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION1 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction for the supposed target object. And what specific movement directions does ACTION5 attempt?\n- What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n- What is the significance of the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) appearing at (4,8) after ACTION1, and the Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8,4) disappearing? Does this indicate a 'turn' change or a 'power-up' state?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 attempts to move an object (likely the player), and regardless of success in movement, it triggers a change in the Color 14 UI element, indicating a transition in game state or turn.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 attempts to move the player block (Color 8) down by 4 units. If successful, the player block moves down WITHOUT changing its color. This action triggers significant changes in UI elements, including various Color 13, Color 14 and Color 12 blocks appearing or disappearing, and other Color 4 objects moving or appearing.\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 moves the presumed player object (Color 8 rectangular block) one unit to the left in each animation frame until it moves a total of 4 units, or until it hits an obstacle/border. This action also triggers changes in the UI elements: specific Color 14 UI elements disappear and new ones appear.\"\n  ACTION4: \"Moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units to the right. Also causes the Color 14 UI element to reposition.\"\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
