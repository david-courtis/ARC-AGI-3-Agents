1. Player block (Color 8) can move downwards by 4 units without changing color. This contradicts earlier hypotheses about mandatory color changes upon movement, suggesting color changes are not universal for all player movements. This also establishes a 4-unit movement increment for at least the 'down' action.
2. New 'grey' (Color 4) objects appear upon successful player movement (ACTION2). This suggests these are either collectibles or triggerable elements, adding complexity to the game goal beyond simple movement.
3. A previously observed Color 4 object (at 28,36) changed to Color 11 (light grey) upon ACTION2, indicating an interaction or state change for this object type. This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.
4. Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element. This reinforces that the UI is highly dynamic and likely represents overall game state, rather than just movement counters. The Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7,0) also disappeared.
