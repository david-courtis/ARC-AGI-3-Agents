ACTION2: ACTION2 attempts to move a specific object (likely the player block) down. If successful, the player block moves down and changes its color (e.g., from 14 to 12). Simultaneously, UI elements appear/change in the top area (Color 13 rectangular block at (0, 25) and Color 14 rectangular block at (56, 8)). The appearance of these UI elements acts as a reliable indicator of a successful action that affects game state.
  Reason: The action caused a visible change in the player block's color in addition to its movement. The appearance of the two clearly distinct UI elements upon action success is a new piece of evidence, indicating these are tied to successful actions.
