1. Confirmed that ACTION1 had an effect on the environment, specifically the UI. Previously it was understood to have no effect on the play area, but now we see a significant UI change, and a new Color 11 object appearing in the play area.
2. The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28)' (previously Color 4) disappeared, and a new 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' appeared. This confirms that Color 4 objects transform into Color 11 objects upon interaction, and that these Color 11 objects can then be further interacted with or disappear.
3. The Color 14 UI element continues its highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical (4x48) block at (8,56) to a horizontal (48x4) block at (4,8). This strengthens the hypothesis that it's a critical, multi-state UI indicator, possibly related to turns or available actions.
4. A new pink (Color 14) block has formed a new top border, indicating borders are dynamic and can be reconfigured or extended based on game state or actions.
