ACTION1: ACTION1 attempts to interact with an object (likely a collectible/trigger) and, regardless of whether it causes primary object movement, it triggers significant UI changes (Color 14 and Color 13 elements) and can also cause state changes (appearance/disappearance of Color 11 blocks).
  Reason: Previous understanding stated ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, but new evidence shows it caused a Color 11 rectangular block to appear at (48,28) and the one at (28,28) to disappear, alongside major UI changes where a vertical Color 14 UI element disappeared and a horizontal one appeared, and a magenta UI element also disappeared. This implies a significant effect beyond just a failed move.
