    "The Color 14 UI element continues its highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical (4x48) block at (8,56) to a horizontal (48x4) block at (4,8). This strengthens the hypothesis that it's a critical, multi-state UI indicator, possibly related to turns or available actions.",

    "What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed, suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).",
    "Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?",
    "What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION1 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction for the supposed target object.",
    "What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?",
    "What is the significance of the appearance of a Color 11 block (4x4) at (48,28) and the disappearance of the Color 11 block (4x4) at (28,28)? Is this movement, 'collection', or a state change triggered by ACTION1?",
    "Do all player movements occur in 4-unit increments, or does it vary by action/direction?",

  "suggested_action_updates": [
    {
      "action_id": "ACTION1",
      "suggested_definition": "ACTION1 attempts to interact with an object (likely a collectible/trigger) and, regardless of whether it causes primary object movement, it triggers significant UI changes (Color 14 and Color 13 elements) and can also cause state changes (appearance/disappearance of Color 11 blocks).",
      "reasoning": "Previous understanding stated ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, but new evidence shows it caused a Color 11 rectangular block to appear at (48,28) and the one at (28,28) to disappear, alongside major UI changes where a vertical Color 14 UI element disappeared and a horizontal one appeared, and a magenta UI element also disappeared. This implies a significant effect beyond just a failed move."
