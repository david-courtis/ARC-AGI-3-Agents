1. Player Color Confirmed to be Color 11: The player block is now unequivocally identified as Color 11 based on direct observation of its movement. This corrects previous hypotheses about its color (Color 8, Color 14, Color 12). Its color changes state, and currently it is Color 11. Previous descriptions identified 'Color 11' as an 'interactive object (state 2)', implying the player block has adopted this 'state' by changing its color to 11.
2. ACTION1 functionality clarified: ACTION1 successfully moved the player block (now Color 11) upwards by 4 units. This refutes the previous understanding that ACTION1 'had no effect on the play area' and only triggered UI changes. ACTION1 can indeed move the player. The previous observation of 'no effect' on the play area must have been due to an obstruction, not a fundamental property of ACTION1.
3. Borders are actively reconfigured: The Color 14 UI element has fully transformed into a top border (48x4 block at (4,8)) and the single-pixel pink line at (0,0), replacing its previous 'vertical bar on the right' form. This reinforces that borders are not just static boundaries but dynamically generated UI that can change orientation and placement.
