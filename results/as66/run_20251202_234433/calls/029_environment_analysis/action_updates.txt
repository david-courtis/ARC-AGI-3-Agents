ACTION1: ACTION1 moves the player block (currently identified as Color 11) 4 units upwards, provided there is no obstruction. Regardless of player movement success, it triggers significant UI changes, specifically causing the 'Color 14' UI element to shift its position and orientation (e.g., from a vertical bar on the right to a horizontal bar at the top or forming a top border).
  Reason: Previous observations indicated ACTION1 had 'no effect on the play area' but changed UI. This new observation clearly shows ACTION1 moved the player block, demonstrating it *can* move the player. The 'no effect' previously was likely due to blockage.
