ACTION3: ACTION3 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left, provided there is no obstruction. It also triggers corresponding UI changes, specifically causing the 'Color 14' UI element to shift its position and orientation, such as from a right-side vertical bar to a left-side vertical bar.
  Reason: Observed ACTION3 directly moving the player block 4 units left. The UI changes observed are consistent with the dynamic behavior of the Color 14 UI element seen in previous actions.
