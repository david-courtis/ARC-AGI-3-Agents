- The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.
- The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.
- The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.
- The assumed 'player' block changes color (from Color 14 to Color 12, or just Color 8 here) upon successful movement, implying a state change associated with movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)
- ACTION1 had no effect, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. (This specific instance of no effect happened before the observed object-level changes).
- ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).
