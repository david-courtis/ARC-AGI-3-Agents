1. Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.
2. ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.
