Is it a sequence, or are there different player types/states with distinct colors? Can it be multiple colors at once, or does it change state based on interaction?",
    "What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed, suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).",
    "Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?",
    "What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION1 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction for the supposed target object. And what specific movement directions does ACTION5 attempt?",
    "What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?",
    "What is the significance of the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) appearing at (4,8) after ACTION1, and the Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8,4) disappearing? Does this indicate a 'turn' change or a 'power-up' state?"
