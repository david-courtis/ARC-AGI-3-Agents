Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)\n2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)\n3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to\ndiscover context-dependent behaviors."

    "reasoning": "ACTION1 had 'NO EFFECT' in the current state, so we cannot test it again without a setup sequence. Since we have no verified actions, we cannot use a setup sequence at this time. Therefore, we must choose an action that has not been observed yet. ACTION2 is the next in the list of unobserved actions.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We will learn what ACTION2 does. As per semantic hints, it might be 'Move DOWN'. Given that ACTION1 did not behave as 'Move UP', it is crucial to observe if ACTION2 has any effect and if it aligns with the 'Move DOWN' hint. This will also help us understand if there's an active object or specific context needed for movement actions.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is largely unknown regarding action effects. We have a clear understanding of the visual elements, but their interaction with proposed actions is yet to be fully explored. The previous attempt with ACTION1 yielded 'NO EFFECT', indicating that either the action is context-dependent, mislabeled by the hint, or requires object selection first. With no verified actions to create a setup sequence, testing a completely new action (ACTION2) is the most logical step toward discovery."
