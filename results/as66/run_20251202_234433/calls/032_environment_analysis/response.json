While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed (previously observed), suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).",
    "Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?",
