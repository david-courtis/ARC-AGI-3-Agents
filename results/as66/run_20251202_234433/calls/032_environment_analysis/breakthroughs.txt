1. Confirmed that the primary Color 14 UI element is highly dynamic, not only changing orientation but also relocating entirely, in this case from a top border (48x4 at (4,8)) to a right border (48x4 at (56,8)). This reinforces its role as a complex state indicator.
2. The player block (Color 11) successfully moved 4 units upwards, confirming that ACTION2 moves the player block upwards, despite previous semantic hints. It also confirms the player block maintained its Color 11 state after moving.
3. Correction in previous breakthrough: The 'Top UI element' that was a 48x4 pink block at (4,8) is now identified as a 'Right UI element' which is also a 48x4 pink block but at (56,8). This shows a transformation and relocation, not just a border extension.
