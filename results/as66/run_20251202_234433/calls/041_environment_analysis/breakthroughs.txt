1. Player color confirmed to be Color 11: The player block, which moved, is definitively Color 11. This refines its role as 'Player/Movable Block' and confirms it can have at least two observed color states (Color 8 and Color 11), suggesting a state-management mechanic via color changes.
2. New UI element formation: A Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4,8) appeared, becoming a 'Top UI element' which is distinct from the single pixel pink line at (0,0). This reinforces the concept of dynamic and multi-component UI elements for Color 14.
