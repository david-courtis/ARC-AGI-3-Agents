While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed (previously observed), suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).",
    "Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?",
    "What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 11)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?",
    "What is the role of the orange block (Color 2)?",
    "How many distinct states/colors can the player block have, and what triggers transitions between them?",
    "What is the ultimate goal of the game, given the dynamic UI elements, interactive objects, and player movement?"
