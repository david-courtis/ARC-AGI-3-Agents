BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective.

However, ACTION1 can still trigger UI changes regardless of play area object movement.\n  - ACTION5 and ACTION1 (when the player block is obstructed) indicate that the player block is blocked by either game boundaries or internal obstacles when an action has no effect on its position in the play area.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8 or Color 11) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - ACTION5 and other 'no effect' actions are strong evidence that the player block is blocked by either boundaries or internal obstacles when an attempted move does not result in a position change.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments in all observed successful moves (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4).\nIdentified objects:\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role: The main play area)\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 11 (light grey) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role: Obstacles or static environment features)\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (4x4) (Role: Collectible or a target)\n  - Light grey interactive object (State 2): Color 11 (light grey) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role: Interactive element, a 'triggered' or 'collected' state of a separate object type (e.g., Color 4) or an activated power-up.)\n  - Top UI element (pink line): Color 14 (light pink) Horizontal line (1x64) (Role: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, possibly a turn counter or available action indicator.)\n  - Magenta UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Irregular shape (2x2 square) (Role: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, potentially a 'turn' or 'energy' indicator.)\n  - Grey interactive object (State 1): Color 4 (gray) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role: Interactive element, potentially a switch or trigger that changes to Color 11 upon interaction.)\n  - Left UI element: Color 14 (light pink) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker, possibly a turn counter or available action indicator.)\nSpatial structure: A square play area enclosed by multiple dynamically reconfiguring borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks. There is a perceptible grid-like movement for the player, likely in 4-unit increments. UI elements are outside the main play area and highly dynamic.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.\n- Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n- Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.\n- Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.\n- Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).\n- Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.\n- The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.\n- Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.\n- Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.\n- Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.\n- ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.\n- Player block (Color 8) can move downwards by 4 units without changing color. This contradicts earlier hypotheses about mandatory color changes upon movement, suggesting color changes are not universal for all player movements. This also establishes a 4-unit movement increment for at least the 'down' action.\n- New 'grey' (Color 4) objects appear upon successful player movement (ACTION2). This suggests these are either collectibles or triggerable elements, adding complexity to the game goal beyond simple movement.\n- A previously observed Color 4 object (at 28,36) changed to Color 11 (light grey) upon ACTION2, indicating an interaction or state change for this object type. This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.\n- Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element. This reinforces that the UI is highly dynamic and likely represents overall game state, rather than just movement counters. The Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7,0) also disappeared.\n- Confirmed that ACTION1 had an effect on the environment, specifically the UI. Previously it was understood to have no effect on the play area, but now we see a significant UI change, and a new Color 11 object appearing in the play area.\n- The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28)' (previously Color 4) disappeared, and a new 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' appeared. This confirms that Color 4 objects transform into Color 11 objects upon interaction, and that these Color 11 objects can then be further interacted with or disappear.\n- The Color 14 UI element continues its highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical (4x48) block at (8,56) to a horizontal (48x4) block at (4,8). This strengthens the hypothesis that it's a critical, multi-state UI indicator, possibly related to turns or available actions.\n- A new pink (Color 14) block has formed a new top border, indicating borders are dynamic and can be reconfigured or extended based on game state or actions.\n- Confirmed that 'no effect' actions (specifically ACTION5 in this observation) are strong evidence for movement constraints, indicating the player block was blocked in the attempted direction(s) of the action.\n- Further reinforced the understanding that ACTION5 (and by extension, any 'no effect' action in the future) is evidence of surrounding boundaries or obstacles.\n- Player Color Confirmed to be Color 11: The player block is now unequivocally identified as Color 11 based on direct observation of its movement. This corrects previous hypotheses about its color (Color 8, Color 14, Color 12). Its color changes state, and currently it is Color 11. Previous descriptions identified 'Color 11' as an 'interactive object (state 2)', implying the player block has adopted this 'state' by changing its color to 11.\n- ACTION1 functionality clarified: ACTION1 successfully moved the player block (now Color 11) upwards by 4 units. This refutes the previous understanding that ACTION1 'had no effect on the play area' and only triggered UI changes. ACTION1 can indeed move the player. The previous observation of 'no effect' on the play area must have been due to an obstruction, not a fundamental property of ACTION1.\n- Borders are actively reconfigured: The Color 14 UI element has fully transformed into a top border (48x4 block at (4,8)) and the single-pixel pink line at (0,0), replacing its previous 'vertical bar on the right' form. This reinforces that borders are not just static boundaries but dynamically generated UI that can change orientation and placement.\n- Confirmed that the primary Color 14 UI element is highly dynamic, not only changing orientation but also relocating entirely, in this case from a top border (48x4 at (4,8)) to a right border (48x4 at (56,8)). This reinforces its role as a complex state indicator.\n- The player block (Color 11) successfully moved 4 units upwards, confirming that ACTION2 moves the player block upwards, despite previous semantic hints. It also confirms the player block maintained its Color 11 state after moving.\n- Correction in previous breakthrough: The 'Top UI element' that was a 48x4 pink block at (4,8) is now identified as a 'Right UI element' which is also a 48x4 pink block but at (56,8). This shows a transformation and relocation, not just a border extension.\n- Confirmed that ACTION3 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left. This clarifies its primary function and confirms consistent 4-unit movement for at least three actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3).\n- Further observed the dynamic nature of the Color 14 UI element: it transformed from a 'Right UI element' (48x4 block at (56,8)) to a 'Left UI element' (4x48 block at (8,4)), reinforcing its role as a complex, multi-state indicator that reconfigures itself across the screen.\n- ACTION4 functionality clarified: ACTION4 successfully moved the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left, which corrects the previous understanding of ACTION4 as moving right. This clarifies its primary function when unobstructed.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow, and now pink)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n- What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed (previously observed), suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).\n- Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n- What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 11)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n- What is the role of the orange block (Color 2)?\n- How many distinct states/colors can the player block have, and what triggers transitions between them?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 moves the player block (currently identified as Color 11) 4 units upwards, provided there is no obstruction. Regardless of player movement success, it triggers significant UI changes, specifically causing the 'Color 14' UI element to shift its position and orientation (e.g., from a vertical bar on the right to a horizontal bar at the top or forming a top border). The appearance of a second 'Color 11' block at (48,X) is likely a UI related event or an artifact of object detection.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units upwards. This action also causes complex UI changes, including the disappearance of a horizontal Color 14 UI element from the top and the appearance of a vertical Color 14 UI element on the right.\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left, provided there is no obstruction. It also triggers corresponding UI changes, specifically causing the 'Color 14' UI element to shift its position and orientation, such as from a right-side vertical bar to a left-side vertical bar.\"\n  ACTION4: \"ACTION4 moves the player block (Color 11) 4 units to the left, provided there is no obstruction. It also causes the Color 14 UI element to reposition from the left side to the right side of the screen.\"\n  ACTION5: \"ACTION5 appears to be a 'no-op' when the player block is in certain states or positions, or when there are no interactable objects in its vicinity. It does not trigger any visible movement or object transformation.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
