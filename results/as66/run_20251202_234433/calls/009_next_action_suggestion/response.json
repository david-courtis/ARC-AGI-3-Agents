  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has never been observed, so it's a high priority. The current position of the 'player' (Color 8 black block) is in the middle of the screen, away from immediate obstacles to the right. This provides a good opportunity to observe if ACTION4 (Move RIGHT) has an effect. We are not repeating a no-effect action in the same state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to determine if ACTION4 moves the player block, its direction, and any associated UI or color changes. This will help verify its semantic hint ('Move RIGHT') and contribute to further understanding of player movement mechanics and UI dynamics.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 8) is centrally located. It has green 'landmass' blocks above and to its right. The orange block is to its upper left. There seems to be enough clear space to the right for a short movement without hitting an obstacle immediately. This state is suitable for testing rightward movement."
