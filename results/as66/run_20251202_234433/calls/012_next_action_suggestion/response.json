  "target_action": "ACTION5",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has never been observed, making it the highest priority for initial testing. The current state has the player block (Color 8, black) somewhat centrally located and near a suspected collectible (Color 2, orange). This is as good a state as any to first observe what ACTION5 might do without prior knowledge of its function.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the fundamental effect of ACTION5. Potential outcomes include interaction with nearby objects (like the orange block), rotation of the player block, or a general game state change not related to movement.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 8) is positioned in the lower-middle part of the screen, with green 'landmass' blocks around it and the orange suspected collectible above and to its right. It's a relatively open area to test a new action. We don't need a setup sequence if we're testing an unobserved action, and the current position is not problematic for interaction or rotation type actions."
