  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 attempts to interact with an object (likely a collectible/trigger) and, regardless of whether it causes primary object movement, it triggers significant UI changes (Color 14 and Color 13 elements) and can also cause state changes (appearance/disappearance of Color 11 blocks).\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units down, without changing its color. This action also causes complex UI changes, including the disappearance of certain UI elements and the appearance of new 'grey' (Color 4) interactive objects, and the color change of existing Color 4 objects to Color 11.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the presumed player object (Color 8 rectangular block) one unit to the left in each animation frame until it moves a total of 4 units, or until it hits an obstacle/border. This action also triggers changes in the UI elements: specific Color 14 UI elements disappear and new ones appear.\n  ACTION4: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the player block (Color 8) 4 units to the right. Also causes the Color 14 UI element to reposition.\n  ACTION5: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION5 appears to be a 'no-op' when the player block is in certain states or positions, or when there are no interactable objects in its vicinity. It does not trigger any visible movement or object transformation.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (red-brown)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple)\n  Description: A complex border system. An outer aqua (Color 10) single-pixel line forms the perimeter, enclosing blue (Color 9) borders on the top and left sides and green (Color 3) borders on the bottom and right sides. A yellow (Color 12) border is at the very bottom, outside the aqua border. There is now also a pink (Color 14) horizontal line at the top boundary.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  A square play area enclosed by multiple borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks and dynamic UI elements separate from the main play area. There is a perceptible grid-like movement for the player, likely in 4-unit increments.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.\n  - Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n  - Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.\n  - Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.\n  - Player movement confirmed multiple directions: The Color 8 player block moved left, confirming it can move in at least two directions (down and left).\n  - Confirmed directional movement for the player block (Color 8) towards the right.\n  - The Color 14 UI element has been observed to move from the 'left' side to the 'right' side (from (8,4) to (8,56)), indicating it's a dynamic UI component that can shift position, possibly reflecting a different game state or turn.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.\n  - Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.\n  - Refined understanding of UI element Color 14: This element is highly dynamic, changing both its orientation (from vertical to horizontal) and its position (from left side to top UI area) even when a player action (ACTION1) had no effect on the play area. This strongly suggests it's not simply a 'left/right' UI element, but a flexible indicator responding to broader game state or turn changes, possibly indicating an available action or state for a subsequent turn rather than a direct consequence of a successful move.\n  - ACTION1 is confirmed to not just fail, but also triggers a UI change, indicating it is an action that changes the overall game state even if the primary game object fails to move. Previously it was reported as 'NO CHANGE', now new evidence shows UI changes.\n  - Player block (Color 8) can move downwards by 4 units without changing color. This contradicts earlier hypotheses about mandatory color changes upon movement, suggesting color changes are not universal for all player movements. This also establishes a 4-unit movement increment for at least the 'down' action.\n  - New 'grey' (Color 4) objects appear upon successful player movement (ACTION2). This suggests these are either collectibles or triggerable elements, adding complexity to the game goal beyond simple movement.\n  - A previously observed Color 4 object (at 28,36) changed to Color 11 (light grey) upon ACTION2, indicating an interaction or state change for this object type. This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.\n  - Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element. This reinforces that the UI is highly dynamic and likely represents overall game state, rather than just movement counters. The Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7,0) also disappeared.\n  - Confirmed that ACTION1 had an effect on the environment, specifically the UI. Previously it was understood to have no effect on the play area, but now we see a significant UI change, and a new Color 11 object appearing in the play area.\n  - The 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28)' (previously Color 4) disappeared, and a new 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' appeared. This confirms that Color 4 objects transform into Color 11 objects upon interaction, and that these Color 11 objects can then be further interacted with or disappear.\n  - The Color 14 UI element continues its highly dynamic behavior, transforming from a vertical (4x48) block at (8,56) to a horizontal (48x4) block at (4,8). This strengthens the hypothesis that it's a critical, multi-state UI indicator, possibly related to turns or available actions.\n  - A new pink (Color 14) block has formed a new top border, indicating borders are dynamic and can be reconfigured or extended based on game state or actions.\n  - Confirmed that 'no effect' actions (specifically ACTION5 in this observation) are strong evidence for movement constraints, indicating the player block was blocked in the attempted direction(s) of the action.\n  - Further reinforced the understanding that ACTION5 (and by extension, any 'no effect' action in the future) is evidence of surrounding boundaries or obstacles.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.\n  - The black 'player' block changes color (color 14 to 12) upon moving, implying a state change associated with movement.\n  - The multi-colored borders (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow) likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - The assumed 'player' block (Color 8) cannot move through the green 'landmass' blocks.\n  - The assumed 'player' block changes color (from Color 14 to Color 12, or just Color 8 here) upon successful movement, implying a state change associated with movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)\n  - The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. (This specific instance of no effect happened before the observed object-level changes).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect on the play area, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move. However, ACTION1 did trigger UI changes.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm if other moves are also 4 units or if some are 1 unit).\n  - The player block (Color 8) maintains its current color (Color 8) upon successful movement downwards, indicating previous hypotheses about color changes with movement were either specific to other directions/actions, or were incorrect.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2, ACTION3 and ACTION4.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic). ACTION5 attempts to move the Color 8 player block at (24,12), which is surrounded by Color 6 (red-brown) and Color 3 (green) to its left. Its lack of effect implies blockage in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), considering its specific position (24,12) with green obstacles nearby and the blue border to the left.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) irregularly shaped blocks\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area)\n      Evidence: It is the dominant color filling the central region where game objects are active.\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 8 (black) U-shaped block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)\n      Evidence: This object is the target of various actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5) that attempt to move it. Its position changes upon successful actions.\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Obstacles or static environment features)\n      Evidence: The player block cannot move through these blocks; they consistently block movement attempts. They are fixed in position.\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Collectible or a target)\n      Evidence: It is a distinct object within the play area, separate from obstacles, suggesting it may be something to be collected or interacted with.\n  - Light grey interactive object (State 2): Color 11 (light grey) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, a 'triggered' or 'collected' state of a separate object type (e.g., Color 4))\n      Evidence: Appeared after a successful player movement (ACTION2) and a Color 4 block disappeared in the same general area, implying a state change from another object type or interaction. Also, a Color 11 block disappeared while a new one appeared in a different location after ACTION1, further suggesting it's an interactive element that can be moved or change its position.\n  - Top UI element: Color 14 (light pink) Horizontal rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker)\n      Evidence: This element is located outside the main play area. Its orientation and position change dramatically and frequently even when the player's primary action has no effect on the play area, indicating it reflects broader game state or turn changes, not just successful moves.\n  - Magenta UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Irregular shape (2x2 square) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker)\n      Evidence: This element is located outside the main play area. It disappears and reappears with game actions (e.g., disappears after ACTION2), indicating it is part of the game's UI and tracks some aspect of the game state or progress.\n  - Grey interactive object (State 1): Color 4 (gray) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, potentially a switch or trigger)\n      Evidence: These objects appeared upon successful player movement (ACTION2) and one was observed to change to Color 11, indicating they are interactive and have a state transformation.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow, and now pink)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n  - What is the precise pattern of color changes for the 'Player/Movable Block' (Color 8)? Is it a sequence, or are there different player types/states with distinct colors? Can it be multiple colors at once, or does it change state based on interaction?\n  - What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed, suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).\n  - Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n  - What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION1 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction for the supposed target object.\n  - What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n  - What is the significance of the appearance of a Color 11 block (4x4) at (48,28) and the disappearance of the Color 11 block (4x4) at (28,28)? Is this movement, 'collection', or a state change triggered by ACTION1?\n  - Do all player movements occur in 4-unit increments, or does it vary by action/direction?\n  - What is the role of the orange block (Color 2)?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (new): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 13 irregular shape (64x7) at (0, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8) at (40, 28): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8) at (44, 44): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Object at (28, 36): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Player movement occurs in 4-unit increments for upward movement as well.\n  - The UI elements continue to be highly dynamic, with the 'Color 14' element shifting from a vertical bar on the right side to a horizontal bar at the top, and a new Color 11 element appearing.\n  - ACTION5 is confirmed to be a 'no-op' when the player (Color 11 block) is not interacting with anything, demonstrating its behavior when no valid 'interaction' or 'selection' target is present.\n  - The player block is still identified as 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4)' after previous observation.\n  - The 'Color 8 rectangular block (4x4)' is still present at (36, 12) but is not acting as the player block in this instance.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

This strengthens the hypothesis that Color 4 objects are interactive.\n  - Multiple, complex UI changes occurred in response to ACTION2, involving the disappearance of a Color 13 element and a Color 14 element (from its observed horizontal orientation), and the appearance of a new vertical Color 14 element.

(UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm the exact color change pattern of the player block, as it was described as Color 14 changing to Color 12, but is now Color 8 and moved.)\n  - The aqua (Color 10), blue (Color 9), green (Color 3), pink (Color 14), and yellow (Color 12) borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks (Color 3) appear to be static obstacles, blocking movement through them.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic).\n  - ACTION1 had no effect, implying the target object for ACTION1 was blocked by either a boundary or an obstacle, or the action attempted an impossible move.

(UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: More observation needed to confirm if other moves are also 4 units or if some are 1 unit).\n  - The player block (Color 8) maintains its current color (Color 8) upon successful movement downwards, indicating previous hypotheses about color changes with movement were either specific to other directions/actions, or were incorrect.\n  - Player movement appears to be constrained to 4-unit increments, as observed with ACTION2, ACTION3 and ACTION4.\n  - ACTION5 had no effect, suggesting the player block was either at a boundary or next to an obstacle in all four cardinal directions, or the action attempts an impossible move (e.g., diagonal, or into an occupied space with no 'push' mechanic). ACTION5 attempts to move the Color 8 player block at (24,12), which is surrounded by Color 6 (red-brown) and Color 3 (green) to its left. Its lack of effect implies blockage in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), considering its specific position (24,12) with green obstacles nearby and the blue border to the left.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) irregularly shaped blocks\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area)\n      Evidence: It is the dominant color filling the central region where game objects are active.\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 8 (black) U-shaped block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element)\n      Evidence: This object is the target of various actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5) that attempt to move it. Its position changes upon successful actions.\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Obstacles or static environment features)\n      Evidence: The player block cannot move through these blocks; they consistently block movement attempts. They are fixed in position.\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Collectible or a target)\n      Evidence: It is a distinct object within the play area, separate from obstacles, suggesting it may be something to be collected or interacted with.\n  - Light grey interactive object (State 2): Color 11 (light grey) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, a 'triggered' or 'collected' state of a separate object type (e.g., Color 4))\n      Evidence: Appeared after a successful player movement (ACTION2) and a Color 4 block disappeared in the same general area, implying a state change from another object type or interaction. Also, a Color 11 block disappeared while a new one appeared in a different location after ACTION1, further suggesting it's an interactive element that can be moved or change its position.\n  - Top UI element: Color 14 (light pink) Horizontal rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker)\n      Evidence: This element is located outside the main play area. Its orientation and position change dramatically and frequently even when the player's primary action has no effect on the play area, indicating it reflects broader game state or turn changes, not just successful moves.\n  - Magenta UI element: Color 13 (magenta) Irregular shape (2x2 square) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic UI indicator / state marker)\n      Evidence: This element is located outside the main play area. It disappears and reappears with game actions (e.g., disappears after ACTION2), indicating it is part of the game's UI and tracks some aspect of the game state or progress.\n  - Grey interactive object (State 1): Color 4 (gray) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, potentially a switch or trigger)\n      Evidence: These objects appeared upon successful player movement (ACTION2) and one was observed to change to Color 11, indicating they are interactive and have a state transformation.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What is the exact role and function of each of the distinct border colors (aqua, blue, green, yellow, and now pink)? Do they all act as hard boundaries, or do some have unique interactions (e.g., scoring zones, teleporters)?\n  - What is the precise pattern of color changes for the 'Player/Movable Block' (Color 8)? Is it a sequence, or are there different player types/states with distinct colors? Can it be multiple colors at once, or does it change state based on interaction?\n  - What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? While some respond to successful moves, the Color 14 UI element changing significantly even when ACTION1 failed, suggests it reflects a broader game state change (e.g., a turn being taken, even if unproductive).\n  - Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?\n  - What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION1 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction for the supposed target object.\n  - What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?\n  - What is the significance of the appearance of a Color 11 block (4x4) at (48,28) and the disappearance of the Color 11 block (4x4) at (28,28)? Is this movement, 'collection', or a state change triggered by ACTION1?\n  - Do all player movements occur in 4-unit increments, or does it vary by action/direction?\n  - What is the role of the orange block (Color 2)?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (16, 40): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8) (UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (new): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 13 irregular shape (64x7) at (0, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x56) at (7, 0): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8) at (40, 28): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8) at (44, 44): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12) at (8, 32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Object at (28, 36): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Player movement occurs in 4-unit increments for upward movement as well.\n  - The UI elements continue to be highly dynamic, with the 'Color 14' element shifting from a vertical bar on the right side to a horizontal bar at the top, and a new Color 11 element appearing.\n  - ACTION5 is confirmed to be a 'no-op' when the player (Color 11 block) is not interacting with anything, demonstrating its behavior when no valid 'interaction' or 'selection' target is present.\n  - The player block is still identified as 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4)' after previous observation.\n  - The 'Color 8 rectangular block (4x4)' is still present at (36, 12) but is not acting as the player block in this instance.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 2 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION5: 2 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."

    "reasoning": "ACTION1 and ACTION5 both recently resulted in 'NO EFFECT'. To effectively re-test ACTION1, we need to change the player's position. ACTION4 is partially verified and is the only movement action with any verification (1/3 consistent), making it the most reliable option for changing positions. Moving right (ACTION4) will move the player block (Color 8) out of its current position adjacent to the green landmass on the left and the blue border, which will provide a new context for testing ACTION1. Specifically, the player (Color 8) is currently at (28,24). Moving right once (ACTION4) will move it to (28,28). This new position places the player block adjacent to the target of ACTION1, 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' (which it moved towards for its last effective run), therefore it is a good position to determine if the effect on the UI changes if the object is closer to the intended target.",
    "expected_information_gain": "By moving the player (Color 8) to a new position using ACTION4 and then attempting ACTION1, we expect to gain insight into: 1) whether the 'NO EFFECT' for ACTION1 was context-dependent (i.e., due to the previous position), 2) to get another observation for ACTION4's consistency towards its verification, and 3) whether ACTION1's interaction with UI elements and Color 11 / Color 4 objects is dependent on proximity or relative position. This will contribute to reaching 3/3 consistent observations for ACTION1 or ACTION4, and further refine our understanding of their definitions.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 8) is located at (28,24). To its left is a green landmass (Color 3) and the blue border. To its right is open red-brown space (Color 6). There is an orange block (Color 2) at (48,12) and a grey block (Color 4) at (48,32) and the 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)'. The last two attempts of ACTION1 were 'NO EFFECT' in the primary play area, but did cause UI changes. To properly test ACTION1, the player block (Color 8) needs to be in a different position to avoid repeating the same 'NO EFFECT' scenario. ACTION4 is chosen as the setup since it is the most verified movement action."
