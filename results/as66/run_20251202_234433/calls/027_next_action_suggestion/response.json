  "reasoning": "ACTION1 and ACTION5 both recently resulted in 'NO EFFECT'. To effectively re-test ACTION1, we need to change the player's position. ACTION4 is partially verified and is the only movement action with any verification (1/3 consistent), making it the most reliable option for changing positions. Moving right (ACTION4) will move the player block (Color 8) out of its current position adjacent to the green landmass on the left and the blue border, which will provide a new context for testing ACTION1. Specifically, the player (Color 8) is currently at (28,24). Moving right once (ACTION4) will move it to (28,28). This new position places the player block adjacent to the target of ACTION1, 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)' (which it moved towards for its last effective run), therefore it is a good position to determine if the effect on the UI changes if the object is closer to the intended target.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the player (Color 8) to a new position using ACTION4 and then attempting ACTION1, we expect to gain insight into: 1) whether the 'NO EFFECT' for ACTION1 was context-dependent (i.e., due to the previous position), 2) to get another observation for ACTION4's consistency towards its verification, and 3) whether ACTION1's interaction with UI elements and Color 11 / Color 4 objects is dependent on proximity or relative position. This will contribute to reaching 3/3 consistent observations for ACTION1 or ACTION4, and further refine our understanding of their definitions.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player block (Color 8) is located at (28,24). To its left is a green landmass (Color 3) and the blue border. To its right is open red-brown space (Color 6). There is an orange block (Color 2) at (48,12) and a grey block (Color 4) at (48,32) and the 'Color 11 rectangular block (4x4) at (48, 28)'. The last two attempts of ACTION1 were 'NO EFFECT' in the primary play area, but did cause UI changes. To properly test ACTION1, the player block (Color 8) needs to be in a different position to avoid repeating the same 'NO EFFECT' scenario. ACTION4 is chosen as the setup since it is the most verified movement action."
