    "Refined understanding of UI elements: The appearance of the Color 14 (light pink) rectangular block as a 4x48 block at (8,4) and the disappearance of a 48x4 block at (56,8) indicates the UI elements are dynamic and possibly shift or reconfigure, suggesting a complex UI state rather than simple counters. The previous label 'bottom UI element' for the Color 14 block was likely incorrect given its current position as a vertical bar, now re-identified as a 'Left UI element'.",
    "Correction in Player Block Color: The player block, confirmed to move, is currently Color 8. Previous understanding stated Color 14 changing to Color 12 after movement. This discrepancy suggests the player block can have multiple states or colors, or that previous color identification for the player was incorrect. More observations are needed to clarify the player block's color states.",
