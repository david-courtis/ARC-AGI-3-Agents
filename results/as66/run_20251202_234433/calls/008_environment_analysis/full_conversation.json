BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

During this move\nEvidence Status: STATE CHANGE OBSERVED - Use this as evidence!\n\nRECENT CHANGES OBSERVED (THIS IS EVIDENCE!):\nTotal: 428 pixels changed. Regions affected: lower_left_playarea (192), upper_left_playarea (112), lower_right_playarea (96), upper_right_playarea (16), top_ui (12) Changes in both play area and UI elements. Change bounding box: rows [0-59], cols [4-55]\n\nObject-level changes: APPEARED: 1 objects\n  + Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 4)\nDISAPPEARED: 1 objects\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8)\nMOVED: 1 objects\n  ~ Color 8 rectangular block (4x4) at (28, 40) moved left\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING (MAY BE WRONG - UPDATE IF NEEDED):\nBackground: Color 6 (red-brown)\nBorder: Yes (Color 10 (aqua)) - A continuous, single-pixel thick aqua line forming a square perimeter around the play area. Inside this aqua border, there's a blue border on the left and top, and a green border at the bottom. A pink bar is at the bottom, just inside the green border. There's also a yellow border at the very bottom of the screen, outside the main aqua border.\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - The aqua, blue, green, pink, and yellow borders likely prevent movement beyond the visible game screen.\n  - The green 'landmass' blocks appear to be static obstacles, likely blocking movement through them.\n  - The black 'player' block changes color (color 14 to 12) upon moving, implying a state change associated with movement.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (red-brown) Large rectangular area (Role: The main play area, where other objects are located.)\n  - Player/Movable Block: Color 8 (black) U-shaped block (Role: Player-controlled object or a key interactive element.)\n  - Green 'landmass' blocks: Color 3 (green) Irregularly shaped blocks (Role: Obstacles or static environment features.)\n  - Orange block: Color 2 (orange) Small square block (Role: Collectible or a target.)\n  - Top UI element (appeared): Color 13 (magenta) Small rectangular block (13x1) (Role: UI element, possibly a move counter or status indicator.)\n  - Bottom UI element (appeared): Color 14 (light pink) Long rectangular block (48x4) (Role: Base for the UI area or a status bar.)\nSpatial structure: A square play area enclosed by multiple borders. Contains irregularly placed static 'landmass' blocks and a movable player block. There seems to be a distinct UI area above the main play area.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Identified clear UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks) that reliably appear or change with actions, separate from the main play area. This suggests an independent UI layer.\n- Confirmed the 'player' block changes color (from 14 to 12) upon successful movement, suggesting a 'charged' or 'active' state indicated by color.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What is the exact role of the multiple colored borders (aqua, blue, green, pink, yellow)? Are they all hard boundaries or do some have unique interactions?\n- What triggers the appearance or disappearance of the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? Are they move counters, scores, or turn indicators?\n- Are the green 'landmass' blocks truly static, or can they be interacted with or moved under certain conditions?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 seems to be an action that attempts to modify the game state, likely by moving an active object. In this instance, it had no visible effect. It's possible there is no active object specified, or a constraint prevented movement. This contradicts the semantic hint that ACTION1 means 'Move UP'.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 attempts to move a specific object (likely the player block) down. If successful, the player block moves down and changes its color (e.g., from 14 to 12). Simultaneously, UI elements appear/change in the top area (Color 13 rectangular block at (0, 25) and Color 14 rectangular block at (56, 8)). The appearance of these UI elements acts as a reliable indicator of a successful action that affects game state.\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 moves the presumed player object (Color 8 rectangular block) one unit to the left in each animation frame until it moves a total of 4 units, or until it hits an obstacle/border. This action also triggers changes in the UI elements: specific Color 14 UI elements disappear and new ones appear.\"\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
