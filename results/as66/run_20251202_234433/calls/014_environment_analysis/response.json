Is it a sequence, or are there different player types/states with distinct colors? Can it be multiple colors at once, or does it change state based on interaction?",
    "What triggers the changes in the UI elements (Color 13 and Color 14 blocks)? Are they move counters, scores, turn indicators, or progress bars, and how do their sizes/positions relate to game state? The fact they didn't change with 'no effect' means they track *successful* changes to game state.",
    "Can the green 'landmass' blocks ever be removed, altered, or interacted with, or are they permanent static obstacles?",
    "What specific movement direction(s) does ACTION5 attempt? The failure implies blockage in that direction. What would cause ACTION5 to have no effect on the current player block (Color 8)?",
    "What is the exact content/pixel pattern of the Player/Movable Block (Color 8)? Is it always a 'U' shape, or does it change?"
