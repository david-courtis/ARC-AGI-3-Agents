1. Confirmed that 'no effect' actions provide strong evidence for movement constraints. ACTION5 having no effect suggests the player (Color 8 block) was blocked from moving by either the border or an internal obstacle in all directions attempted by ACTION5.
2. Refined understanding of player block color (Color 8 and previously Color 14 and Color 12). The Player/Movable Block is currently Color 8 (black) and was the target of the ineffective ACTION5. This reinforces its role as the active element and that it can have multiple colors, or that previous color identifications were for a different state/block, or simply an observational error that is now corrected.
