  "reasoning": "Both ACTION1 and ACTION5 had no effect in their previous attempts. According to the critical rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before re-testing a no-effect action. ACTION3 (Move Left) has demonstrated movement of the movable block and would change its position, creating a new state. The movable block is currently near the dynamic right border. Moving left with ACTION3 would shift it away from the right border and towards the center or left, potentially clearing any implicit blockage that might have caused ACTION1 or ACTION5 to have no effect. Since ACTION1 has only been attempted once and its definition is still very vague, it takes priority over ACTION5 for re-testing after ensuring a state change.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving left with ACTION3, we expect to a) confirm the movement of the black block and b) confirm the dynamic border shift. Then, by testing ACTION1 in this new position, we hope to observe a concrete effect of ACTION1, or at least gain more insight into why it has no effect in certain contexts. We want to understand what 'def' it refers to. Moving the block might also change its interaction with the green 'landmasses' or other environment elements.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable 4x4 black block is currently at a position (visible in the image at approximately 32, 40 based on recent history) where it is to the right of the central green 'landmass' and to the left of the dynamic right Color 14 border and the pink static side element (8,0). ACTION1 and ACTION5 previously had no visible effect. We need to introduce a change in the block's position to properly re-test these actions. ACTION3 is a verified movement that will shift the block left by 2 units and change the dynamic side borders."
