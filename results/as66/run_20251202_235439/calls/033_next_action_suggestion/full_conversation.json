It also dynamically alters a border element: if a dynamic side border (Color 14, 4x48) was present, it disappears, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) appears at (4,8). If the movable block is blocked (e.g., by another object or the top of the play area), it will not move.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 transforms the player-controlled block from a 4x4 block into a C-shaped block (Color 8) and places it at (48,12). It also causes a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0) to disappear, causes an orange irregular shape (20x12) to move from (8,32) to (10,30), and two new orange irregular shapes to appear at (40,28) and (44,44). Additionally, it changes the color of the outermost top-left border area from Color 13 to Color 11.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the movable block 2 units to the left. Causes the dynamic Color 14 block previously on the right side to disappear and a new dynamic Color 14 block (4x48) to appear on the left side, shifting the horizontal play area. Also causes the disappearance of the 'changing block' at (4,8).\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action also causes the dynamic left-side Color 14 block to disappear and a new dynamic right-side Color 14 block to appear.\n  ACTION5: VERIFIED - ACTION5 attempts to move the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action is blocked if a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present.\n\nRECENT ACTION HISTORY (last 10 actions taken):\n  1.

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink, magenta))\n  Description: The outermost boundary is a single pixel thick: Color 3 (green) on top, left, and right, and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside the green top, left, and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with Color 10 (light blue) outermost and Color 14 (dark blue) inner. At the bottom, inside the green border, there's a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and below that a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). A 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar is at the very left edge (8,0). Dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) blocks appear and disappear on the left, right, and top sides, changing the horizontal and vertical confines of the play area. A magenta (Color 5) single pixel line is on the very top, acting as a UI element. The outermost top-left border area changed from color 13 to color 11 due to ACTION2.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides. A dynamic top boundary can also appear. The outermost top-left border area changed color, indicating a potentially dynamic UI or border element within the outermost frame.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.\n  - Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.\n  - Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.\n  - Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.\n  - ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).\n  - Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.\n  - Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.\n  - Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.\n  - Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.\n  - The movable block (player) changed shape from a 4x4 block to a C-shaped block (Color 8) and appeared at a new position (48,12) as a result of ACTION2.\n  - ACTION2 caused the disappearance of a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0), suggesting it was a consumable or temporary obstacle/element.\n  - The outermost top-left border area, previously light pink (Color 13), changed to a different color (Color 11) with ACTION2. This indicates dynamic behavior even in the outermost border/UI elements, possibly a feedback mechanism.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - Movement is confined within the bounds defined by the static inner Color 14 border and the dynamically appearing Color 14 side blocks.\n  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner static Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be blocked by the existing dynamic right boundary, or the green 'landmass' next to it.)\n  - The movable black block can move upwards (as seen with ACTION1).\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5 by the existing dynamic right boundary.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role: Static obstacles or terrain elements)\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area where game actions occur)\n      Evidence: Entities move within this area; forms the canvas for gameplay.\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role hypothesis: Static obstacles or terrain elements that block movement or define pathways)\n      Evidence: They are stationary and appear to occupy space within the play area, potentially impeding free movement.\n  - Movable Block (Player Form 1): Color 8 (black) C-shaped block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)\n      Evidence: Its position changed with ACTION2, and its previous form (4x4 block) was explicitly moved by other actions. The disappearance of the 4x4 block and appearance of this C-shape block by ACTION2 suggests a transformation or 'respawn' into this new form.\n  - Orange collectible/target (Type 1): Color 4 (orange) Irregular shape (20x12) (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Moved position slightly with ACTION2. Its original form disappeared and new forms appeared with ACTION2, suggesting it's an interactive element.\n  - Orange collectible/target (Type 2): Color 4 (orange) Irregular shape (12x8) (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Appeared with ACTION2, suggesting it's newly generated or interactable.\n  - Orange collectible/target (Type 3): Color 4 (orange) Irregular shape (8x8) (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Appeared with ACTION2, suggesting it's newly generated or interactable.\n  - Outer Top/Left/Right Border: Color 3 (green) Thin lines forming the outermost boundary (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary of the game world, restricting movement beyond them.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present at the edges, no objects have ever moved beyond it. It forms the outermost shell of the play area.\n  - Outer Bottom Border: Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Outermost bottom boundary of the game world, definitively ending the play area downwards.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present at the very bottom, no objects observed moving below it.\n  - Light Blue Border Layer: Color 10 (light blue) Thin lines, inner to the green border, outer to the dark blue border (Role hypothesis: Mid-layer of the play area border, further defining the playable space.)\n      Evidence: Acts as an intermediate boundary, visually segmenting the border from the play area.\n  - Inner Dark Blue Border Layer (Static): Color 14 (dark blue) Thin lines, inner to the light blue border (Role hypothesis: Inner layer of the primary play area border, forming a static enclosure within the larger dynamic boundaries.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present as an inner border, although some sections are dynamic. This static part defines the core limits.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or critical boundary at the bottom of the play area, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Persistent horizontal bar at the bottom, indicating a solid floor or impassable boundary. No objects have been observed moving through it.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Persistent horizontal bar below the pink bar, reinforcing the presence of an impassable floor.\n  - Persistent Left Static Element: Color 13 (light pink) 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall bar (Role hypothesis: A static, fixed boundary or visual marker on the far left.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present at (8,0) across multiple actions, suggesting a static boundary or visual reference point. It is distinct from the dynamic side borders.\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears on either the left or right side, limiting the horizontal movement of the movable block.)\n      Evidence: Observed appearing and disappearing with different actions (ACTION3, ACTION4), and blocking movement (ACTION5). This confirms its dynamic nature and role in defining the horizontal play space.\n  - UI element/Score indicator: Color 5 (magenta) Single pixel line on the very top (Role hypothesis: UI Element, possibility of a move counter or score)\n      Evidence: Located outside the main play area at the top, consistent placement for UI. Its static nature suggests it could be a persistent indicator.\n  - Dynamic Top Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears at the top, limiting vertical movement.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (4,8) with ACTION1, indicating it can dynamically constrain the top of the play area.\n  - Grey block: Color 12 (grey) rectangular block (1x31) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic obstacle or a consumed element.)\n      Evidence: Disappeared as a result of ACTION2, suggesting it might be an interactive element that can be removed.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What triggers the appearance/disappearance of the dynamic boundaries? Is it specific to movement direction, position, or an internal game state?\n  - What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n  - What happens when the movable block interacts with the orange collectible?\n  - What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n  - Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n  - Is the appearance of a dynamic top boundary tied to specific vertical movement or reaching a specific vertical coordinate?\n  - What is the exact mechanism causing the outermost top-left border area to change color (Color 13 to Color 11) and what does this color change signify?\n  - What is the significance of the grey block (Color 12) disappearing as a consequence of ACTION2?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 8 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Right Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4 at (56,8)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Dynamic Top Border (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (16x16): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x31): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (64x32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - Orange irregular shapes (Color 4) are now identified as dynamic elements that can both disappear and appear, and also move, in response to ACTION2. They might represent 'targets' or 'collectible' elements.\n  - The gray rectangular block (Color 12) at (32,0) also disappeared, indicating it's a dynamic element affected by ACTION2.\n  - The outermost top-left border area (initially Color 13) changes to Color 11, indicating a state change in UI or overall game status.\n  - The semantic hint REMAINS IMPORTANT, but the 'move down' aspect might be a result of the 'respawn' or 'transformation' of the block to a lower position, rather than a direct incremental movement. The 'four units' part of the previous definition is inconsistent with the large jump observed here.\n  - The earlier observation of a color change of the block at (4,8) from color 14 to color 12 and the appearance of a dynamic Color 14 block (48x4) at (56,8) needs to be re-evaluated. It seems ACTION2 can have highly varied effects depending on the environment, ranging from simple movement to global state changes and object transformations/respawns. The previous interpretation of 'dynamic side boundary' appearing was based on the block at (56,8), but this observation shows a more complex interaction. The specific changes seen in previous observations might just be *one type* of outcome of ACTION2, rather than its universal definition.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION5\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 2 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION5: 3 recent no-effect attempts\n\nAVOID EXPECTED NO-OPS: If you believe an action will cause a no-op in the current state (based on your understanding of the environment), please choose a different action or use a setup sequence to change position first.\nActions with recent no-ops:\n  ACTION5: 4 consecutive no-effects (last reason: The movable black block was at (28,24). The semantic hint for ACTION5 is 'INTERA...)\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
