  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has only been tested once and needs more validation. ACTION5 is now verified to move the movable block right when not blocked, and can be used to set up the next test. The current movable block needs to move away from the green obstacle and the border if we are to test further right movement. Using a verified ACTION5 will move the current C-shaped player to a new position. After moving the player, we will test ACTION4.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validate the definition of ACTION4 and discover if there are any new dynamic boundary appearances or other effects when moving the non-4x4-black-block player right. Specifically, we want to see if the dynamic boundary logic (left disappears, right appears) still holds for the C-shaped block.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The C-shaped black block is currently at (48,12) near a green 'landmass' and close to the left border. This position is not ideal for testing rightward movement (ACTION4) immediately, as it is blocked by the green 'landmass'. We need to move it to a more open position to properly test ACTION4."
