  "interpretation": "The 4x4 black block at (28, 40) moved two units up to (26, 40). Simultaneously, the previous dynamic Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56) (which was on the right side) disappeared, and a new Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) (on the top side as a border). This new block is shorter than dynamic side borders, matching the dimensions of previously observed bottom borders. Given its position, this is likely a dynamic top border.",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION1 moves the movable 4x4 black block two units upwards if unobstructed. It also dynamically alters a border element. If a dynamic side border (Color 14, 4x48) is present (after rightward/leftward movement), it will disappear, and a dynamic top border (Color 14, 48x4) will appear. If the movable block is blocked (e.g., by another object or the top of the play area), it will not move.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": false,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable black block was at (28, 40) and had no obstacles directly two units above it, allowing it to move up. The presence of the dynamic Color 14 block on the right side (at (8,56)) facilitated its disappearance and the appearance of the new dynamic Color 14 block at the top as a dynamic border. This suggests a pattern where up/down actions also influence top/bottom dynamic borders, similar to horizontal actions influencing side borders.",
