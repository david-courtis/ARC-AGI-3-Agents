1. ACTION3 had no effect on the Movable Block (Player) at (24,24), despite previous observations of it moving left with ACTION3. This indicates a new positional or environmental constraint blocking leftward movement at this specific location, even if no visible obstacle appears to be directly in the way.
2. ACTION3 caused the disappearance of a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4) at (4,8) and the appearance of a Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48) at (8,4). This confirms the linked nature of dynamic boundary shifts even when the main player block does not move with ACTION3.
3. ACTION3 caused the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) to move left and the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to move right, demonstrating that these objects can respond to ACTION3 even when the player block is blocked. This reveals their independent nature and their varied responses to the same action.
