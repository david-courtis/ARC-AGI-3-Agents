ACTION3: ACTION3 attempts to move the movable block two units to the left. If the movable block is NOT obstructed, it moves two units to the left, (causes the dynamic top border to disappear and a new dynamic left border to appear, and moves the 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' to the left by two units). If the player block IS obstructed, it does NOT move, but it still triggers the disappearance of the Dynamic Top Boundary and the appearance of the Dynamic Side Boundary (Left). It also causes the 'Moving Irregular Block' to move left and the 'Moving Rectangular Block' to move right. The movable block does not change its appearance.
  Reason: This action observation shows ACTION3 having no effect on the player block, but still causing the dynamic boundaries to shift and the other two independent blocks to move in their respective directions. This refines the understanding of ACTION3's conditional effects.
