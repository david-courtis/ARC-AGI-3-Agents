  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 5/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 attempts to move the movable block two units upwards. If the movable block is obstructed, it does NOT move; instead, other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block move two units to the LEFT. This obstructed scenario also causes specific dynamic boundary changes, including the disappearance of a dynamic left boundary (Color 14) and the appearance of a dynamic top boundary (Color 14). If not obstructed, it moves the movable block two units upwards, causing a dynamic right boundary (Color 14) to disappear and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to appear. This action does not appear to change the movable block's color or shape.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 attempts to move the movable block two units down. If successful, it causes the dynamic side border on the right (if present) to disappear and a dynamic bottom border (48x4, Color 14, at (56,8)) to appear. If a dynamic bottom border is already present, this action might behave differently (e.g., in previous instances the movable block was transformed and other objects disappeared or moved, or a new dynamic top border appeared). There are cases where this action causes the movable block to transform (e.g. into a C-shaped block) and re-spawn at a new location while changing other obstacles.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the movable block two units to the right. It causes the dynamic Color 14 block on the right side to disappear and a new dynamic Color 14 block (4x48) to appear on the left side, shifting the horizontal play area. The movable block also changes its appearance to a Color 11 rectangular block if it was previously in another form (e.g., C-shaped).\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block two units to the right. It causes the existing dynamic top border (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) to disappear, and a new dynamic right border (Color 14, 4x48 at (8,56)) to appear. Other independent elements (Color 12 irregular shapes and Color 13 rectangular blocks) also move two units to the right. This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.\n  ACTION5: VERIFIED - ACTION5 attempts to move the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action is blocked if a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink, magenta))\n  Description: The outermost boundary is a single pixel thick: Color 3 (green) on top, left, and right, and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. A magenta (Color 5) single pixel line is on the very top, acting as a UI element. Inside the green top, left, and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with Color 10 (light blue) outermost and Color 14 (dark blue) inner. At the bottom, inside the green border, there's a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and below that a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). A 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar is at the very left edge (8,0). Dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) blocks appear and disappear on the left, right, and top sides, changing the horizontal and vertical confines of the play area.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides. A dynamic top boundary can also appear. The outermost top-left border area changed color (Color 13 to Color 11), indicating a potentially dynamic UI or feedback element within the outermost frame. New UI elements appear on the left outside the main play area.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.\n  - Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.\n  - Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.\n  - Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.\n  - ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).\n  - Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.\n  - Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.\n  - Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.\n  - Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.\n  - The movable block (player) changed shape from a 4x4 block to a C-shaped block (Color 8) and appeared at a new position (48,12) as a result of ACTION2.\n  - ACTION2 caused the disappearance of a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0), suggesting it was a consumable or temporary obstacle/element.\n  - The outermost top-left border area, previously light pink (Color 13), changed to a different color (Color 11) with ACTION2. This indicates dynamic behavior even in the outermost border/UI elements, possibly a feedback mechanism.\n  - The movable player block, previously identified as black, is now described as Color 11, and the current state shows a Color 8 black C-shaped block. This indicates the player block can change color and shape based on actions. This observation resolves a discrepancy from a previous analysis's description of ACTION4 (which stated Color 11 for the player block that moved left), and this current frame shows a black (Color 8) player block.\n  - Explicit identification of new UI elements appearing: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40). These are outside the main play area, suggesting they are UI or game state indicators, possibly related to moves or progress.\n  - The movable block moved left by four units as a result of ACTION4, providing more specific movement distance for this action.\n  - The movable block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28,28) to (28,30).\n  - Discrepancy resolved: The player block's previous description of 'Color 11' from ACTION4 analysis was likely a temporary state or error; its current observable state and previous ACTION2 state is Color 8 C-shaped, and this action's effect confirms a Color 11 rectangular block. This suggests the player block can change both shape and color depending on the action or state.\n  - The movable player block's color changed from 'Color 8 (black)' to 'Color 11 (light gray)' and its shape changed from 'C-shaped' to 'rectangular block (4x4)' as a result of ACTION4. This strongly reinforces the idea that the player entity can dynamically change both its form and color.\n  - ACTION4 caused the previous dynamic right boundary to disappear and a new dynamic left boundary to appear at (8,56). This provides further evidence that the dynamic side boundaries effectively shift the active horizontal play area by appearing and disappearing on opposite sides.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move two units downwards as demonstrated by ACTION2.\n  - The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) was expected to move up with ACTION1, but instead, it did NOT move. This means its movement is blocked by an invisible element or new constraints. This contradicts the previous understanding that ACTION1 always moves the block up.\n  - ACTION1 now has varied outcomes; it can either move the player block up (as in a previous observation) or, if blocked, it can cause other objects to move and trigger dynamic boundary changes. This indicates a conditional action or a more complex game state interaction for ACTION1.\n  - A previously identified Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) DISAPPEARED in this action.\n  - A Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) APPEARED in this action. This further solidifies the concept of dynamic boundaries controlling the available play space.\n  - Two new movable objects were confirmed: a Color 12 irregular shape (12x12) and a Color 13 (light pink) rectangular block (4x4), both of which moved right in this action. These are distinct interactive elements within the game world.\n  - Identified a new object: a Cyan block (Color 14) positioned to the upper left of the playing area, obscuring part of the Red background. This is a newly seen object or part of an existing dynamic structure.\n  - Refined understanding of the movable block's properties: The movable block (player) is a Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, moving two units to the right as a result of ACTION4. This clarifies previous ambiguous color/shape descriptions and confirms its current form upon successful ACTION4 execution.\n  - The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) at (24,24) did NOT move up with ACTION1. This confirms that ACTION1's effect of moving the player block up is conditional and can be blocked.\n  - ACTION1, when blocked for the main player, now explicitly triggers the movement of the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) AND the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to the left by two units. This confirms these other objects are interactable and their movement is tied to the main player's failed ACTION1.\n  - This instance of ACTION1 also caused a Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) to DISAPPEAR, and a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) to APPEAR. This further reinforces the complex, conditional nature of ACTION1 and the dynamic environment elements.\n  - The Color 14 Cyan block newly identified in the upper left (previously 'Cyan Block (Upper Left)' in object_identified) is now part of the Dynamic Top Boundary (48x4 at (4,8)) that appeared. It is not a separate object but rather part of the dynamic boundary system.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - Movement is confined within the bounds defined by the static inner Color 14 border and the dynamically appearing Color 14 side blocks.\n  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner static Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be blocked by the existing dynamic right boundary, or the green 'landmass' next to it.)\n  - The movable black block can move upwards (as seen with ACTION1).\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5 by the existing dynamic right boundary.\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3 and ACTION4).\n  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4 and current ACTION3 observation).\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5.\n  - The movable black block can move left by up to four units (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - The movable block can move right by two units (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - The movable block can move left by four units (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - The movable block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - The movable block can move left (as seen with ACTION3 and ACTION4).\n  - The movable block can move right (as seen with ACTION4 and ACTION3 observation).\n  - The movable block is blocked from moving right by a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48).\n  - The movable block can move upwards (as seen with ACTION1).\n  - The movable block can move left by up to four units (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - The movable block can move right by two units (as seen with ACTION3 the current ACTION4 observation).\n  - The movable block can move right (as seen with ACTION4 and current ACTION3 observation).\n  - The movable block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5 by a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48).\n  - The movable block can move upwards (as seen with ACTION1 in previous observations).\n  - The movable block's upward movement (ACTION1) can be blocked by an unknown element/constraint, causing other objects to move and different boundary changes to occur.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role: Static obstacles or terrain elements)\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area where game actions occur)\n      Evidence: It is the largest contiguous area behind other objects and where movement is observed.\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role hypothesis: Static obstacles or terrain elements that block movement or define pathways)\n      Evidence: They remain stationary across actions and seem to occupy space that other objects cannot move into.\n  - Movable Block (Player): Color 11 (light gray) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)\n      Evidence: It is the primary object that moves in response to actions and dynamically changes shape and/or color.\n  - Outer Top/Left/Right Border: Color 3 (green) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Outermost fixed boundary of the game world)\n      Evidence: Consistently present as the outermost green layer.\n  - Outer Bottom Border: Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Outermost fixed bottom boundary of the game world)\n      Evidence: Consistently present as the outermost yellow layer at the bottom.\n  - Light Blue Border Layer: Color 10 (light blue) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Mid-layer of the play area border, further defining the playable space)\n      Evidence: Located inside the green border, consistently present.\n  - Inner Dark Blue Border Layer (Static): Color 14 (dark blue) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Inner layer of the primary play area border, forming a static enclosure within the larger dynamic boundaries.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present inside the light blue border, defining a primary static play area. Differentiated from dynamic dark blue blocks by its persistent presence.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or critical boundary at the bottom of the play area, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Consistent horizontal bar at the bottom, below the main play area.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Consistent horizontal bar at the very bottom, below the pink bar.\n  - Persistent Left Static Element: Color 13 (light pink) 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall bar (Role hypothesis: A static, fixed boundary or visual marker on the far left.)\n      Evidence: Remains in place across multiple actions and is part of the fixed border structure.\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Right): Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears on the right side, limiting the horizontal movement of the movable block.)\n      Evidence: Appears and disappears, and has been observed to block rightward movement.\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Left): Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears on the left side, limiting the horizontal movement of the movable block.)\n      Evidence: Appears and disappears, shifting the horizontal play area.\n  - UI element/Score indicator: Color 5 (magenta) Single pixel line on the very top (Role hypothesis: UI Element, possibility of a move counter or score)\n      Evidence: Located at the very top, outside the main play area, showing properties of a UI element.\n  - Dynamic Top Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears at the top, limiting vertical movement.)\n      Evidence: Observed appearing at the top in response to actions.\n  - UI Element (Left, Pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular block (16x1) (Role hypothesis: UI or game state indicator)\n      Evidence: Appeared outside the main play area on the left, indicating a UI role.\n  - UI Element (Left, Grey): Color 12 Irregular shape (24x63) (Role hypothesis: UI or game state indicator)\n      Evidence: Appeared outside the main play area on the left, indicating a UI role.\n  - Moving Irregular Block: Color 12 Irregular shape (12x12) (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, possibly a collectible or switch)\n      Evidence: Observed moving in response to ACTION1, but not the primary player block.

Its exact role is yet to be determined but it covers a significant area.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What triggers the appearance/disappearance of the dynamic boundaries? Is it specific to movement direction, position, or an internal game state?\n  - What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n  - What happens when the movable block interacts with the green 'landmass'?\n  - What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n  - Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n  - Is the appearance of a dynamic top boundary tied to specific vertical movement or reaching a specific vertical coordinate?\n  - What is the exact mechanism causing the outermost top-left border area to change color (Color 13 to Color 11) and what does this color change signify?\n  - What is the significance of the grey block (Color 12) disappearing as a consequence of ACTION2?\n  - What is the role of the newly appeared Color 13 and Color 12 UI elements (from ACTION4)? Are they move counters, score, or something else?\n  - What specific static or dynamic element blocked the movable player block from moving up with ACTION1 this time?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 8 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Right Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4 at (56,8)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Dynamic Top Border (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (16x16): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x31): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (64x32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (dynamic left border): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (dynamic right border): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 11 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8, 56)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8, 4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Movable Block (Player, Current Form): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary: Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Bottom Border: Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Movable Block (Player): Color 11 (light gray) Rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares: Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Left): Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Dynamic Top Border: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 12 irregular shape (12x12): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (4x4) at (12,24): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Moving Irregular Block: Color 12 irregular shape (12x12): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Moving Rectangular Block: Color 13 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Top Boundary: Color 14 rectangular block (48x4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Right): Color 14 rectangular block (4x48): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Moving Rectangular Block: Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - ACTION4 causes the dynamic top border to disappear and a dynamic right border to appear (previously recorded as dynamic left/right or right/left side border changes).\n  - Other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) also move two units right when ACTION4 is performed on the primary movable block.\n  - The movable block (Color 11) does not change shape or color as a result of ACTION4 in this instance (contradicting previous analysis).\n  - The 'Moving Irregular Block' with Color 12 irregular shape (12x12) is now observed to move LEFT by two units when ACTION1 is applied and the main movable block is obstructed.

If the movable block is obstructed, it does NOT move; instead, other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block move two units to the LEFT. This obstructed scenario also causes specific dynamic boundary changes, including the disappearance of a dynamic left boundary (Color 14) and the appearance of a dynamic top boundary (Color 14).

The movable block also changes its appearance to a Color 11 rectangular block if it was previously in another form (e.g., C-shaped).\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block two units to the right. It causes the existing dynamic top border (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) to disappear, and a new dynamic right border (Color 14, 4x48 at (8,56)) to appear. Other independent elements (Color 12 irregular shapes and Color 13 rectangular blocks) also move two units to the right. This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.\n  ACTION5: VERIFIED - ACTION5 attempts to move the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action is blocked if a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present.\n\nRECENT ACTION HISTORY (last 10 actions taken):\n  1.

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink, magenta))\n  Description: The outermost boundary is a single pixel thick: Color 3 (green) on top, left, and right, and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. A magenta (Color 5) single pixel line is on the very top, acting as a UI element. Inside the green top, left, and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with Color 10 (light blue) outermost and Color 14 (dark blue) inner. At the bottom, inside the green border, there's a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and below that a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). A 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar is at the very left edge (8,0). Dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) blocks appear and disappear on the left, right, and top sides, changing the horizontal and vertical confines of the play area.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides. A dynamic top boundary can also appear. The outermost top-left border area changed color (Color 13 to Color 11), indicating a potentially dynamic UI or feedback element within the outermost frame. New UI elements appear on the left outside the main play area.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.\n  - Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.\n  - Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.\n  - Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.\n  - ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).\n  - Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.\n  - Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.\n  - Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.\n  - Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.\n  - The movable block (player) changed shape from a 4x4 block to a C-shaped block (Color 8) and appeared at a new position (48,12) as a result of ACTION2.\n  - ACTION2 caused the disappearance of a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0), suggesting it was a consumable or temporary obstacle/element.\n  - The outermost top-left border area, previously light pink (Color 13), changed to a different color (Color 11) with ACTION2. This indicates dynamic behavior even in the outermost border/UI elements, possibly a feedback mechanism.\n  - The movable player block, previously identified as black, is now described as Color 11, and the current state shows a Color 8 black C-shaped block. This indicates the player block can change color and shape based on actions. This observation resolves a discrepancy from a previous analysis's description of ACTION4 (which stated Color 11 for the player block that moved left), and this current frame shows a black (Color 8) player block.\n  - Explicit identification of new UI elements appearing: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40). These are outside the main play area, suggesting they are UI or game state indicators, possibly related to moves or progress.\n  - The movable block moved left by four units as a result of ACTION4, providing more specific movement distance for this action.\n  - The movable block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28,28) to (28,30).\n  - Discrepancy resolved: The player block's previous description of 'Color 11' from ACTION4 analysis was likely a temporary state or error; its current observable state and previous ACTION2 state is Color 8 C-shaped, and this action's effect confirms a Color 11 rectangular block. This suggests the player block can change both shape and color depending on the action or state.\n  - The movable player block's color changed from 'Color 8 (black)' to 'Color 11 (light gray)' and its shape changed from 'C-shaped' to 'rectangular block (4x4)' as a result of ACTION4. This strongly reinforces the idea that the player entity can dynamically change both its form and color.\n  - ACTION4 caused the previous dynamic right boundary to disappear and a new dynamic left boundary to appear at (8,56). This provides further evidence that the dynamic side boundaries effectively shift the active horizontal play area by appearing and disappearing on opposite sides.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move two units downwards as demonstrated by ACTION2.\n  - The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) was expected to move up with ACTION1, but instead, it did NOT move. This means its movement is blocked by an invisible element or new constraints. This contradicts the previous understanding that ACTION1 always moves the block up.\n  - ACTION1 now has varied outcomes; it can either move the player block up (as in a previous observation) or, if blocked, it can cause other objects to move and trigger dynamic boundary changes. This indicates a conditional action or a more complex game state interaction for ACTION1.\n  - A previously identified Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) DISAPPEARED in this action.\n  - A Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) APPEARED in this action. This further solidifies the concept of dynamic boundaries controlling the available play space.\n  - Two new movable objects were confirmed: a Color 12 irregular shape (12x12) and a Color 13 (light pink) rectangular block (4x4), both of which moved right in this action. These are distinct interactive elements within the game world.\n  - Identified a new object: a Cyan block (Color 14) positioned to the upper left of the playing area, obscuring part of the Red background. This is a newly seen object or part of an existing dynamic structure.\n  - Refined understanding of the movable block's properties: The movable block (player) is a Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, moving two units to the right as a result of ACTION4. This clarifies previous ambiguous color/shape descriptions and confirms its current form upon successful ACTION4 execution.\n  - The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) at (24,24) did NOT move up with ACTION1. This confirms that ACTION1's effect of moving the player block up is conditional and can be blocked.\n  - ACTION1, when blocked for the main player, now explicitly triggers the movement of the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) AND the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to the left by two units. This confirms these other objects are interactable and their movement is tied to the main player's failed ACTION1.\n  - This instance of ACTION1 also caused a Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) to DISAPPEAR, and a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) to APPEAR. This further reinforces the complex, conditional nature of ACTION1 and the dynamic environment elements.\n  - The Color 14 Cyan block newly identified in the upper left (previously 'Cyan Block (Upper Left)' in object_identified) is now part of the Dynamic Top Boundary (48x4 at (4,8)) that appeared. It is not a separate object but rather part of the dynamic boundary system.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - Movement is confined within the bounds defined by the static inner Color 14 border and the dynamically appearing Color 14 side blocks.\n  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner static Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5.

Its exact role is yet to be determined but it covers a significant area.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What triggers the appearance/disappearance of the dynamic boundaries?
