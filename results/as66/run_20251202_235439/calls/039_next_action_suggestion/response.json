  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has only 2/3 consistent observations and its definition currently states it moves the movable block four units to the left. The `Recent Observations` section within the ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING also corroborates this with 'ACTION4 causes the movable block to move four units to the left, contradicting the semantic hint and previous observation that it moves right.'. This inconsistency (semantic hint says right, observations say left) needs to be clarified to fully verify the action. The current position of the player block (C-shaped, black) at (28, 28) is good for testing movement to the left as there's ample space. No recent `no effect` attempts make this a suitable immediate test.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Verify the direction and distance of movement for ACTION4. Confirm if it consistently moves the block four units to the left or if the semantic hint of moving right has some context. Also, observe if the dynamic border changes and the UI elements appear consistently as previously described.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The C-shaped black block is currently at (28,28). There is sufficient space to its left to test ACTION4's movement. There are no obvious immediate obstacles that would block a leftward movement, such as a wall or dynamic border on the left side. The existence of the dynamic color 14 right border (from ACTION3) is noted, but should not impede left movement. This state is good for testing ACTION4."
