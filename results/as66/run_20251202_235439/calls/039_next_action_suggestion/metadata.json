  "prompt": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 moves the movable 4x4 black block two units upwards if unobstructed. It also dynamically alters a border element: if a dynamic side border (Color 14, 4x48) was present, it disappears, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) appears at (4,8). If the movable block is blocked (e.g., by another object or the top of the play area), it will not move.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 transforms the player-controlled block from a 4x4 block into a C-shaped block (Color 8) and places it at (48,12). It also causes a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0) to disappear, causes an orange irregular shape (20x12) to move from (8,32) to (10,30), and two new orange irregular shapes to appear at (40,28) and (44,44). Additionally, it changes the color of the outermost top-left border area from Color 13 to Color 11.\n  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 moves the movable block two units to the right. It consistently causes the dynamic Color 14 block on the right side to disappear and a new dynamic Color 14 block (4x48) to appear on the left side, shifting the horizontal play area. The movable block also changes its appearance to a Color 11 rectangular block if it was previously in another form (e.g., C-shaped).\n  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the movable block four units to the left. This action also causes the dynamic left-side Color 14 block to disappear and a new dynamic right-side Color 14 block to appear. Additionally, new UI elements appear: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40).\n  ACTION5: VERIFIED - ACTION5 attempts to move the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action is blocked if a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink, magenta))\n  Description: The outermost boundary is a single pixel thick: Color 3 (green) on top, left, and right, and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside the green top, left, and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with Color 10 (light blue) outermost and Color 14 (dark blue) inner. At the bottom, inside the green border, there's a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and below that a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). A 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar is at the very left edge (8,0). Dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) blocks appear and disappear on the left, right, and top sides, changing the horizontal and vertical confines of the play area. A magenta (Color 5) single pixel line is on the very top, acting as a UI element. The outermost top-left border area changed from Color 13 to Color 11 due to ACTION2.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides. A dynamic top boundary can also appear. The outermost top-left border area changed color, indicating a potentially dynamic UI or border element within the outermost frame.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.\n  - Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.\n  - Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.\n  - Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.\n  - ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).\n  - Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.\n  - Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.\n  - Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.\n  - Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.\n  - The movable block (player) changed shape from a 4x4 block to a C-shaped block (Color 8) and appeared at a new position (48,12) as a result of ACTION2.\n  - ACTION2 caused the disappearance of a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0), suggesting it was a consumable or temporary obstacle/element.\n  - The outermost top-left border area, previously light pink (Color 13), changed to a different color (Color 11) with ACTION2. This indicates dynamic behavior even in the outermost border/UI elements, possibly a feedback mechanism.\n  - The movable player block, previously identified as black, is now described as Color 11, and the current state shows a Color 8 black C-shaped block. This indicates the player block can change color and shape based on actions. This observation resolves a discrepancy from a previous analysis's description of ACTION4 (which stated Color 11 for the player block that moved left), and this current frame shows a black (Color 8) player block.\n  - Explicit identification of new UI elements appearing: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40). These are outside the main play area, suggesting they are UI or game state indicators, possibly related to moves or progress.\n  - The movable block moved left by four units as a result of ACTION4, providing more specific movement distance for this action.\n  - The movable block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28,28) to (28,30).\n  - Discrepancy resolved: The player block's previous description of 'Color 11' from ACTION4 analysis was likely a temporary state or error; its current observable state and previous ACTION2 state is Color 8 C-shaped, and this action's effect confirms a Color 11 rectangular block. This suggests the player block can change both shape and color depending on the action or state.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - Movement is confined within the bounds defined by the static inner Color 14 border and the dynamically appearing Color 14 side blocks.\n  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner static Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be blocked by the existing dynamic right boundary, or the green 'landmass' next to it.)\n  - The movable black block can move upwards (as seen with ACTION1).\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5 by the existing dynamic right boundary.\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3 and ACTION4).\n  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4 and current ACTION3 observation).\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5.\n  - The movable black block can move left by up to four units (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - The movable block can move right by two units (as seen with ACTION3).\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role: Static obstacles or terrain elements)\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area where game actions occur)\n      Evidence: This is the primary color of the largest continuous empty space where movable objects are observed.\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role hypothesis: Static obstacles or terrain elements that block movement or define pathways)\n      Evidence: These shapes are consistently present in the play area and impede movement in certain actions.\n  - Movable Block (Player, Current Form): Color 8 (black) C-shaped block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)\n      Evidence: The object has been observed moving and changing shape/color as a direct result of actions (ACTION2, ACTION3).\n  - Orange collectible/target (Type 1): Color 4 (orange) Irregular shape (20x12) (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Appears to be a distinct object within the play area, likely interacting with the player.\n  - Orange collectible/target (Type 2): Color 4 (orange) Irregular shape (12x8) (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Appears to be a distinct object within the play area, likely interacting with the player.\n  - Orange collectible/target (Type 3): Color 4 (orange) Irregular shape (8x8) (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Appears to be a distinct object within the play area, likely interacting with the player.\n  - Outer Top/Left/Right Border: Color 3 (green) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary of the game world, restricting movement beyond them.)\n      Evidence: Consistently forms the very edge of the observable game environment.\n  - Outer Bottom Border: Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Outermost bottom boundary of the game world, definitively ending the play area downwards.)\n      Evidence: Fixed at the very bottom, forms a hard limit for any downward movement.\n  - Light Blue Border Layer: Color 10 (light blue) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Mid-layer of the play area border, further defining the playable space.)\n      Evidence: Located consistently inside the green border, creating a layered boundary structure.\n  - Inner Dark Blue Border Layer (Static): Color 14 (dark blue) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Inner layer of the primary play area border, forming a static enclosure within the larger dynamic boundaries.)\n      Evidence: Forms an inner frame, distinct from the dynamic Color 14 blocks, defining a persistent playable area.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or critical boundary at the bottom of the play area, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present as a horizontal bar at the bottom of the main play area, inside the outer borders.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Located below the pink bar, forming another layer of the bottom boundary.\n  - Persistent Left Static Element: Color 13 (light pink) 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall bar (Role hypothesis: A static, fixed boundary or visual marker on the far left.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present at (8,0), inside the light blue border, and does not move or disappear with actions.\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears on either the left or right side, limiting the horizontal movement of the movable block.)\n      Evidence: Observed appearing and disappearing on the left and right, and blocking movement (ACTION5).\n  - UI element/Score indicator: Color 5 (magenta) Single pixel line on the very top (Role hypothesis: UI Element, possibility of a move counter or score)\n      Evidence: Positioned at the very top, outside the main play area, suggesting a non-gameplay UI function.\n  - Dynamic Top Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears at the top, limiting vertical movement.)\n      Evidence: Observed appearing at (4,8) with ACTION1, dynamically controlling the top limit of the play area.\n  - Consumed/Temporary Element (Grey block): Color 12 (grey) Rectangular block (1x31) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic obstacle or a consumed element.)\n      Evidence: Observed disappearing as a result of ACTION2, suggesting it's either consumed or a temporary state of another element.\n  - UI Element (Color 13): Color 13 Rectangular block (16x1) (Role hypothesis: UI Element or progress indicator.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (0, 24) as a result of ACTION4, outside the main play area, suggesting it's not a game object but an indicator.\n  - UI Element (Color 12): Color 12 Irregular shape (24x63) (Role hypothesis: UI Element or progress indicator.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (0, 40) as a result of ACTION4, outside the main play area, suggesting it's not a game object but an indicator.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What triggers the appearance/disappearance of the dynamic boundaries? Is it specific to movement direction, position, or an internal game state?\n  - What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n  - What happens when the movable block interacts with the orange collectible?\n  - What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n  - Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n  - Is the appearance of a dynamic top boundary tied to specific vertical movement or reaching a specific vertical coordinate?\n  - What is the exact mechanism causing the outermost top-left border area to change color (Color 13 to Color 11) and what does this color change signify?\n  - What is the significance of the grey block (Color 12) disappearing as a consequence of ACTION2?\n  - What is the role of the newly appeared Color 13 and Color 12 UI elements (from ACTION4)? Are they move counters, score, or something else?\n  - How does the movable block's color and shape change (from black 4x4 to C-shaped black for ACTION2, and Color 11 rectangular block for ACTION3)? This seems to suggest it's not a single block but a 'player entity' that can take different forms.\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 8 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Right Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4 at (56,8)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Dynamic Top Border (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (16x16): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x31): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (64x32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (dynamic left border): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (dynamic right border): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 11 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8, 56)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8, 4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The movable block's color was initially misidentified. It is Color 11 (light gray) and is currently a 4x4 rectangular block, not a C-shaped block (Color 8).\n  - ACTION4 causes the movable block to move four units to the left, contradicting the semantic hint and previous observation that it moves right.\n  - ACTION4 consistently causes the dynamic left border to disappear and a dynamic right border to appear. This is consistent with previous observations about the dynamic borders, but the movement direction is reversed from the previous experience with ACTION4.\n  - ACTION4 also causes new UI elements to appear, specifically a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0,24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0,40). This is a new side effect.\n  - The movable block is identified as Color 11 (light gray) 4x4 rectangular block in this animation. It is not Color 8 C-shaped, nor black, resolving the discrepancy from previous observations. This might imply different forms of the playable character/block.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION5\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nSuggest what action to test next and any setup sequence needed.",

It also dynamically alters a border element: if a dynamic side border (Color 14, 4x48) was present, it disappears, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) appears at (4,8). If the movable block is blocked (e.g., by another object or the top of the play area), it will not move.\n  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 transforms the player-controlled block from a 4x4 block into a C-shaped block (Color 8) and places it at (48,12). It also causes a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0) to disappear, causes an orange irregular shape (20x12) to move from (8,32) to (10,30), and two new orange irregular shapes to appear at (40,28) and (44,44).

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink, magenta))\n  Description: The outermost boundary is a single pixel thick: Color 3 (green) on top, left, and right, and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside the green top, left, and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with Color 10 (light blue) outermost and Color 14 (dark blue) inner. At the bottom, inside the green border, there's a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and below that a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). A 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar is at the very left edge (8,0). Dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) blocks appear and disappear on the left, right, and top sides, changing the horizontal and vertical confines of the play area. A magenta (Color 5) single pixel line is on the very top, acting as a UI element. The outermost top-left border area changed from Color 13 to Color 11 due to ACTION2.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides. A dynamic top boundary can also appear. The outermost top-left border area changed color, indicating a potentially dynamic UI or border element within the outermost frame.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.\n  - Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.\n  - Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.\n  - Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.\n  - ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).\n  - Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.\n  - Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.\n  - Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.\n  - Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.\n  - The movable block (player) changed shape from a 4x4 block to a C-shaped block (Color 8) and appeared at a new position (48,12) as a result of ACTION2.\n  - ACTION2 caused the disappearance of a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0), suggesting it was a consumable or temporary obstacle/element.\n  - The outermost top-left border area, previously light pink (Color 13), changed to a different color (Color 11) with ACTION2. This indicates dynamic behavior even in the outermost border/UI elements, possibly a feedback mechanism.\n  - The movable player block, previously identified as black, is now described as Color 11, and the current state shows a Color 8 black C-shaped block. This indicates the player block can change color and shape based on actions. This observation resolves a discrepancy from a previous analysis's description of ACTION4 (which stated Color 11 for the player block that moved left), and this current frame shows a black (Color 8) player block.\n  - Explicit identification of new UI elements appearing: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40). These are outside the main play area, suggesting they are UI or game state indicators, possibly related to moves or progress.\n  - The movable block moved left by four units as a result of ACTION4, providing more specific movement distance for this action.\n  - The movable block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28,28) to (28,30).\n  - Discrepancy resolved: The player block's previous description of 'Color 11' from ACTION4 analysis was likely a temporary state or error; its current observable state and previous ACTION2 state is Color 8 C-shaped, and this action's effect confirms a Color 11 rectangular block. This suggests the player block can change both shape and color depending on the action or state.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - Movement is confined within the bounds defined by the static inner Color 14 border and the dynamically appearing Color 14 side blocks.\n  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner static Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be blocked by the existing dynamic right boundary, or the green 'landmass' next to it.)\n  - The movable black block can move upwards (as seen with ACTION1).\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5 by the existing dynamic right boundary.\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3 and ACTION4).\n  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4 and current ACTION3 observation).\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5.\n  - The movable black block can move left by up to four units (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - The movable block can move right by two units (as seen with ACTION3).\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role: Static obstacles or terrain elements)\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area where game actions occur)\n      Evidence: This is the primary color of the largest continuous empty space where movable objects are observed.\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role hypothesis: Static obstacles or terrain elements that block movement or define pathways)\n      Evidence: These shapes are consistently present in the play area and impede movement in certain actions.\n  - Movable Block (Player, Current Form): Color 8 (black) C-shaped block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)\n      Evidence: The object has been observed moving and changing shape/color as a direct result of actions (ACTION2, ACTION3).\n  - Orange collectible/target (Type 1): Color 4 (orange) Irregular shape (20x12) (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Appears to be a distinct object within the play area, likely interacting with the player.\n  - Orange collectible/target (Type 2): Color 4 (orange) Irregular shape (12x8) (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Appears to be a distinct object within the play area, likely interacting with the player.\n  - Orange collectible/target (Type 3): Color 4 (orange) Irregular shape (8x8) (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Appears to be a distinct object within the play area, likely interacting with the player.\n  - Outer Top/Left/Right Border: Color 3 (green) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary of the game world, restricting movement beyond them.)\n      Evidence: Consistently forms the very edge of the observable game environment.\n  - Outer Bottom Border: Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Outermost bottom boundary of the game world, definitively ending the play area downwards.)\n      Evidence: Fixed at the very bottom, forms a hard limit for any downward movement.\n  - Light Blue Border Layer: Color 10 (light blue) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Mid-layer of the play area border, further defining the playable space.)\n      Evidence: Located consistently inside the green border, creating a layered boundary structure.\n  - Inner Dark Blue Border Layer (Static): Color 14 (dark blue) Thin lines (Role hypothesis: Inner layer of the primary play area border, forming a static enclosure within the larger dynamic boundaries.)\n      Evidence: Forms an inner frame, distinct from the dynamic Color 14 blocks, defining a persistent playable area.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or critical boundary at the bottom of the play area, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present as a horizontal bar at the bottom of the main play area, inside the outer borders.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Located below the pink bar, forming another layer of the bottom boundary.\n  - Persistent Left Static Element: Color 13 (light pink) 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall bar (Role hypothesis: A static, fixed boundary or visual marker on the far left.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present at (8,0), inside the light blue border, and does not move or disappear with actions.\n  -

UI element/Score indicator: Color 5 (magenta) Single pixel line on the very top (Role hypothesis: UI Element, possibility of a move counter or score)\n      Evidence: Positioned at the very top, outside the main play area, suggesting a non-gameplay UI function.\n  - Dynamic Top Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears at the top, limiting vertical movement.)\n      Evidence: Observed appearing at (4,8) with ACTION1, dynamically controlling the top limit of the play area.\n  - Consumed/Temporary Element (Grey block): Color 12 (grey) Rectangular block (1x31) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic obstacle or a consumed element.)\n      Evidence: Observed disappearing as a result of ACTION2, suggesting it's either consumed or a temporary state of another element.\n  - UI Element (Color 13): Color 13 Rectangular block (16x1) (Role hypothesis: UI Element or progress indicator.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (0, 24) as a result of ACTION4, outside the main play area, suggesting it's not a game object but an indicator.\n  - UI Element (Color 12): Color 12 Irregular shape (24x63) (Role hypothesis: UI Element or progress indicator.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (0, 40) as a result of ACTION4, outside the main play area, suggesting it's not a game object but an indicator.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What triggers the appearance/disappearance of the dynamic boundaries? Is it specific to movement direction, position, or an internal game state?\n  - What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n  - What happens when the movable block interacts with the orange collectible?\n  - What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n  - Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n  - Is the appearance of a dynamic top boundary tied to specific vertical movement or reaching a specific vertical coordinate?\n  - What is the exact mechanism causing the outermost top-left border area to change color (Color 13 to Color 11) and what does this color change signify?\n  - What is the significance of the grey block (Color 12) disappearing as a consequence of ACTION2?\n  - What is the role of the newly appeared Color 13 and Color 12 UI elements (from ACTION4)? Are they move counters, score, or something else?\n  - How does the movable block's color and shape change (from black 4x4 to C-shaped black for ACTION2, and Color 11 rectangular block for ACTION3)? This seems to suggest it's not a single block but a 'player entity' that can take different forms.\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 8 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Right Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4 at (56,8)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Dynamic Top Border (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (16x16): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 12 rectangular block (1x31): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (20x12): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (12x8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 irregular shape (8x8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (64x32): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 11 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (dynamic left border): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) (dynamic right border): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) (UI element): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 11 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8, 56)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8, 4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The movable block's color was initially misidentified. It is Color 11 (light gray) and is currently a 4x4 rectangular block, not a C-shaped block (Color 8).\n  - ACTION4 causes the movable block to move four units to the left, contradicting the semantic hint and previous observation that it moves right.\n  - ACTION4 consistently causes the dynamic left border to disappear and a dynamic right border to appear. This is consistent with previous observations about the dynamic borders, but the movement direction is reversed from the previous experience with ACTION4.\n  - ACTION4 also causes new UI elements to appear, specifically a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0,24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0,40). This is a new side effect.\n  - The movable block is identified as Color 11 (light gray) 4x4 rectangular block in this animation. It is not Color 8 C-shaped, nor black, resolving the discrepancy from previous observations. This might imply different forms of the playable character/block.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): ACTION5\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 2 recent no-effect attempts; ACTION5: 3 recent no-effect attempts\n\nAVOID EXPECTED NO-OPS: If you believe an action will cause a no-op in the current state (based on your understanding of the environment), please choose a different action or use a setup sequence to change position first.\nActions with recent no-ops:\n  ACTION5: 4 consecutive no-effects (last reason: The movable black block was at (28,24).

Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."

    "reasoning": "ACTION4 has only 2/3 consistent observations and its definition currently states it moves the movable block four units to the left. The `Recent Observations` section within the ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING also corroborates this with 'ACTION4 causes the movable block to move four units to the left, contradicting the semantic hint and previous observation that it moves right.'. This inconsistency (semantic hint says right, observations say left) needs to be clarified to fully verify the action. The current position of the player block (C-shaped, black) at (28, 28) is good for testing movement to the left as there's ample space. No recent `no effect` attempts make this a suitable immediate test.",
    "expected_information_gain": "Verify the direction and distance of movement for ACTION4. Confirm if it consistently moves the block four units to the left or if the semantic hint of moving right has some context. Also, observe if the dynamic border changes and the UI elements appear consistently as previously described.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The C-shaped black block is currently at (28,28). There is sufficient space to its left to test ACTION4's movement. There are no obvious immediate obstacles that would block a leftward movement, such as a wall or dynamic border on the left side. The existence of the dynamic color 14 right border (from ACTION3) is noted, but should not impede left movement. This state is good for testing ACTION4."
