  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has only 2/8 attempts and 0/3 consistent observations. It's a high priority for further testing. The movable block is currently in a different shape (C-shaped) than when ACTION2 was previously observed to change it to a C-shape, which is an interesting state to re-test it in, to observe if it can change form multiple times, revert shapes, or has other effects in this context. The observations from ACTION2 also describe a sequence of object disappearances and appearances which are not fully understood.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the effect of ACTION2 on the movable block (currently C-shaped) to see if it changes its form again or if the action behaves differently given the block's current state. We also want to observe if the various other object disappearances and appearances (grey block, orange shapes, border color change) are consistent, which will help us move towards verifying this action.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable block is currently a C-shaped black block at (28,24). There is a dynamic left boundary at (8,56) and no dynamic right boundary. ACTION5, which is verified, caused no effect due to being blocked, but we're not testing ACTION5 right now. This current state is suitable for testing ACTION2."
