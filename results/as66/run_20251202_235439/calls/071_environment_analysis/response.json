In both cases (successful or obstructed movement of player), the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) both move two units to the right. Additionally, ACTION4 causes the existing dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) to disappear, and a new dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) to appear. Conversely, if a dynamic left boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present, it will disappear, and a new dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) will appear. This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.",
      "reasoning": "Previous observations indicated ACTION4 always moved the player block right. This observation shows it can be blocked, making its movement conditional. The movement of the other two 'Moving' blocks and the dynamic boundary changes still occur even if the player block is blocked."
