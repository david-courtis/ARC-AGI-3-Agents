  "interpretation": "The movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, previously at (36,24), moved two units up to (34,24). The Color 12 irregular shape (12x12) that was at (8,20) moved two units left to (8,18). The Color 13 rectangular block (4x4) that was at (12,20) moved two units left to (12,18). A dynamic bottom boundary (Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8)) disappeared, and a new dynamic top boundary (Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4,8)) appeared. Notably, the movable block moved up, which contradicts the previous 'obstructed' scenario where the movable block did not move.",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION1 attempts to move the movable block two units upwards. If the movable block is NOT obstructed, it moves two units upwards, and causes a dynamic bottom boundary (Color 14) to disappear and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to appear. If the movable block IS obstructed, it does NOT move; instead, other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block move two units in a horizontal direction (either left or right) and causes a dynamic left boundary (Color 14) to disappear and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to appear. This action does not appear to change the movable block's color or shape.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block was at (36,24). Unlike previous observations where it was blocked, in this context, there was no direct physical obstruction of green 'landmass' or other elements immediately two units above it, allowing it to move upward. The presence of the dynamic bottom border (Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8)) enabled its disappearance, and the new dynamic top border (Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4,8)) appeared. The other movable elements (Moving Irregular Block and Moving Rectangular Block) were present at (8,20) and (12,20) respectively, and moved along with the main block, in this case, two units to the left.",
