  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been VERIFIED and needs more validation. It also caused the movable block to change shape to a Color 11 rectangular block and moved it, providing valuable insights into player dynamics and environmental responses. It last moved the block to a new position, thus is less likely to result in a no-effect. Other actions like ACTION5 have been recently observed to have no effect; ACTION1 had no effect quite recently and if it caused the special case of boundary changes before, we should try a movement action that changes the player's position first before retesting this behavior. ACTION2 caused the block to change shape, but the latest observation of ACTION4 was a movement without a shape change, making it a good candidate to re-test the movement aspect and dynamic boundary changes. ACTION3 shifted boundaries similar to ACTION4 but in the opposite direction. Since ACTION4 moves the block to the left, which is a new position compared to the last ACTION1 no-move event, it's a good choice for continued exploration.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To observe the movement dynamics of ACTION4 and how it interacts with the dynamic boundaries and other objects in the current configuration. Specifically, to verify if it removes the dynamic left boundary and creates a dynamic right boundary, and if the movable block changes shape/color again. To understand if the block moves by 2 or 4 units consistently.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board features the C-shaped (Color 8) movable block. There's a dynamic top border (Color 14) at (4,8), and a dynamic right border (Color 14). The cyan block (Color 14) is still present. The presence of the dynamic top border may influence vertical movement actions, and dynamic right border may influence rightward movement. Moving left with ACTION4 will move the block out of its current position, potentially allowing for varied interactions with the environment and new boundary dynamics."
