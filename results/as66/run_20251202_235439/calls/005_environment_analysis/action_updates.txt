ACTION2: ACTION2 moves the 4x4 color 8 block four units down, causes a color change of the block at (4,8) from color 14 to color 12, and triggers the appearance of new elements, including a 13x1 color 13 block at (0,25) and a 48x4 color 14 block at (56,8) which appears to be a dynamic right border. It also causes the appearance of a 13x1 Color 13 block at (0,25).
  Reason: The previous definition partially covered the effects. This update clarifies the specific color change and makes a strong hypothesis about the dynamic nature of the Color 14 block as an appearing border element, correcting the understanding that it was a static element. It also includes the previously missed small appearing color 13 block.
