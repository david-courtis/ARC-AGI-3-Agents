  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has inconsistencies in its definition and has not been verified. Specifically, the definitions for ACTION1 and ACTION4 both mention moving the 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' to the RIGHT when the player block is obstructed, which is contradictory. This current state, with the player block at (24,32) and no immediate visible obstacles to the right, provides a good opportunity to test ACTION4's movement and its effect on the secondary blocks, especially since ACTION3 was unsuccessful at the player's last known position (24,24). The player block's current position (24,32) means it's not at the same spot where ACTION4 was blocked in the previous turn, thus avoiding an expected no-op. ACTION2 and ACTION3 are also pending but ACTION4 needs urgent clarification due to the contradictory descriptions with ACTION1 and its secondary object movement.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to clarify the movement behavior of the movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block with ACTION4, especially if it's not obstructed. Crucially, we aim to consistently observe the behavior of the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) when ACTION4 is performed, as current knowledge of their movement is contradictory across action definitions. We also want to observe if a dynamic boundary changes and if ACTION4 consistently causes the existing dynamic top boundary to disappear and a new right boundary to appear.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable block (Player) is at (24,32). There is a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4) at (4,8). The 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) are present. ACTION1 recently failed to move the player and caused the secondary objects to move LEFT. There are no immediate visible obstacles to the right of the player block, making this a good state to test rightward movement."
