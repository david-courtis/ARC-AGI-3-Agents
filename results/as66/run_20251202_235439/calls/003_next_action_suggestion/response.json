  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION1 recently had no effect, so we must try a different action. ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5 have not been observed yet. We prioritize actions with zero observations. Since there are no verified actions to use in a setup sequence, and ACTION1 had no effect in the current state, we should test a new action that might change the state. ACTION2 is chosen as the next unobserved action to test.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We hope to observe the effect of ACTION2, potentially learning about movement or another game mechanic.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is unknown. There are no obstacles blocking movement as far as we can tell. There are no objects to interact with specifically, but the overall environment appears to be a red background with some green and an orange pixel, and some black pixels at the bottom center. There are also blue and light blue borders."
