Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 7/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 attempts to move the movable block two units upwards. If successful, it moves two units upwards, causes a dynamic bottom boundary (Color 14) to DISAPPEAR, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to APPEAR. This action also causes other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block to move two units to the LEFT. If the movable block IS obstructed from moving upwards, it does NOT move; instead, other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) move two units to the RIGHT. Additionally, if blocked, a dynamic side boundary (Right) DISAPPEARS and a dynamic top boundary APPEARS. The movable block's color and shape are not changed by this action.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 4/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the primary movable block two units down. If successful, it causes the dynamic top border (if present) to disappear and a new dynamic right border (Color 14, 4x48, at (56,8)) to appear. It also moves the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to the left by two units.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 3/8 attempts | Def: ACTION3 attempts to move the movable block two units to the left. If the movable block is NOT obstructed, it moves two units to the left, (causes the dynamic top border to disappear and a new dynamic left border to appear, and moves the 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' to the left by two units). If the player block IS obstructed, it does NOT move, but it still triggers the disappearance of the Dynamic Top Boundary and the appearance of the Dynamic Side Boundary (Left). It also causes the 'Moving Irregular Block' to move left and the 'Moving Rectangular Block' to move right. The movable block does not change its appearance.
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 6/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 attempts to move the movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block two units to the right. If successful, it moves two units to the right. If it is obstructed (e.g., by an appearing dynamic right boundary), the movable block does not move. In both cases (successful or obstructed movement of player), the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) both move two units to the right. Additionally, ACTION4 causes the existing dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) to disappear, and a new dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) to appear. Conversely, if a dynamic left boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present, it will disappear, and a new dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) will appear. This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.
  ACTION5: VERIFIED - ACTION5 attempts to move the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action is blocked if a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present.

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)

BORDER: Yes (Multiple (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink, magenta))
  Description: The outermost boundary is a single pixel thick: Color 3 (green) on top, left, and right, and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. A magenta (Color 5) single pixel line is on the very top, acting as a UI element. Inside the green top, left, and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with Color 10 (light blue) outermost and Color 14 (dark blue) inner. At the bottom, inside the green border, there's a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and below that a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). A 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar is at the very left edge (8,0). Dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) blocks appear and disappear on the left, right, and top sides, changing the horizontal and vertical confines of the play area.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides. A dynamic top boundary can also appear. New UI elements appear on the left outside the main play area.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.
  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.
  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).
  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.
  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.
  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).
  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).
  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.
  - Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.
  - Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.
  - Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.
  - Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.
  - ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.
  - Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).
  - Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.
  - Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.
  - Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.
  - Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.
  - The movable block (player) changed shape from a 4x4 block to a C-shaped block (Color 8) and appeared at a new position (48,12) as a result of ACTION2.
  - ACTION2 caused the disappearance of a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0), suggesting it was a consumable or temporary obstacle/element.
  - The outermost top-left border area, previously light pink (Color 13), changed to a different color (Color 11) with ACTION2. This indicates dynamic behavior even in the outermost border/UI elements, possibly a feedback mechanism.
  - The movable player block, previously identified as black, is now described as Color 11, and the current state shows a Color 8 black C-shaped block. This indicates the player block can change color and shape based on actions. This observation resolves a discrepancy from a previous analysis's description of ACTION4 (which stated Color 11 for the player block that moved left), and this current frame shows a black (Color 8) player block.
  - Explicit identification of new UI elements appearing: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40). These are outside the main play area, suggesting they are UI or game state indicators, possibly related to moves or progress.
  - The movable block moved left by four units as a result of ACTION4, providing more specific movement distance for this action.
  - The movable block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28,28) to (28,30).
  - Discrepancy resolved: The player block's previous description of 'Color 11' from ACTION4 analysis was likely a temporary state or error; its current observable state and previous ACTION2 state is Color 8 C-shaped, and this action's effect confirms a Color 11 rectangular block. This suggests the player block can change both shape and color depending on the action or state.
  - The movable player block's color changed from 'Color 8 (black)' to 'Color 11 (light gray)' and its shape changed from 'C-shaped' to 'rectangular block (4x4)' as a result of ACTION4. This strongly reinforces the idea that the player entity can dynamically change both its form and color.
  - ACTION4 caused the previous dynamic right boundary to disappear and a new dynamic left boundary to appear at (8,56). This provides further evidence that the dynamic side boundaries effectively shift the active horizontal play area by appearing and disappearing on opposite sides.
  - Confirmed the movable block can move two units downwards as demonstrated by ACTION2.
  - The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) was expected to move up with ACTION1, but instead, it did NOT move. This means its movement is blocked by an invisible element or new constraints. This contradicts the previous understanding that ACTION1 always moves the block up.
  - ACTION1 now has varied outcomes; it can either move the player block up (as in a previous observation) or, if blocked, it can cause other objects to move and trigger dynamic boundary changes. This indicates a conditional action or a more complex game state interaction for ACTION1.
  - A previously identified Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) DISAPPEARED in this action.
  - A Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) APPEARED in this action. This further solidifies the concept of dynamic boundaries controlling the available play space.
  - Two new movable objects were confirmed: a Color 12 irregular shape (12x12) and a Color 13 (light pink) rectangular block (4x4), both of which moved right in this action. These are distinct interactive elements within the game world.
  - Identified a new object: a Cyan block (Color 14) positioned to the upper left of the playing area, obscuring part of the Red background. This is a newly seen object or part of an existing dynamic structure.
  - Refined understanding of the movable block's properties: The movable block (player) is a Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, moving two units to the right as a result of ACTION4. This clarifies previous ambiguous color/shape descriptions and confirms its current form upon successful ACTION4 execution.
  - The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) at (24,24) did NOT move up with ACTION1. This confirms that ACTION1's effect of moving the player block up is conditional and can be blocked.
  - ACTION1, when blocked for the main player, now explicitly triggers the movement of the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) AND the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to the left by two units. This confirms these other objects are interactable and their movement is tied to the main player's failed ACTION1.
  - This instance of ACTION1 also caused a Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) to DISAPPEAR, and a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) to APPEAR. This further reinforces the complex, conditional nature of ACTION1 and the dynamic environment elements.
  - The Color 14 Cyan block newly identified in the upper left (previously 'Cyan Block (Upper Left)' in object_identified) is now part of the Dynamic Top Boundary (48x4 at (4,8)) that appeared. It is not a separate object but rather part of the dynamic boundary system.
  - Confirmed current state of the Movable Block (Player) as Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, moving two units down as a direct result of ACTION2.
  - ACTION2 causes the disappearance of a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) and the appearance of a Dynamic Side Boundary (Right, Color 14, 4x48 at (56,8)). This reinforces the idea that dynamic boundaries are intrinsically linked to actions and can shift across the entire play area, not just move left/right or top/bottom in isolation for an action, but convert between types (top to right).
  - ACTION1 moves the movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block two units upwards.
  - ACTION1 causes the Dynamic Side Boundary (Right, Color 14, 4x48) to DISAPPEAR.
  - ACTION1 causes a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4) to APPEAR at (4,8).
  - ACTION1 causes the Moving Irregular Block (Color 12) and Moving Rectangular Block (Color 13) to move left by an unknown amount (implied by previous observation of movement to the left and this action moving them left).
  - ACTION3 had no effect on the Movable Block (Player) at (24,24), despite previous observations of it moving left with ACTION3. This indicates a new positional or environmental constraint blocking leftward movement at this specific location, even if no visible obstacle appears to be directly in the way.
  - ACTION3 caused the disappearance of a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4) at (4,8) and the appearance of a Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48) at (8,4). This confirms the linked nature of dynamic boundary shifts even when the main player block does not move with ACTION3.
  - ACTION3 caused the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) to move left and the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to move right, demonstrating that these objects can respond to ACTION3 even when the player block is blocked. This reveals their independent nature and their varied responses to the same action.
  - Confirmed the movable block can move two units to the right as observed by ACTION4.
  - Confirmed that ACTION4 causes the current dynamic left boundary to disappear (4x48 at (8,4)) and a new dynamic right boundary to appear (4x48 at (8,56)).
  - Confirmed that both the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) move right in response to ACTION4 when the player also moves right. This reinforces their independent but interactive nature.
  - ACTION4 explicitly moved the Movable Block (Player) two units to the right from (24,24) to (24,26).
  - Confirmed that when ACTION1 does NOT move the Movable Block (Player), it causes a Dynamic Side Boundary (Right, Color 14, 4x48) to DISAPPEAR, and a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4) to APPEAR. This strengthens the understanding of conditional action outcomes and interconnected environment dynamics.
  - Confirmed that when the Movable Block (Player) does NOT move after ACTION1, the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) AND the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) both move to the RIGHT. This is a new, conditional movement pattern for these secondary objects, as previous similar scenarios showed them moving left with a blocked ACTION1. This implies their movement direction with a blocked ACTION1 depends on which dynamic boundary is currently present.
  - The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) at (24,32) did NOT move with ACTION4, confirming that ACTION4's movement is conditional and can be blocked. This is a new constraint for ACTION4.
  - The appearance of the Dynamic Side Boundary (Right, Color 14, 4x48) at (8,56) in conjunction with the player block's inability to move right after ACTION4 strongly suggests that this dynamic boundary is the direct cause of the blockage, rather than an internal obstacle. This clarifies a previous 'unconfirmed hypothesis' regarding ACTION5's blockage, and extends it to ACTION4.

  - The movable block (Player) is currently at (24,24) and ACTION3 had no effect, indicating its movement to the left was blocked in this specific instance. This implies a new or temporary constraint at this position.
  - The movable block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).
  - The movable block can move right (as seen with ACTION4).
  - The movable block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5 by the existing dynamic right boundary.

  - The movable block's upward movement (ACTION1) can be blocked by an unknown element/constraint, causing other objects to move and different boundary changes to occur. This is evidenced by the current observation where the player block did not move.
  - The movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block did NOT move with ACTION4, indicating it is now blocked from moving right due to an unseen constraint or collision with the appearing dynamic right boundary. The dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) appeared at (8,56), which is right of the player block, confirming it is an obstacle.

      Evidence: Moves in response to actions, even when the player block is blocked. Moved right in this action.
  - Moving Rectangular Block: Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular block (4x4) (Role hypothesis: Interactive element, possibly a collectible or switch, independent from player movement but affected by actions)

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION4 consistently causes the existing dynamic left border (Color 14, 4x48) to disappear and a dynamic right border (Color 14, 4x48) to appear.
  - The green 'landmass' (Color 4: 8x12 shape at (20,20)) can act as an obstruction to the Movable Block (Player)'s upward movement.
  - When ACTION1 is blocked from moving the main movable block, it can cause other movable objects ('Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block') to move right, and a dynamic right border to disappear while a dynamic top border appears. The direction of movement for these other objects depends on which dynamic side boundary is present.
  - ACTION4 can be blocked by obstacles, preventing the main movable block from moving.
  - When ACTION4 is blocked for the main movable block, the 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' still move two units to the right.
