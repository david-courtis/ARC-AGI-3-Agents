BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

The outermost border appears to be a single row/column of Color 3 (green) at the top/left/right and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside this, on the top, left and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with the outermost layer being Color 10 (light blue) and the inner layer being Color 14 (dark blue). At the bottom, there are distinct Color 13 (light pink) and Color 3 (green) bars. The left side has a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) from (8,0). The right side has a dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) block (48x4). The top border also has a magenta (Color 5) single pixel line that appears to be a UI element.\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\nIdentified objects:\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role: The main play area where game actions occur)\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role: Static obstacles or terrain elements)\n  - Movable Block: Color 8 (black) 4x4 rectangular block (Role: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)\n  - Orange collectible/target: Color 4 (orange) Single square block (Role: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n  - UI element/Score indicator (magenta): Color 5 (magenta) Small rectangular bar (4x1) on the top border (Role: UI Element, possibly a move counter or score)\n  - Outer Top/Left/Right Border: Color 3 (green) Thin lines forming the outermost boundary (Role: Outermost boundary of the game world)\n  - Outer Bottom Border: Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role: Outermost bottom boundary of the game world)\n  - Light Blue Border Layer: Color 10 (light blue) Thin lines, inner to the green border, outer to the dark blue border (Role: Mid-layer of the play area border)\n  - Dark Blue Border Layer: Color 14 (dark blue) Thin lines, inner to the light blue border (Role: Inner layer of the primary play area border)\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role: Definite floor or critical boundary at the bottom of the play area)\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar)\n  - Changing Block: Color 12 (grey) Single square block (Role: Interactive element whose state changes)\n  - Dynamic Left Side Block: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role: Dynamic boundary or an effect of the action, potentially restricting movement to the left)\n  - Dynamic Right Side Block (Disappeared): Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role: Dynamic boundary or an effect of the action, restricting movement to the right)\nSpatial structure: Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n- Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n- Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n- Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n- Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n- Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n- Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n- Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What triggers the color change of the block at (4,8) (now absent)? Was it specific to position or type of movement?\n- What is the exact role of the appearing dynamic Color 14 side blocks? Are they always exclusionary boundaries or can the player interact with them?\n- What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n- What happens when the movable block interacts with the green 'landmasses' or the orange collectible?\n- What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n- Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 seems to be an action that does not always have a visible effect. Further observations are required to determine its specific function or target.\"\n  ACTION2: \"Moves the 4x4 color 8 block four units down, causes a color change of the block at (4,8) from color 14 to color 12, and triggers the appearance of a dynamic Color 14 block (48x4) at (56,8) which appears to be a dynamic right border. The small 13x1 color 13 block at (0,25) was likely a misinterpretation of the appearance of the dynamic side boundary.\"\n  ACTION3: \"Moves the movable block 2 units to the left. Causes the dynamic Color 14 block previously on the right side to disappear and a new dynamic Color 14 block (4x48) to appear on the left side, shifting the horizontal play area. Also causes the disappearance of the 'changing block' at (4,8).\"\n  ACTION4: \"ACTION4 moves the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action also causes the dynamic left-side Color 14 block to disappear and a new dynamic right-side Color 14 block to appear.\"\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3.
