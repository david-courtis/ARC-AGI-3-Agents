ACTION5: ACTION5 attempts to move the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action is blocked if the movable block's path is obstructed by a dynamic right-side boundary (Color 14) or other obstacles.
  Reason: Observed that ACTION5 had no effect due to the presence of the dynamic right-side boundary, confirming it attempts rightward movement and is blockable.
