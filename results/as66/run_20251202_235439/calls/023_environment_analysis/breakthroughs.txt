1. Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.
2. Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.
