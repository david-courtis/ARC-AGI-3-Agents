  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has consistently produced 'no effect' in previous attempts. The current understanding is that it is blocked by the dynamic right boundary (Color 14). To properly validate ACTION5 and gather more consistent observations, we need to move the movable block away from this boundary. ACTION3 (move LEFT) is verified to move the block and also changes the dynamic side boundaries, which should clear the obstruction for ACTION5. Taking ACTION3 twice will move the block further away from the current right boundary, placing it in a new location.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By executing ACTION5 after moving the movable block to a new position (presumably away from the right boundary), we aim to: 1. See if ACTION5 now produces an effect (e.g., moves the block right) when not obstructed. 2. If it still produces no effect, we can rule out the right boundary as the sole cause of blockage and investigate other potential obstacles or conditions for ACTION5. 3. Further validate the behavior of ACTION3 as a reliable movement action and its interaction with dynamic boundaries.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable black block is currently at (30,40). There is a dynamic right boundary (Color 14) that has consistently blocked ACTION5. The block is also above a green 'landmass'. To test ACTION5 effectively, we need to change its position, primarily to alleviate the right-side obstruction. ACTION3 (move LEFT) is a suitable movement action as it changes both the block's position and the dynamic boundaries, providing a fresh context for ACTION5."
