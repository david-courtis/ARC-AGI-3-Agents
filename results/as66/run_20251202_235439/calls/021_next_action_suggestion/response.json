  "reasoning": "ACTION5 had no effect in its last attempt. Therefore, according to the critical rules, we must move to a new position before re-testing it. None of the actions are verified, but ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 have shown consistent movement over multiple observations. We want to move the movable block away from any potential collision with the bottom boundary and to a new horizontal position to see if ACTION5 has a different effect, especially if it's context-dependent on proximity to other objects or boundaries. Moving down with ACTION2 twice and then right with ACTION4 will place the block in a new, more central location, potentially away from previous blocking elements. ACTION2 has moved the 4x4 block consistently downwards, and ACTION4 has moved it right. This sequence aims to vary both the vertical and horizontal positions significantly. After moving, we will re-test ACTION5 to see if it now has an effect, hopefully revealing its true function.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By moving the movable block to a new position and re-testing ACTION5, we expect to either: 1. See ACTION5 have an effect, which would help us define its function, or 2. Confirm that ACTION5 has no effect in this new context, reinforcing the idea it might be blocked by a general environmental constraint or is a null action unless a very specific condition is met. This will help us decouple the 'no effect' observation from potential environmental blocking in the previous attempt.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable black block is currently at a position where previous attempts of ACTION1 and ACTION5 resulted in 'no effect' or were blocked. It is currently at (26,40) based on latest ACTION1 effect, above a green 'landmass'. The orange collectible is visible in the upper right quadrant of the play area. The boundaries are dynamic, but the current position is not optimal for re-testing a previously 'no-effect' action like ACTION5."
