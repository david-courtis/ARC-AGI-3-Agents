  "target_action": "ACTION1",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "All actions (ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4) are still unverified and have inconsistent observations, so we need to test them further. ACTION1 is a good candidate for exploring further because recent observations have shown it can either move the block up or trigger complex side effects if blocked. The current position is not obviously blocked for upward movement, so it's a good state to test ACTION1.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get closer to verifying ACTION1 by observing its effect. Specifically, to see if the movable block moves up, or if its movement is blocked and triggers other effects. We want to understand the conditions under which ACTION1 moves the block versus when it triggers the secondary effects and dynamic boundary changes.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable block is currently (28,30). There is no obvious obstacle immediately above it in the current image that would prevent upward movement. The current board does not indicate any immediate reason for ACTION1 to fail, based on visual inspection. This makes it a good state to test ACTION1's primary effect (upward movement). There is a dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) and a dynamic left boundary (Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)), which have been observed to disappear with ACTION1."
