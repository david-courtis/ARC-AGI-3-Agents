A Color 13 rectangular block (4x4) that was at (12,16) moved two units right to (12,18).

  "new_definition": "ACTION3 moves the movable block two units to the left. When the movable block is not able to move, it triggers the 'Moving Irregular Block' to move two units to the left, and the 'Moving Rectangular Block' to move two units to the right. It causes the dynamic top border to disappear and a new dynamic left border to appear. The movable block does not change its appearance.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block was at (24,24). The previous semantic hint for ACTION3 is to 'Move LEFT'. Based on a previous observation where ACTION3 moved the player block RIGHT instead of left, and no visible obstacle to its left, it is possible the player block was 'blocked' by an invisible constraint from moving left. This 'blocked' state resulted in other movable objects (Moving Irregular Block and Moving Rectangular Block) moving instead, and a dynamic border transformation from top to left.",
