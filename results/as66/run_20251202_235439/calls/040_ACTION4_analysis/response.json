This action also causes the dynamic left-side Color 14 block to disappear and a new dynamic right-side Color 14 block to appear.

The dynamic Color 14 left border was present, enabling its disappearance and the corresponding appearance of the dynamic right border. The previous instances of 4 units left movement was incorrect due to a misidentification of the moving block, and the 2 units right movement was due to an error in understanding the action or context.",
