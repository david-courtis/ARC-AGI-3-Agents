  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 has only 2/8 attempts logged and zero consistent observations, placing it among the least validated actions. The current player block is at (36,28), and a dynamic left boundary (Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) is present, and there is a dynamic top boundary present at (4,8). Testing ACTION3 will confirm its behavior with these specific boundary conditions and contribute to its verification. Other actions either have more attempts or are currently blocked (ACTION5).",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe if ACTION3 still moves the movable block right by two units, and what dynamic boundary changes occur (disappearance of left boundary and appearance of right boundary as seen previously, or a completely new behavior). It will also confirm if the other moving blocks (Color 12 and Color 13) move left, as described in 'ACTION3's definition from previous observations.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable block is currently positioned at (36,28). There is a dynamic left boundary (Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)). There are no immediate obstacles to the right of the movable block, making it a good state to test rightward movement."
