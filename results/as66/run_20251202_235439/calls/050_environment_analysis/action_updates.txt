ACTION4: ACTION4 moves the movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block two units to the right. It causes the existing dynamic top border (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) to disappear, and a new dynamic right border (Color 14, 4x48 at (8,56)) to appear. Other independent elements (Color 12 irregular shapes and Color 13 rectangular blocks) also move two units to the right. This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.
  Reason: The action explicitly caused the movable block to move right by two units, confirming its movement for this specific action and its current color/shape. It also confirmed the specific dynamic boundary changes, including the disappearance of the top boundary and the appearance of the right boundary, and the movement of other interactive elements.
