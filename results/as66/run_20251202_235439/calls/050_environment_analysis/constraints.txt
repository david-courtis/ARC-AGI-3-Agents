- The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).
- Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).
- The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).
- Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.
- Movement is confined within the bounds defined by the static inner Color 14 border and the dynamically appearing Color 14 side blocks.
- The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4).
- Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner static Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.
- The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5 by the existing dynamic right boundary.
- The movable black block can move upwards (as seen with ACTION1).
- The movable block can move left by up to four units (as seen with ACTION4).
- The movable block can move right by two units (as seen with ACTION3 the current ACTION4 observation).
- The movable block is blocked from moving right by a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48).
- The movable block can move left (as seen with ACTION3 and ACTION4).
- The movable block can move right (as seen with ACTION4 and current ACTION3 observation).
