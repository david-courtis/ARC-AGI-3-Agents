ACTION1: ACTION1 moves the movable 4x4 black block two units upwards if unobstructed. It also dynamically alters a border element: if a dynamic side border (Color 14, 4x48) was present, it disappears, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) appears at (4,8). If the movable block is blocked (e.g., by another object or the top of the play area), it will not move.
  Reason: The current observation explicitly showed ACTION1 moving the black block up by two units and causing the disappearance of a dynamic side boundary (at (8,56)) and the appearance of a dynamic top boundary (at (4,8)). This directly refutes the previous notion that ACTION1 had no visible effect on the game piece itself.
