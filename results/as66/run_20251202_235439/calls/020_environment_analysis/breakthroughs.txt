1. Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).
2. Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.
3. Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.
