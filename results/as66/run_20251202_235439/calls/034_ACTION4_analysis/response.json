This action also causes the dynamic left-side Color 14 block to disappear and a new dynamic right-side Color 14 block to appear. New UI elements also appear related to a Color 13 rectangular block and Color 12 irregular shape.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": false,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable block (Color 11) was positioned at (28,44) which allowed for an unobstructed four-unit movement to the left. The dynamic Color 14 block was present on the left side, allowing its disappearance, which consistently leads to the appearance of a new dynamic Color 14 block on the right side. The UI elements' appearance is an observed side-effect of this action.",

  "context_description": "The game state contained a movable 4x4 block at (28,44) and a dynamic Color 14 boundary on the left side of the play area (8,4). No obstacles blocked the block's movement to the left. The movable block was identified as Color 11 (light gray), not black (Color 8) as previously assumed, and also not a C-shape.",

    "ACTION4 causes the movable block to move four units to the left, contradicting the semantic hint and previous observation that it moves right.",
    "ACTION4 consistently causes the dynamic left border to disappear and a dynamic right border to appear. This is consistent with previous observations about the dynamic borders, but the movement direction is reversed from the previous experience with ACTION4.",
    "ACTION4 also causes new UI elements to appear, specifically a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0,24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0,40). This is a new side effect."
