The dynamic Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) that was at (8, 56) disappeared (right border), and a new Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (56,8), which is a dynamic bottom border.",

  "new_definition": "ACTION2 attempts to move the movable block two units down. If successful, it causes the dynamic side border on the right (if present) to disappear and a dynamic bottom border (48x4, Color 14, at (56,8)) to appear. If a dynamic bottom border is already present, this action might behave differently (e.g., in previous instances the movable block was transformed and other objects disappeared or moved, or a new dynamic top border appeared). There are cases where this action causes the movable block to transform (e.g. into a C-shaped block) and re-spawn at a new location while changing other obstacles.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": false,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable block was at a position (28, 28) where it could move two units down without obstruction. The dynamic right border was present, enabling its disappearance and the corresponding appearance of a dynamic bottom border instead of other dynamic elements, potentially because it implies a 'descent' to a lower platform. The presence of the dynamic Color 14 block at (8, 56) facilitated its disappearance, and the new Color 14 bottom border appeared. The specific distance of 2 units (instead of 4 as observed previously for some cases) suggests either variable movement distance for ACTION2, or that the previous analysis was incorrect in determining the full extent of the movement from a single frame diff, and animation confirms 2 units.",
