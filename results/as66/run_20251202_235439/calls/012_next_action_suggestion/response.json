  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has no observations yet, making it the highest priority for testing. The current state is suitable for testing an interaction/selection action as the movable block is in the center of the play area and not against a wall or other specific obstacle, allowing for a general test.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the basic effect of ACTION5. Does it interact with the movable block itself? Does it interact with a nearby object (if any)? Does it change the game state in a different way (e.g., UI)?",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable block is located centrally within the dynamic boundaries. There are green 'landmasses' and an orange block visible in the play area. This general position is good for an initial test of ACTION5 without specific context dependencies."
