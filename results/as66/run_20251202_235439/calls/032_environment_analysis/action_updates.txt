ACTION2: ACTION2 transforms the player-controlled block from a 4x4 block into a C-shaped block (Color 8) and places it at (48,12). It also causes a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0) to disappear, causes an orange irregular shape (20x12) to move from (8,32) to (10,30), and two new orange irregular shapes to appear at (40,28) and (44,44). Additionally, it changes the color of the outermost top-left border area from Color 13 to Color 11.
  Reason: The previous definition states the movable block 'respawns' or 'changes its form' which is broadly correct, but the specific change from 4x4 to C-shaped block, the precise new position, the disappearance of the grey block, the movement of one orange object, the appearance of two new orange objects, and the border color change are all new, concrete observations from this action's effect. This makes the definition more precise and complete, incorporating all observed changes.
