1. The movable block (player) changed shape from a 4x4 block to a C-shaped block (Color 8) and appeared at a new position (48,12) as a result of ACTION2.
2. ACTION2 caused the disappearance of a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0), suggesting it was a consumable or temporary obstacle/element.
3. The outermost top-left border area, previously light pink (Color 13), changed to a different color (Color 11) with ACTION2. This indicates dynamic behavior even in the outermost border/UI elements, possibly a feedback mechanism.
