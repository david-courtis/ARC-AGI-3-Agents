The dynamic Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) that was at (8, 56) (on the right side) disappeared, and a new Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) appeared on the left side of the play area at (8, 4). No other objects changed state.",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "Moves the movable block two units in the specified direction. If the block is at (28,28) and ACTION3 is taken, it moves two units to the right instead of left, from (28,28) to (28,30). It consistently causes the dynamic Color 14 block on the right side to disappear and a new dynamic Color 14 block (4x48) to appear on the left side, shifting the horizontal play area. This action also handles specific movement logic when the block is at (28,28) causing a rightward movement.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": false,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable block was at (28, 28). There was a dynamic right side boundary at (8, 56) that facilitated its disappearance and the appearance of the left boundary. This specific context of the block's position (28,28) caused the 'move left' action to behave as a 'move right' instead, contradicting the semantic hint for ACTION3 and its observed behavior in a previous instance.",
