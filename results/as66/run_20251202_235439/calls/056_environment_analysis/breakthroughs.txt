1. Confirmed current state of the Movable Block (Player) as Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, moving two units down as a direct result of ACTION2.
2. ACTION2 causes the disappearance of a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) and the appearance of a Dynamic Side Boundary (Right, Color 14, 4x48 at (56,8)). This reinforces the idea that dynamic boundaries are intrinsically linked to actions and can shift across the entire play area, not just move left/right or top/bottom in isolation for an action, but convert between types (top to right).
