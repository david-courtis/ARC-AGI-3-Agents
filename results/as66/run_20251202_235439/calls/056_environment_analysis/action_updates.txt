ACTION2: ACTION2 moves the primary movable block two units down. If successful, it causes the dynamic top border (if present) to disappear and a new dynamic right border (Color 14, 4x48, at (56,8)) to appear. It also moves the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to the left by two units.
  Reason: Previous observations of ACTION2 were too broad or focused on shape/color changes that now appear to be state-dependent rather than integral to the action itself. This update focuses on the consistent observed movement of the main block downwards, the appearance/disappearance of specific dynamic boundaries, and the movement of other objects, based on the current and previous analyses of ACTION2 effects.
