ACTION1: ACTION1 attempts to move the movable block two units upwards. If the movable block is NOT obstructed, it moves two units upwards, causes a dynamic right boundary (Color 14) to DISAPPEAR, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to APPEAR. This action also causes other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block to move two units to the LEFT. This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.
  Reason: The movable block explicitly moved up. The right boundary disappeared and a top boundary appeared. The two other movable blocks also moved left. Previous definition needed to be updated with new movement and boundary changes.
