  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had 3 consecutive no-effects and is verified. We must move the player block before re-testing any action that caused a no-effect. ACTION3 is a pending movement action that has shown to move the movable block left and shift dynamic boundaries effectively, allowing us to change the state significantly. After moving, ACTION1 is a high-priority action to test, as its behavior is currently inconsistent (sometimes moves block up, sometimes doesn't but moves other objects and changes boundaries). Further testing of ACTION1, especially after a change in position, will clarify its conditional behavior.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Testing ACTION3 will provide more consistent observations for its movement behavior (2/3 consistent so far) and boundary changes. After this setup, testing ACTION1 will help determine the conditions under which it moves the main block versus causing other objects to move and boundary changes. We need to identify what prevents direct upward movement of the player block in certain states.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable block is currently 'blocked' to the right where ACTION5 would move it, and ACTION1 has previously shown inconsistent behavior (sometimes moving the block, sometimes just moving other elements). This current state is not ideal for testing these actions due to potential blockages. By using ACTION3, we can move the movable block to a new position, potentially changing the surrounding dynamic boundaries and creating a novel state for testing ACTION1."
