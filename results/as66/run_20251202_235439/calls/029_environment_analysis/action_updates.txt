ACTION5: ACTION5 attempts to move the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action is blocked if a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present.
  Reason: Previous observations confirmed ACTION5 had no visible effect and the 'BREAKTHROUGH' from the previous analysis explicitly states the dynamic right boundary blocked the movement. This refines the definition to include the blocking condition.
