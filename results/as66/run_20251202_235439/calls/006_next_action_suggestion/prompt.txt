Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 seems to be an action that does not always have a visible effect. Further observations are required to determine its specific function or target.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION2 moves the 4x4 color 8 block four units down, causes a color change of the block at (4,8) from color 14 to color 12, and triggers the appearance of new elements, including a 13x1 color 13 block at (0,25) and a 48x4 color 14 block at (56,8) which appears to be a dynamic right border. It also causes the appearance of a 13x1 Color 13 block at (0,25).
  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)

BORDER: Yes (Color 3 (green), Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 2 (yellow), Color 13 (light pink))
  Description: The play area is enclosed by a complex, multi-colored border. The outermost border appears to be a single row/column of Color 3 (green) and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside this, on the left and top, there's a two-pixel thick border, with the outermost layer being Color 10 (light blue) and the inner layer being Color 14 (dark blue). On the right, it's also two pixels thick (Color 10 and Color 14). At the bottom, there is a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) covering most of the width, sitting above a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). It is bordered on the sides by a 1-pixel wide, 2-pixel tall Color 3 (green) block on the left at (56,8) and a 48x4 color 14 block on the right at (56,8). The top border also has a magenta (Color 5) single pixel line that appears to be a UI element.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.
  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.
  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).
  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.
  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).
  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area where game actions occur)
      Evidence: Most objects are within this area. It appears to be 'empty space' for movement, apart from the other objects.
  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role hypothesis: Static obstacles or terrain elements)
      Evidence: They do not move. Objects appear to be on top or around them. Their irregular shape suggests they are part of the environment layout rather than movable game pieces.
  - Movable Block: Color 8 (black) 4x4 rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)
      Evidence: ACTION2 explicitly moved this block four units down. This confirms it is a movable object.
  - Orange collectible/target: Color 4 (orange) Single square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)
      Evidence: Unique color and small size, often indicative of items to be picked up or reached in grid-based games. No direct interactions yet observed, so this is a 'UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS'.
  - UI element/Score indicator (magenta): Color 5 (magenta) Small rectangular bar (4x1) on the top border (Role hypothesis: UI Element, possibly a move counter or score)
      Evidence: Located outside the main play area, at the very top. Its small and uniform size suggests a counter, but no change has been observed yet. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS)
  - UI/Boundary Element (green top): Color 3 (green) Line/Border segment (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Part of the outer border or a UI element)
      Evidence: It forms the outermost visual boundary at the top of the screen. Its consistency suggests a fixed environmental property.
  - UI/Boundary Element (light blue): Color 10 (light blue) Thin border line (64x1 at top, and ~1x56 vertical) (Role hypothesis: Outer layer of the primary play area border)
      Evidence: Consistently forms a border around the main red play area, inside the green outer border.
  - UI/Boundary Element (dark blue): Color 14 (dark blue) Thin border line (60x1 at top, and ~1x56 vertical) (Role hypothesis: Inner layer of the primary play area border)
      Evidence: Sits inside the light blue border, creating a double-layered boundary for the play area.
  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary at the bottom of the play area)
      Evidence: A distinct, solid bar at the very bottom of the primary play space. The movement of the black block four units down suggests it might have hit this or the green bar below it, indicating a floor. The observation 'Appeared: Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) at (0, 25)' is confusing given its appearance in the image at the bottom, possibly indicating a dynamic boundary, or an error in bounding box for the 'appeared' object.
  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar, possibly also a UI/score element)
      Evidence: Located directly below the pink bar, consistently forming the lowest part of the play field. The existence of a single-pixel wide, 2-pixel tall Color 3 (green) block on the left at (56,8) is anomalous and likely a bounding box error (should be (48,56) if it's the right boundary of the green floor).
  - UI/Boundary Element (yellow): Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Outermost bottom border)
      Evidence: Forms the absolute bottom of the entire screen display, suggesting a fixed environmental boundary.
  - Changing Block: Color 12 (grey) (previously Color 14) Single square block (Role hypothesis: Interactive element whose state changes)
      Evidence: Its color changed from 14 to 12 as a direct result of ACTION2, indicating it's an interactive element, possibly a switch, trigger, or a 'life' counter for some other object. The specific location (4,8) suggests it might be connected to an event or goal.
  - Appearing Right Side Block: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic boundary or an effect of the action)
      Evidence: The object 'Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8)' appeared as a result of ACTION2. This is extremely significant. Given its dimensions, it seems to suggest a wall or boundary element appearing on the right side of the play area, possibly indicating a game phase change or a consequence of movement. Its location suggests it's a right border element. However, the original image shows a dark blue border at the right, its coordinates are (55,8) to (55, 59) which match perfectly an existing border. The 'appeared' event strongly suggests that the existing border was not there before the action and then appeared. (Correction to previous understanding, this is a border APPEARING)

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What triggers the color change of the block at (4,8)? Is it any 'downward' movement, or specific to the 4x4 block, or to a specific position?
  - What is the exact role of the appearing Color 14 block (48x4) at (56,8)? Is it always a boundary, or can it be an obstacle? Could its appearance restrict future movement to the right?
  - What is the role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?
  - What is the significance of the small Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) that 'appeared' at (0, 25)? Its small size and location are currently unclear in the overall environment context.
  - What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?
  - Can objects move through the green 'landmasses' or are they solid obstacles?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - The 4x4 block of color 8 is a movable object.
  - The object at (4, 8) is a mutable object whose color can be changed.
  - New blocks can appear as a consequence of this action.
