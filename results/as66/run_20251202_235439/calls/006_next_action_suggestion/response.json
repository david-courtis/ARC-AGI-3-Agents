  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3, ACTION4, and ACTION5 have no observations yet, making them the highest priority to test. Given the previous ACTION1 (move up) had no effect in the current state and ACTION2 (move down) resulted in significant changes, it is strategic to test a new direction, ACTION3 (move left). We don't have any verified movement actions yet, so a setup sequence is not possible using those. Testing a completely unobserved action is the most efficient next step for gaining new information.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the effect of moving left. This will confirm if ACTION3 causes the 4x4 black block to move left, if it interacts with any borders or green 'landmasses', or if it triggers any other environmental changes. This will help us start verifying ACTION3.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state is suitable for testing horizontal movement. The 4x4 black block is centered enough horizontally that it has space to move left without immediately hitting a border (depending on how far it moves). There are green 'landmasses' to its left that it might interact with, which could reveal collision mechanics."
