The Color 13 rectangular block (4x4) that was at (12,32) moved two units to the left to (12,30).

  "new_definition": "ACTION1 attempts to move the movable block two units upwards. If successful, it moves two units upwards, causes a dynamic bottom boundary (Color 14) to DISAPPEAR, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to APPEAR. This action also causes other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block to move two units to the LEFT. If the movable block IS obstructed from moving upwards, it does NOT move. Instead, other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) move horizontally by two units, and a dynamic side boundary DISAPPEARS while a dynamic top boundary APPEARS. The direction of secondary object movement depends on the currently present dynamic side boundary: if a left dynamic boundary is present, they move LEFT; if a right dynamic boundary is present, they move RIGHT. The movable block's color and shape are not changed by this action.",

There was a green 'landmass' (Color 4: 8x12 shape at (20,20)) directly above and overlapping all four cells of the movable block by a few pixels, which acted as an obstacle and prevented its upward movement. The presence of the dynamic right side boundary (Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8,56)) determined the horizontal movement direction of the other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) to the right, and enabled its disappearance causing a dynamic top boundary to appear.",

    "ACTION1, when blocked for the 'Movable Block (Player)', causes the 'Moving Irregular Block' to move two units right when the Dynamic Side Boundary (Right) is present.",
    "ACTION1, when blocked for the 'Movable Block (Player)', causes the 'Moving Rectangular Block' to move two units left when the Dynamic Side Boundary (Right) is present. This contradicts the previous analysis that it moves right when the dynamic right boundary is present. It implies that their behavior is not always synchronized.",
    "Clarification: The 'Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle' at (20,20) is an 8x12 shape, but the specific part acting as an obstacle to the movable block at (24,32) would be its lower part overlapping row 20 with column 32, creating the 'overlapping cells' mentioned. This confirms that these landmasses act as direct physical obstacles to movement."
