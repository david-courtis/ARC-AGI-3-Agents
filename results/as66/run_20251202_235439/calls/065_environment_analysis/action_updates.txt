ACTION4: ACTION4 moves the movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block two units to the right. It causes the existing dynamic left boundary (Color 14, 4x48) to disappear, and a new dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) to appear. Other independent elements, the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13), also move two units to the right. This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.
  Reason: Previous observations confirm the player moves two units right. This specific action explicitly showed the dynamic left boundary disappear and a dynamic right boundary appear. It also clarified that the other two movable blocks also move two units to the right in sync with the player's movement for this action.
