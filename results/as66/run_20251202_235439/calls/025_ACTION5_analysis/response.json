Given the lack of effect and the fact that there are no obvious other objects at (28,24) that would visibly respond to an interaction, selection, or rotation, this suggests either no interactable object was present at the block's current position, or the effect (if any) is not visually represented, or the action may require a different context (e.g., proximity to a specific object, or a different game phase).",
