  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION2 has only 1/8 attempts and needs more validation. It previously had an effect, thus it is unlikely to be blocked in the current state. ACTION1 has recently been a no-op twice, so it is better to test an action that has consistently shown an effect. ACTION3 and ACTION4 also have few attempts but were last tested when the movable block was in a different position. ACTION5 is verified and was recently a no-op consecutively, indicating it is likely blocked by the dynamic right boundary which is present.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Further validate the effect of ACTION2, especially regarding the movement of the 4x4 black block, the color change, and the dynamic right border appearance. This will bring us closer to verifying ACTION2.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable 4x4 black block is at (28,24). The dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present, which usually blocks rightward movement (ACTION5). The dynamic left boundary is not present, and the dynamic top boundary is not present. This state is suitable for testing downward movement."
