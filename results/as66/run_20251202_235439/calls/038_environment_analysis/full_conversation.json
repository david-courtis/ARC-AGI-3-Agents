BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective.

This implies boundaries are not always static.\n- Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n- Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n- Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n- Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n- Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.\n- Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.\n- Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.\n- Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.\n- ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.\n- Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).\n- Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.\n- Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.\n- Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.\n- Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.\n- The movable block (player) changed shape from a 4x4 block to a C-shaped block (Color 8) and appeared at a new position (48,12) as a result of ACTION2.\n- ACTION2 caused the disappearance of a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0), suggesting it was a consumable or temporary obstacle/element.\n- The outermost top-left border area, previously light pink (Color 13), changed to a different color (Color 11) with ACTION2. This indicates dynamic behavior even in the outermost border/UI elements, possibly a feedback mechanism.\n- The movable player block, previously identified as black, is now described as Color 11, and the current state shows a Color 8 black C-shaped block. This indicates the player block can change color and shape based on actions. This observation resolves a discrepancy from a previous analysis's description of ACTION4 (which stated Color 11 for the player block that moved left), and this current frame shows a black (Color 8) player block.\n- Explicit identification of new UI elements appearing: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40). These are outside the main play area, suggesting they are UI or game state indicators, possibly related to moves or progress.\n- The movable block moved left by four units as a result of ACTION4, providing more specific movement distance for this action.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What triggers the appearance/disappearance of the dynamic boundaries? Is it specific to movement direction, position, or an internal game state?\n- What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n- What happens when the movable block interacts with the orange collectible?\n- What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n- Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n- Is the appearance of a dynamic top boundary tied to specific vertical movement or reaching a specific vertical coordinate?\n- What is the exact mechanism causing the outermost top-left border area to change color (Color 13 to Color 11) and what does this color change signify?\n- What is the significance of the grey block (Color 12) disappearing as a consequence of ACTION2?\n- What is the role of the newly appeared Color 13 and Color 12 UI elements (from ACTION4)? Are they move counters, score, or something else?\n- How does the movable block's color and shape change (from black 4x4 to C-shaped black for ACTION2, and Color 11 for ACTION4)? Is Color 11 another form, or was the previous observation of color an error?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 moves the movable 4x4 black block two units upwards if unobstructed. It also dynamically alters a border element: if a dynamic side border (Color 14, 4x48) was present, it disappears, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) appears at (4,8). If the movable block is blocked (e.g., by another object or the top of the play area), it will not move.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 transforms the player-controlled block from a 4x4 block into a C-shaped block (Color 8) and places it at (48,12). It also causes a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0) to disappear, causes an orange irregular shape (20x12) to move from (8,32) to (10,30), and two new orange irregular shapes to appear at (40,28) and (44,44). Additionally, it changes the color of the outermost top-left border area from Color 13 to Color 11.\"\n  ACTION3: \"Moves the movable block two units in the specified direction. If the block is at (28,28) and ACTION3 is taken, it moves two units to the right instead of left, from (28,28) to (28,30). It consistently causes the dynamic Color 14 block on the right side to disappear and a new dynamic Color 14 block (4x48) to appear on the left side, shifting the horizontal play area. This action also handles specific movement logic when the block is at (28,28) causing a rightward movement.\"\n  ACTION4: \"ACTION4 moves the movable block four units to the left. This action also causes the dynamic left-side Color 14 block to disappear and a new dynamic right-side Color 14 block to appear. Additionally, new UI elements appear: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40).\"\n  ACTION5: \"ACTION5 attempts to move the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action is blocked if a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
