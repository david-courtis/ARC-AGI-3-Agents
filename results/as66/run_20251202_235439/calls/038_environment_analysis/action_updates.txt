ACTION3: ACTION3 moves the movable block two units to the right. It consistently causes the dynamic Color 14 block on the right side to disappear and a new dynamic Color 14 block (4x48) to appear on the left side, shifting the horizontal play area. The movable block also changes its appearance to a Color 11 rectangular block if it was previously in another form (e.g., C-shaped).
  Reason: Observed that ACTION3 explicitly moved the block two units right, confirming the move distance and direction. Also, the movable block in this action is described as Color 11 rectangular, confirming shape and color changes are tied to the action beyond just the C-shape from ACTION2. It also causes the dynamic right boundary to disappear and a new left boundary to appear.
