1. The movable block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28,28) to (28,30).
2. Discrepancy resolved: The player block's previous description of 'Color 11' from ACTION4 analysis was likely a temporary state or error; its current observable state and previous ACTION2 state is Color 8 C-shaped, and this action's effect confirms a Color 11 rectangular block. This suggests the player block can change both shape and color depending on the action or state.
