This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).",

The small 13x1 color 13 block at (0,25) was likely a misinterpretation of the appearance of the dynamic side boundary.",
      "reasoning": "The recent observations for ACTION3 show a large dynamic block on the left (4x48) appearing, and the previous dynamic block (48x4) on the right disappearing. This suggests that the '13x1 color 13 block at (0,25)' mentioned in ACTION2's description was likely incorrect and it was instead the start of a dynamic Color 14 boundary similar to what just appeared on the left. Also, the 'changing block' at (4,8) is no longer present after ACTION3, implying its fate is tied to these dynamic boundaries."

      "reasoning": "The observed state change clearly shows the black block moving left, the right boundary disappearing, and a left boundary appearing. The 'changing block' at (4,8) also disappeared, linking its existence to the dynamic boundaries."
