ACTION2: Moves the 4x4 color 8 block four units down, causes a color change of the block at (4,8) from color 14 to color 12, and triggers the appearance of a dynamic Color 14 block (48x4) at (56,8) which appears to be a dynamic right border. The small 13x1 color 13 block at (0,25) was likely a misinterpretation of the appearance of the dynamic side boundary.
  Reason: The recent observations for ACTION3 show a large dynamic block on the left (4x48) appearing, and the previous dynamic block (48x4) on the right disappearing. This suggests that the '13x1 color 13 block at (0,25)' mentioned in ACTION2's description was likely incorrect and it was instead the start of a dynamic Color 14 boundary similar to what just appeared on the left. Also, the 'changing block' at (4,8) is no longer present after ACTION3, implying its fate is tied to these dynamic boundaries.

ACTION3: Moves the movable block 2 units to the left. Causes the dynamic Color 14 block previously on the right side to disappear and a new dynamic Color 14 block (4x48) to appear on the left side, shifting the horizontal play area. Also causes the disappearance of the 'changing block' at (4,8).
  Reason: The observed state change clearly shows the black block moving left, the right boundary disappearing, and a left boundary appearing. The 'changing block' at (4,8) also disappeared, linking its existence to the dynamic boundaries.
