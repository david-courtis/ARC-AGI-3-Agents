BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective. Make BREAKTHROUGHS in understanding. Don't just describe - ANALYZE.\nWhen you notice something new, explain its SIGNIFICANCE for gameplay.\nWhen previous understanding was WRONG, explicitly note the correction."

Regions affected: lower_left_playarea (192), upper_left_playarea (112), lower_right_playarea (96), upper_right_playarea (16), top_ui (12) Changes in both play area and UI elements.

The outermost border appears to be a single row/column of Color 3 (green) and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside this, on the left and top, there's a two-pixel thick border, with the outermost layer being Color 10 (light blue) and the inner layer being Color 14 (dark blue). On the right, it's also two pixels thick (Color 10 and Color 14). At the bottom, there is a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) covering most of the width, sitting above a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). It is bordered on the sides by a 1-pixel wide, 2-pixel tall Color 3 (green) block on the left at (56,8) and a 48x4 color 14 block on the right at (56,8). The top border also has a magenta (Color 5) single pixel line that appears to be a UI element.\nKnown movement constraints:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\nIdentified objects:\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role: The main play area where game actions occur)\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role: Static obstacles or terrain elements)\n  - Movable Block: Color 8 (black) 4x4 rectangular block (Role: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)\n  - Orange collectible/target: Color 4 (orange) Single square block (Role: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n  - UI element/Score indicator (magenta): Color 5 (magenta) Small rectangular bar (4x1) on the top border (Role: UI Element, possibly a move counter or score)\n  - UI/Boundary Element (green top): Color 3 (green) Line/Border segment (64x1) (Role: Part of the outer border or a UI element)\n  - UI/Boundary Element (light blue): Color 10 (light blue) Thin border line (64x1 at top, and ~1x56 vertical) (Role: Outer layer of the primary play area border)\n  - UI/Boundary Element (dark blue): Color 14 (dark blue) Thin border line (60x1 at top, and ~1x56 vertical) (Role: Inner layer of the primary play area border)\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role: Definite floor or boundary at the bottom of the play area)\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar, possibly also a UI/score element)\n  - UI/Boundary Element (yellow): Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role: Outermost bottom border)\n  - Changing Block: Color 12 (grey) (previously Color 14) Single square block (Role: Interactive element whose state changes)\n  - Appearing Right Side Block: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role: Dynamic boundary or an effect of the action)\nSpatial structure: Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n- Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n- Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n- Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n- Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What triggers the color change of the block at (4,8)? Is it any 'downward' movement, or specific to the 4x4 block, or to a specific position?\n- What is the exact role of the appearing Color 14 block (48x4) at (56,8)? Is it always a boundary, or can it be an obstacle? Could its appearance restrict future movement to the right?\n- What is the role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n- What is the significance of the small Color 13 rectangular block (13x1) that 'appeared' at (0, 25)? Its small size and location are currently unclear in the overall environment context.\n- What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n- Can objects move through the green 'landmasses' or are they solid obstacles?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 seems to be an action that does not always have a visible effect. Further observations are required to determine its specific function or target.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 moves the 4x4 color 8 block four units down, causes a color change of the block at (4,8) from color 14 to color 12, and triggers the appearance of new elements, including a 13x1 color 13 block at (0,25) and a 48x4 color 14 block at (56,8) which appears to be a dynamic right border. It also causes the appearance of a 13x1 Color 13 block at (0,25).\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 moves the movable block 2 units to the left. It also causes the previous dynamic right boundary to disappear and a new dynamic left boundary to appear.\"\n  ACTION4: (no definition yet)\n  ACTION5: (no definition yet)\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
