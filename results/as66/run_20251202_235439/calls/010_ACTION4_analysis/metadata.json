  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nThis is the FIRST time observing this action.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple colors (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink))\n  Description: The play area is enclosed by a complex, multi-colored border. The outermost border appears to be a single row/column of Color 3 (green) at the top/left/right and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside this, on the top, left and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with the outermost layer being Color 10 (light blue) and the inner layer being Color 14 (dark blue). At the bottom, there are distinct Color 13 (light pink) and Color 3 (green) bars. The left side has a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) from (8,0). The right side has a dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) block (48x4). The top border also has a magenta (Color 5) single pixel line that appears to be a UI element.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area where game actions occur)\n      Evidence: It is the dominant color in the central region and objects move within it.\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role hypothesis: Static obstacles or terrain elements)\n      Evidence: They do not move and the movable block was not observed to move through them, suggesting they block movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be collectible)\n  - Movable Block: Color 8 (black) 4x4 rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)\n      Evidence: Observed to move left by ACTION3 and down by ACTION2. Its movement causes other environmental changes.\n  - Orange collectible/target: Color 4 (orange) Single square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Its small size suggests it is an item to be collected or interacted with by the player block.\n  - UI element/Score indicator (magenta): Color 5 (magenta) Small rectangular bar (4x1) on the top border (Role hypothesis: UI Element, possibly a move counter or score)\n      Evidence: Located at the very top, separate from the main play area, suggesting a meta-game function. It is small and linear.\n  - Outer Top/Left/Right Border: Color 3 (green) Thin lines forming the outermost boundary (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary of the game world)\n      Evidence: Forms the very edge of the observed space; objects are not seen beyond it.\n  - Outer Bottom Border: Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Outermost bottom boundary of the game world)\n      Evidence: Forms the very bottom edge of the observed space; objects are not seen beyond it.\n  - Light Blue Border Layer: Color 10 (light blue) Thin lines, inner to the green border, outer to the dark blue border (Role hypothesis: Mid-layer of the play area border)\n      Evidence: Provides a visual separation and likely defines the physical limit of the playable area.\n  - Dark Blue Border Layer: Color 14 (dark blue) Thin lines, inner to the light blue border (Role hypothesis: Inner layer of the primary play area border)\n      Evidence: Directly encloses the red play area, providing the most immediate boundary.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or critical boundary at the bottom of the play area)\n      Evidence: Located at the bottom of the visible play area, above the green and yellow bars. Suggests an impassable floor.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar)\n      Evidence: Located below the pink bar, suggesting a further boundary or part of the play area floor. Its width suggests it's part of the main grid structure.\n  - Changing Block: Color 12 (grey) Single square block (Role hypothesis: Interactive element whose state changes)\n      Evidence: Changed color from Color 14 to Color 12 due to ACTION2. Its initial position was (4,8) (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: Now appears gone due to ACTION3 or it was part of the dynamic boundary)\n  - Dynamic Left Side Block: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic boundary or an effect of the action, potentially restricting movement to the left)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (8,4) as previous dynamic right boundary disappeared after ACTION3, indicating a shifting boundary or block of space.\n  - Dynamic Right Side Block (Disappeared): Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic boundary or an effect of the action, restricting movement to the right)\n      Evidence: Appeared after ACTION2, and disappeared after ACTION3, showing it's a transient environmental feature.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What triggers the color change of the block at (4,8) (now absent)? Was it specific to position or type of movement?\n  - What is the exact role of the appearing dynamic Color 14 side blocks? Are they always exclusionary boundaries or can the player interact with them?\n  - What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n  - What happens when the movable block interacts with the green 'landmasses' or the orange collectible?\n  - What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n  - Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 8 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Right Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4 at (56,8)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The object at (4, 8) is a mutable object whose color can be changed.\n  - New blocks can appear as a consequence of this action.\n  - The 4x4 black block is confirmed as a movable object that can move horizontally, in this case, 2 units to the left.\n  - The border elements previously identified as 'dynamic' are indeed dynamic and can appear and disappear. This action caused the disappearance of the right-side dynamic border and the appearance of a similar new left-side dynamic border. This suggests these blocks function as temporary walls or barriers that change based on gameplay actions.\n  - The movement of the black block is 2 units left, not necessarily 'decrease column/x by 1' as originally hinted. This contradicts the semantic hint.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nTotal: 429 pixels changed.

The appearance and disappearance of specific border elements might be a consequence of the action itself, or part of a larger 'level design' or 'stage progression' mechanism.

          "text": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.\n\nSEMANTIC HINT: ACTION4 is expected to mean \"Move RIGHT (increase column/x)\" (but verify through observation!)\n\nThis is the FIRST time observing this action.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple colors (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink))\n  Description: The play area is enclosed by a complex, multi-colored border. The outermost border appears to be a single row/column of Color 3 (green) at the top/left/right and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside this, on the top, left and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with the outermost layer being Color 10 (light blue) and the inner layer being Color 14 (dark blue). At the bottom, there are distinct Color 13 (light pink) and Color 3 (green) bars. The left side has a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) from (8,0). The right side has a dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) block (48x4). The top border also has a magenta (Color 5) single pixel line that appears to be a UI element.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area where game actions occur)\n      Evidence: It is the dominant color in the central region and objects move within it.\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role hypothesis: Static obstacles or terrain elements)\n      Evidence: They do not move and the movable block was not observed to move through them, suggesting they block movement. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be collectible)\n  - Movable Block: Color 8 (black) 4x4 rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)\n      Evidence: Observed to move left by ACTION3 and down by ACTION2. Its movement causes other environmental changes.\n  - Orange collectible/target: Color 4 (orange) Single square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: Its small size suggests it is an item to be collected or interacted with by the player block.\n  - UI element/Score indicator (magenta): Color 5 (magenta) Small rectangular bar (4x1) on the top border (Role hypothesis: UI Element, possibly a move counter or score)\n      Evidence: Located at the very top, separate from the main play area, suggesting a meta-game function. It is small and linear.\n  - Outer Top/Left/Right Border: Color 3 (green) Thin lines forming the outermost boundary (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary of the game world)\n      Evidence: Forms the very edge of the observed space; objects are not seen beyond it.\n  - Outer Bottom Border: Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Outermost bottom boundary of the game world)\n      Evidence: Forms the very bottom edge of the observed space; objects are not seen beyond it.\n  - Light Blue Border Layer: Color 10 (light blue) Thin lines, inner to the green border, outer to the dark blue border (Role hypothesis: Mid-layer of the play area border)\n      Evidence: Provides a visual separation and likely defines the physical limit of the playable area.\n  - Dark Blue Border Layer: Color 14 (dark blue) Thin lines, inner to the light blue border (Role hypothesis: Inner layer of the primary play area border)\n      Evidence: Directly encloses the red play area, providing the most immediate boundary.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or critical boundary at the bottom of the play area)\n      Evidence: Located at the bottom of the visible play area, above the green and yellow bars. Suggests an impassable floor.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar)\n      Evidence: Located below the pink bar, suggesting a further boundary or part of the play area floor. Its width suggests it's part of the main grid structure.\n  - Changing Block: Color 12 (grey) Single square block (Role hypothesis: Interactive element whose state changes)\n      Evidence: Changed color from Color 14 to Color 12 due to ACTION2. Its initial position was (4,8) (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: Now appears gone due to ACTION3 or it was part of the dynamic boundary)\n  - Dynamic Left Side Block: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic boundary or an effect of the action, potentially restricting movement to the left)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (8,4) as previous dynamic right boundary disappeared after ACTION3, indicating a shifting boundary or block of space.\n  - Dynamic Right Side Block (Disappeared): Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: Dynamic boundary or an effect of the action, restricting movement to the right)\n      Evidence: Appeared after ACTION2, and disappeared after ACTION3, showing it's a transient environmental feature.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What triggers the color change of the block at (4,8) (now absent)? Was it specific to position or type of movement?\n  - What is the exact role of the appearing dynamic Color 14 side blocks? Are they always exclusionary boundaries or can the player interact with them?\n  - What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n  - What happens when the movable block interacts with the green 'landmasses' or the orange collectible?\n  - What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n  - Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 8 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Right Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4 at (56,8)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The object at (4, 8) is a mutable object whose color can be changed.\n  - New blocks can appear as a consequence of this action.\n  - The 4x4 black block is confirmed as a movable object that can move horizontally, in this case, 2 units to the left.\n  - The border elements previously identified as 'dynamic' are indeed dynamic and can appear and disappear. This action caused the disappearance of the right-side dynamic border and the appearance of a similar new left-side dynamic border. This suggests these blocks function as temporary walls or barriers that change based on gameplay actions.\n  - The movement of the black block is 2 units left, not necessarily 'decrease column/x by 1' as originally hinted. This contradicts the semantic hint.\n\nFRAME CHANGES (before → final state, pixel level):\nTotal: 429 pixels changed.

showing you a SEQUENCE of 6 images:\n1. Frame BEFORE the action (first image)\n2-6. Animation frames 1-5 showing the motion (subsequent images)\n\nWatch the FULL MOTION to understand how objects move (they may slide multiple units!)\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Think about changes at the OBJECT level, not just pixels!\n2. If there are MULTIPLE animation frames, track the FULL MOTION path of objects\n3. REASON about WHY this action produced THIS outcome in THIS context\n4. If the action had NO EFFECT, explain what context caused that (wall? edge? wrong object?)\n5. If the action HAD EFFECT, explain what context enabled that effect\n6. Only set update_definition=true if you need to CHANGE the definition. If the current definition is accurate, set update_definition=false.\n7. If an object changes position or features, analyze what ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES limit/define/bound the change. What stopped the object? What caused the change to occur in that specific way? All needed information is visible in the environment.\n\nAnalyze what happened and provide your structured analysis."
