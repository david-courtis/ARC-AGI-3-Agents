  "prompt": "Analyze the effect of action ACTION5.\n\nYOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION5:\n\"ACTION5 attempts to move the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action is blocked if the movable block's path is obstructed by a dynamic right-side boundary (Color 14) or other obstacles.\"\n\nPREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):\n  [1] NO EFFECT\n      Context: The game state contained a movable 4x4 black block at (28,40) and a dynamic Color 14 boundary on the right side of the play area at (8,56). Other background and border elements were also present.\n      Interpretation: No visible changes occurred after ACTION5 was taken. All objects remained in their original positions and no changes in appearance were detected at the pixel level. The movable black block did not move, nor did any other identified dynamic element change state.\n  [2] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The game state contained a movable 4x4 black block at (28,40) and a dynamic Color 14 boundary on the right side of the play area at (8,56). Other background and border elements were also present, including green 'landmass' objects. No specific object was at the exact (28,40) coordinate which a 'select' action might target.\n      Interpretation: No visible changes occurred after ACTION5 was taken. All objects remained in their original positions and no changes in appearance were detected at the pixel level. The movable black block did not move, nor did any other identified dynamic element change state.\n  [3] NO EFFECT (consistent)\n      Context: The game state contained a movable 4x4 black block at (28,24). A dynamic Color 14 boundary was on the right side of the play area at (8,56). Green 'landmass' elements were present starting at (24,24) and (24,28) above the black block. There was no direct obstacle immediately to the right for the block.\n      Interpretation: No visible changes occurred after ACTION5 was taken. All objects remained in their original positions and no changes in appearance were detected at the pixel level. The movable black block did not move, nor did any other identified dynamic element change state.\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink, magenta))\n  Description: The outermost boundary is a single pixel thick: Color 3 (green) on top, left, and right, and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside the green top, left, and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with Color 10 (light blue) outermost and Color 14 (dark blue) inner. At the bottom, inside the green border, there's a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and below that a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). A 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar is at the very left edge (8,0). Dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) blocks appear and disappear on the left and right sides, changing the horizontal confines of the play area. A magenta (Color 5) single pixel line is on the very top, acting as a UI element. A dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) can also appear at (4,8).\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides. A dynamic top boundary can also appear.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.\n  - Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.\n  - Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.\n  - Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.\n  - ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).\n  - Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.\n  - Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.\n  - Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.\n  - Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - Movement is confined within the bounds defined by the static inner Color 14 border and the dynamically appearing Color 14 side blocks.\n  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner static Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be blocked by the existing dynamic right boundary, or the green 'landmass' next to it.)\n  - The movable black block can move upwards (as seen with ACTION1).\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5 by the existing dynamic right boundary.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role: Static obstacles or terrain elements)\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area where game actions occur)\n      Evidence: It is the largest consistent color in the center of the frame where all action happens.\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role hypothesis: Static obstacles or terrain elements that block movement or define pathways)\n      Evidence: These blocks are static across multiple actions and occupy space, suggesting they are obstacles.\n  - Movable Block: Color 8 (black) 4x4 rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)\n      Evidence: Observed moving in response to ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4, confirming it is controllable.\n  - Orange collectible/target: Color 4 (orange) Single square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: It is a distinct, small, isolated object in the play area, a common pattern for collectibles or targets in games.\n  - Outer Top/Left/Right Border: Color 3 (green) Thin lines forming the outermost boundary (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary of the game world, restricting movement beyond them.)\n      Evidence: It consistently forms the external edge of the game display with no objects moving past it.\n  - Outer Bottom Border: Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Outermost bottom boundary of the game world, definitively ending the play area downwards.)\n      Evidence: It consistently forms the very bottom edge of the game display, acting as a hard stop.\n  - Light Blue Border Layer: Color 10 (light blue) Thin lines, inner to the green border, outer to the dark blue border (Role hypothesis: Mid-layer of the play area border, further defining the playable space.)\n      Evidence: It is a consistent border element inside the green border across all observations.\n  - Inner Dark Blue Border Layer (Static): Color 14 (dark blue) Thin lines, inner to the light blue border (Role hypothesis: Inner layer of the primary play area border, forming a static enclosure within the larger dynamic boundaries.)\n      Evidence: It forms a consistent internal border inside the light blue border, defining a crucial part of the playable region.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or critical boundary at the bottom of the play area, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Located at the bottom of the main play area, consistently present, suggesting a floor or hard boundary.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Located directly below the pink bar at the bottom, suggesting another layer of floor or boundary.\n  - Persistent Left Static Element: Color 13 (light pink) 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall bar (Role hypothesis: A static, fixed boundary or visual marker on the far left.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present at (8,0) across multiple observations and not subject to the dynamic changes of other borders.\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears on either the left or right side, limiting the horizontal movement of the movable block.)\n      Evidence: Observed appearing and disappearing on left/right sides in response to ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and blocking movement in ACTION5.\n  - UI element/Score indicator: Color 5 (magenta) Single pixel line on the very top (Role hypothesis: UI Element, possibility of a move counter or score)\n      Evidence: Located at the very top edge, outside the main play area, and is a thin line, typical of UI elements.\n  - Dynamic Top Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears at the top, limiting vertical movement.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (4,8) after ACTION1, showing it restricts vertical space. Contradicts previous 'Changing Block' hypothesis.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What triggers the appearance/disappearance of the dynamic boundaries? Is it specific to movement direction, position, or an internal game state?\n  - What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n  - What happens when the movable block interacts with the orange collectible?\n  - What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n  - Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n  - Is the appearance of a dynamic top boundary tied to specific vertical movement or reaching a specific vertical coordinate?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 8 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Right Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4 at (56,8)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Dynamic Top Border (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The green 'landmass' / obstacle (Color 3) blocks upward movement of the movable block.\n  - ACTION1 moves the movable black block two units upwards.\n  - ACTION1 causes the current dynamic side border (Color 14, 4x48) to disappear.\n  - ACTION1 causes a dynamic top border (Color 14, 48x4) to appear. This implies that up/down movements result in dynamic top/bottom borders appearing/disappearing, similar to how left/right movements cause side borders to change.\n  - ACTION5, when applied in the current context, has no visible effect on the game state or any identified objects. This further suggests it either modifies an unseen game state, requires a specific target or condition not met, or performs an action without a clear visual manifestation. The 'no effect' is consistently observed in both instances where this action was taken, reinforcing this hypothesis.\n\nFRAME CHANGES:\nNO CHANGES\n\n\n\nAnalyze the BEFORE and AFTER frames and respond with your structured analysis.",

Given the semantic hint for ACTION5 as 'INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position', and the lack of observed effect, it's possible that there isn't an interactable object at the block's current position to interact with, or the 'interaction' effect is not visually represented, or perhaps it requires a different context (e.g., proximity to another object, or a different game phase). It's also possible that this action has no visual effect and changes only an internal game state (e.g., updates a counter or a flag). Given the previous analysis of ACTION1, where pixel changes were noted but no overt object movement, this action could also be causing unobservable pixel-level changes not captured in the current object detection or affecting UI elements without clear visual feedback.\nConsistent: True"

If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Multiple (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink, magenta))\n  Description: The outermost boundary is a single pixel thick: Color 3 (green) on top, left, and right, and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside the green top, left, and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with Color 10 (light blue) outermost and Color 14 (dark blue) inner. At the bottom, inside the green border, there's a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and below that a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). A 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar is at the very left edge (8,0). Dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) blocks appear and disappear on the left and right sides, changing the horizontal confines of the play area. A magenta (Color 5) single pixel line is on the very top, acting as a UI element. A dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) can also appear at (4,8).\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides. A dynamic top boundary can also appear.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.\n  - Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.\n  - Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.\n  - Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.\n  - ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.\n  - Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).\n  - Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.\n  - Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.\n  - Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.\n  - Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).\n  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).\n  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - Movement is confined within the bounds defined by the static inner Color 14 border and the dynamically appearing Color 14 side blocks.\n  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4).\n  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner static Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be blocked by the existing dynamic right boundary, or the green 'landmass' next to it.)\n  - The movable black block can move upwards (as seen with ACTION1).\n  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5 by the existing dynamic right boundary.\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role: Static obstacles or terrain elements)\n  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area where game actions occur)\n      Evidence: It is the largest consistent color in the center of the frame where all action happens.\n  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role hypothesis: Static obstacles or terrain elements that block movement or define pathways)\n      Evidence: These blocks are static across multiple actions and occupy space, suggesting they are obstacles.\n  - Movable Block: Color 8 (black) 4x4 rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)\n      Evidence: Observed moving in response to ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4, confirming it is controllable.\n  - Orange collectible/target: Color 4 (orange) Single square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)\n      Evidence: It is a distinct, small, isolated object in the play area, a common pattern for collectibles or targets in games.\n  - Outer Top/Left/Right Border: Color 3 (green) Thin lines forming the outermost boundary (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary of the game world, restricting movement beyond them.)\n      Evidence: It consistently forms the external edge of the game display with no objects moving past it.\n  - Outer Bottom Border: Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Outermost bottom boundary of the game world, definitively ending the play area downwards.)\n      Evidence: It consistently forms the very bottom edge of the game display, acting as a hard stop.\n  - Light Blue Border Layer: Color 10 (light blue) Thin lines, inner to the green border, outer to the dark blue border (Role hypothesis: Mid-layer of the play area border, further defining the playable space.)\n      Evidence: It is a consistent border element inside the green border across all observations.\n  - Inner Dark Blue Border Layer (Static): Color 14 (dark blue) Thin lines, inner to the light blue border (Role hypothesis: Inner layer of the primary play area border, forming a static enclosure within the larger dynamic boundaries.)\n      Evidence: It forms a consistent internal border inside the light blue border, defining a crucial part of the playable region.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or critical boundary at the bottom of the play area, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Located at the bottom of the main play area, consistently present, suggesting a floor or hard boundary.\n  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar, likely impassable.)\n      Evidence: Located directly below the pink bar at the bottom, suggesting another layer of floor or boundary.\n  - Persistent Left Static Element: Color 13 (light pink) 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall bar (Role hypothesis: A static, fixed boundary or visual marker on the far left.)\n      Evidence: Consistently present at (8,0) across multiple observations and not subject to the dynamic changes of other borders.\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears on either the left or right side, limiting the horizontal movement of the movable block.)\n      Evidence: Observed appearing and disappearing on left/right sides in response to ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, and blocking movement in ACTION5.\n  - UI element/Score indicator: Color 5 (magenta) Single pixel line on the very top (Role hypothesis: UI Element, possibility of a move counter or score)\n      Evidence: Located at the very top edge, outside the main play area, and is a thin line, typical of UI elements.\n  - Dynamic Top Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (48x4) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears at the top, limiting vertical movement.)\n      Evidence: Appeared at (4,8) after ACTION1, showing it restricts vertical space. Contradicts previous 'Changing Block' hypothesis.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What triggers the appearance/disappearance of the dynamic boundaries? Is it specific to movement direction, position, or an internal game state?\n  - What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n  - What happens when the movable block interacts with the orange collectible?\n  - What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n  - Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n  - Is the appearance of a dynamic top boundary tied to specific vertical movement or reaching a specific vertical coordinate?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Movable Block (Color 8 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Right Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4 at (56,8)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Appearing Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION3 action\n  - Dynamic Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action\n  - Dynamic Side Boundary (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Dynamic Top Border (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4): Involved in ACTION1 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The green 'landmass' / obstacle (Color 3) blocks upward movement of the movable block.\n  - ACTION1 moves the movable black block two units upwards.\n  - ACTION1 causes the current dynamic side border (Color 14, 4x48) to disappear.\n  - ACTION1 causes a dynamic top border (Color 14, 48x4) to appear. This implies that up/down movements result in dynamic top/bottom borders appearing/disappearing, similar to how left/right movements cause side borders to change.\n  - ACTION5, when applied in the current context, has no visible effect on the game state or any identified objects. This further suggests it either modifies an unseen game state, requires a specific target or condition not met, or performs an action without a clear visual manifestation. The 'no effect' is consistently observed in both instances where this action was taken, reinforcing this hypothesis.\n\nFRAME CHANGES (before → final state, pixel level):\nNO CHANGES\n\nOBJECT-LEVEL ANALYSIS (grouped by visual proximity/similarity):\nNo object-level changes detected\n\nOBJECTS BEFORE ACTION:\nDetected 16 objects:\n\nColor 1: 1 objects\n  - 52x56 shape at row 4, col 8\n\nColor 3: 1 objects\n  - 62x62 shape at row 1, col 1\n\nColor 4: 7 objects\n  - 4x4 block at row 4, col 4\n  - 4x4 block at row 4, col 56\n  - 20x12 shape at row 8, col 32\n  - 20x20 shape at row 12, col 12\n  - 16x16 shape at row 28, col 36\n  - 4x4 block at row 56, col 4\n  - 4x4 block at row 56, col 56\n\nColor 5: 1 objects\n  - 64x1 block at row 63, col 0\n\nColor 8: 1 objects\n  - 4x4 block at row 28, col 24\n\nColor 12: 2 objects\n  - 1x32 block at row 31, col 63\n  - 1x31 block at row 32, col 0\n\nColor 13: 1 objects\n  - 64x32 shape at row 0, col 0\n\nColor 14: 1 objects\n  - 4x48 block at row 8, col 4\n\nColor 15: 1 objects\n  - 48x48 shape at row 8, col 8\n\nI'm showing you:\n1.
