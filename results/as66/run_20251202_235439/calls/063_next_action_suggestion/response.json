  "reasoning": "All actions ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4 are still unverified and need more observations. ACTION5 is verified. The Movable Block's current position is (28,32). In the past, ACTION3 from (24,24) had no effect on the movable block, but caused other objects to move and boundary changes. However, in the very last action, ACTION3 was successful from (28,30) moving the block to (28,28). ACTION1 and ACTION2 have also been observed to move the block successfully. There are no recent no-op attempts for ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, or ACTION4. ACTION4 previously moved the block from (28,30) to (28,34) and also from (28,28) to (28,32). Testing ACTION4 again from the current position (28,32) will provide another observation for its effect and help verify it. There's no immediately obvious obstacle to the right of (28,32) that would prevent ACTION4 from moving the block right, unlike ACTION3 at (24,24) which was blocked. Given that ACTION3 was successful from (28,30) moving to (28,28) (which is LEFT for the Movable Block), making a RIGHT move with ACTION4 from (28,32) seems like a good next step to gather more consistent data for its verification. We need to collect 3 consistent observations for each action to verify it.",
  "expected_information_gain": "This attempt will provide a critical new observation for ACTION4's movement properties, especially whether it consistently moves the block two units to the right from different starting positions. It will also reveal how the other dynamic elements (Moving Irregular Block, Moving Rectangular Block, and dynamic boundaries) respond to a successful ACTION4 from this specific state. This will contribute towards verifying ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The current board state shows the Movable Block (Color 11, rectangular, 4x4) at (28,32). There is a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4) at (4,8). The Moving Irregular Block (Color 12, 12x12) is at (32,24) and the Moving Rectangular Block (Color 13, 4x4) is at (12,24). The main playable area appears relatively clear around the movable block, suggesting a movement action is likely to succeed. No obvious static obstacles immediately block movement to the right, which ACTION4 attempts. Since ACTION3 was successful moving the block from (28,30) to (28,28) in the immediate last turn, we have reason to believe the current position does not universally block lateral moves."
