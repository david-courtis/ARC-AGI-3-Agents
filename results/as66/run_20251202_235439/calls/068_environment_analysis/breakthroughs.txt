1. Confirmed that when ACTION1 does NOT move the Movable Block (Player), it causes a Dynamic Side Boundary (Right, Color 14, 4x48) to DISAPPEAR, and a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4) to APPEAR. This strengthens the understanding of conditional action outcomes and interconnected environment dynamics.
2. Confirmed that when the Movable Block (Player) does NOT move after ACTION1, the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) AND the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) both move to the RIGHT. This is a new, conditional movement pattern for these secondary objects, as previous similar scenarios showed them moving left with a blocked ACTION1. This implies their movement direction with a blocked ACTION1 depends on which dynamic boundary is currently present.
