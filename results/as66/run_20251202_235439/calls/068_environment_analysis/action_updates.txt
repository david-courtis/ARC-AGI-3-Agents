ACTION1: ACTION1 attempts to move the movable block two units upwards. If successful, it moves two units upwards, causes a dynamic bottom boundary (Color 14) to DISAPPEAR, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to APPEAR. This action also causes other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block to move two units to the LEFT. If the movable block IS obstructed from moving upwards, it does NOT move; instead, other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) move two units to the RIGHT. Additionally, if blocked, a dynamic side boundary (Right) DISAPPEARS and a dynamic top boundary APPEARS. The movable block's color and shape are not changed by this action.
  Reason: The current observation shows a blocked ACTION1 where the player block did not move, but the 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' moved to the right, and the dynamic right boundary disappeared while a dynamic top boundary appeared. This is a new, specific conditional outcome for a blocked ACTION1.
