This action also causes other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block to move two units to the LEFT. If the movable block IS obstructed from moving upwards, it does NOT move; instead, other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) move two units to the RIGHT. Additionally, if blocked, a dynamic side boundary (Right) DISAPPEARS and a dynamic top boundary APPEARS. The movable block's color and shape are not changed by this action.",
