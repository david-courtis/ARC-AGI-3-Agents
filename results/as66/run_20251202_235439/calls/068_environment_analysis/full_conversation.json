BOUNDARIES/WALLS - Where can entities NOT move? What stops movement?\n2. BACKGROUND - What is the base color/pattern? What areas are \"empty\"?\n3. OBJECTS - What distinct objects exist? What are their visual properties?\n4. OBJECT ROLES - Are some objects \"players\"? \"Goals\"? \"Obstacles\"? \"Collectibles\"?\n5. SPATIAL STRUCTURE - Is there a grid? Rooms? Paths? Corridors?\n6. INTERACTABLES - What objects can be interacted with? How do you know?\n7. UI ELEMENTS - Look for move counters, score displays, progress indicators!\n\nCRITICAL: Look for WALLS and BOUNDARIES!\n- If an object tried to move but couldn't, WHY?\n- Is there a border around the play area?\n- Are there internal walls or obstacles blocking movement?\n- What color/pattern indicates a wall vs empty space?\n\nIMPORTANT: UI ELEMENTS AND MOVE COUNTERS!\n- There are likely UI elements (dots, squares, lines) that track the number of SUCCESSFUL moves\n- These counters typically decrease or change with each move that has an EFFECT\n- When the counter runs out (e.g., all dots disappear), the game will FAIL and force a RESET\n- Look for patterns at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen that seem separate from the play area\n- Red dots, grey lines, or colored squares often serve as move/turn indicators\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:\n- Only make claims you have EVIDENCE for from observed state changes\n- If you're guessing without evidence, explicitly mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- When an action causes a state change, that's EVIDENCE - use it to confirm or refute hypotheses\n- No-effect actions also provide evidence about boundaries and constraints\n\nBe a detective.

The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides. A dynamic top boundary can also appear. New UI elements appear on the left outside the main play area.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: The above understanding is TENTATIVE and based on limited observations.\nIf the action results CONTRADICT this understanding, you MUST update it!\nYou can REPLACE objects_identified entirely if the current list is wrong.\n\nPREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS:\n- Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.\n- Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.\n- Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).\n- Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.\n- Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.\n- Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).\n- Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).\n- Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.\n- Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.\n- Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.\n- Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.\n- Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.\n- ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.\n- Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).\n- Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.\n- Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.\n- Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.\n- Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.\n- The movable block (player) changed shape from a 4x4 block to a C-shaped block (Color 8) and appeared at a new position (48,12) as a result of ACTION2.\n- ACTION2 caused the disappearance of a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0), suggesting it was a consumable or temporary obstacle/element.\n- The outermost top-left border area, previously light pink (Color 13), changed to a different color (Color 11) with ACTION2. This indicates dynamic behavior even in the outermost border/UI elements, possibly a feedback mechanism.\n- The movable player block, previously identified as black, is now described as Color 11, and the current state shows a Color 8 black C-shaped block. This indicates the player block can change color and shape based on actions. This observation resolves a discrepancy from a previous analysis's description of ACTION4 (which stated Color 11 for the player block that moved left), and this current frame shows a black (Color 8) player block.\n- Explicit identification of new UI elements appearing: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40). These are outside the main play area, suggesting they are UI or game state indicators, possibly related to moves or progress.\n- The movable block moved left by four units as a result of ACTION4, providing more specific movement distance for this action.\n- The movable block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28,28) to (28,30).\n- Discrepancy resolved: The player block's previous description of 'Color 11' from ACTION4 analysis was likely a temporary state or error; its current observable state and previous ACTION2 state is Color 8 C-shaped, and this action's effect confirms a Color 11 rectangular block. This suggests the player block can change both shape and color depending on the action or state.\n- The movable player block's color changed from 'Color 8 (black)' to 'Color 11 (light gray)' and its shape changed from 'C-shaped' to 'rectangular block (4x4)' as a result of ACTION4. This strongly reinforces the idea that the player entity can dynamically change both its form and color.\n- ACTION4 caused the previous dynamic right boundary to disappear and a new dynamic left boundary to appear at (8,56). This provides further evidence that the dynamic side boundaries effectively shift the active horizontal play area by appearing and disappearing on opposite sides.\n- Confirmed the movable block can move two units downwards as demonstrated by ACTION2.\n- The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) was expected to move up with ACTION1, but instead, it did NOT move. This means its movement is blocked by an invisible element or new constraints. This contradicts the previous understanding that ACTION1 always moves the block up.\n- ACTION1 now has varied outcomes; it can either move the player block up (as in a previous observation) or, if blocked, it can cause other objects to move and trigger dynamic boundary changes. This indicates a conditional action or a more complex game state interaction for ACTION1.\n- A previously identified Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) DISAPPEARED in this action.\n- A Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) APPEARED in this action. This further solidifies the concept of dynamic boundaries controlling the available play space.\n- Two new movable objects were confirmed: a Color 12 irregular shape (12x12) and a Color 13 (light pink) rectangular block (4x4), both of which moved right in this action. These are distinct interactive elements within the game world.\n- Identified a new object: a Cyan block (Color 14) positioned to the upper left of the playing area, obscuring part of the Red background. This is a newly seen object or part of an existing dynamic structure.\n- Refined understanding of the movable block's properties: The movable block (player) is a Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, moving two units to the right as a result of ACTION4. This clarifies previous ambiguous color/shape descriptions and confirms its current form upon successful ACTION4 execution.\n- The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) at (24,24) did NOT move up with ACTION1. This confirms that ACTION1's effect of moving the player block up is conditional and can be blocked.\n- ACTION1, when blocked for the main player, now explicitly triggers the movement of the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) AND the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to the left by two units. This confirms these other objects are interactable and their movement is tied to the main player's failed ACTION1.\n- This instance of ACTION1 also caused a Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) to DISAPPEAR, and a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) to APPEAR. This further reinforces the complex, conditional nature of ACTION1 and the dynamic environment elements.\n- The Color 14 Cyan block newly identified in the upper left (previously 'Cyan Block (Upper Left)' in object_identified) is now part of the Dynamic Top Boundary (48x4 at (4,8)) that appeared. It is not a separate object but rather part of the dynamic boundary system.\n- Confirmed current state of the Movable Block (Player) as Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, moving two units down as a direct result of ACTION2.\n- ACTION2 causes the disappearance of a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) and the appearance of a Dynamic Side Boundary (Right, Color 14, 4x48 at (56,8)). This reinforces the idea that dynamic boundaries are intrinsically linked to actions and can shift across the entire play area, not just move left/right or top/bottom in isolation for an action, but convert between types (top to right).\n- ACTION1 moves the movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block two units upwards.\n- ACTION1 causes the Dynamic Side Boundary (Right, Color 14, 4x48) to DISAPPEAR.\n- ACTION1 causes a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4) to APPEAR at (4,8).\n- ACTION1 causes the Moving Irregular Block (Color 12) and Moving Rectangular Block (Color 13) to move left by an unknown amount (implied by previous observation of movement to the left and this action moving them left).\n- ACTION3 had no effect on the Movable Block (Player) at (24,24), despite previous observations of it moving left with ACTION3. This indicates a new positional or environmental constraint blocking leftward movement at this specific location, even if no visible obstacle appears to be directly in the way.\n- ACTION3 caused the disappearance of a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4) at (4,8) and the appearance of a Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48) at (8,4). This confirms the linked nature of dynamic boundary shifts even when the main player block does not move with ACTION3.\n- ACTION3 caused the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) to move left and the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to move right, demonstrating that these objects can respond to ACTION3 even when the player block is blocked. This reveals their independent nature and their varied responses to the same action.\n- Confirmed the movable block can move two units to the right as observed by ACTION4.\n- Confirmed that ACTION4 causes the current dynamic left boundary to disappear (4x48 at (8,4)) and a new dynamic right boundary to appear (4x48 at (8,56)).\n- Confirmed that both the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) move right in response to ACTION4 when the player also moves right. This reinforces their independent but interactive nature.\n- ACTION4 explicitly moved the Movable Block (Player) two units to the right from (24,24) to (24,26).\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:\n- What triggers the appearance/disappearance of the dynamic boundaries? Is it specific to movement direction, position, or an internal game state?\n- What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?\n- What happens when the movable block interacts with the green 'landmass'?\n- What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?\n- Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?\n- What is the exact mechanism causing the outermost top-left border area to change color (Color 13 to Color 11) and what does this color change signify?\n- What is the significance of the grey block (Color 12) disappearing as a consequence of ACTION2?\n- What is the role of the newly appeared Color 13 and Color 12 UI elements and how do they relate to game state?\n- What specific element or state blocked the player's leftward movement during ACTION3 at position (24,24)?\n\nCURRENT ACTION DEFINITIONS (ALSO TENTATIVE):\n  ACTION1: \"ACTION1 attempts to move the movable block two units upwards. If the movable block IS NOT obstructed, it moves two units upwards, causes a dynamic bottom boundary (Color 14) to DISAPPEAR, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to APPEAR. This action also causes other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block to move two units to the LEFT. If the movable block IS obstructed from moving upwards, it does NOT move; instead, other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape or Color 13 rectangular block) may move either two units to the RIGHT or two units to the LEFT, and dynamic side boundaries (left or right) may disappear while a dynamic top boundary appears. The specific direction of movement for the other objects (left or right) when the main block is blocked appears to depend on which side boundary is present (left or right). This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.\"\n  ACTION2: \"ACTION2 moves the primary movable block two units down. If successful, it causes the dynamic top border (if present) to disappear and a new dynamic right border (Color 14, 4x48, at (56,8)) to appear. It also moves the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to the left by two units.\"\n  ACTION3: \"ACTION3 attempts to move the movable block two units to the left. If the movable block is NOT obstructed, it moves two units to the left, (causes the dynamic top border to disappear and a new dynamic left border to appear, and moves the 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' to the left by two units). If the player block IS obstructed, it does NOT move, but it still triggers the disappearance of the Dynamic Top Boundary and the appearance of the Dynamic Side Boundary (Left). It also causes the 'Moving Irregular Block' to move left and the 'Moving Rectangular Block' to move right. The movable block does not change its appearance.\"\n  ACTION4: \"ACTION4 moves the movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block two units to the right. It causes the existing dynamic left boundary (Color 14, 4x48) to disappear, and a new dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) to appear. Other independent elements, the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13), also move two units to the right. This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.\"\n  ACTION5: \"ACTION5 attempts to move the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action is blocked if a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present.\"\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS TASKS:\n1. LOOK FOR WALLS/BOUNDARIES - If movement failed, identify what blocked it!\n2. What color is the BACKGROUND (empty space)?\n3. What distinct OBJECTS exist? What might their ROLES be?\n4. Are there patterns in the spatial layout?\n5. What movement CONSTRAINTS can you infer?\n6. LOOK FOR MOVE COUNTERS/UI ELEMENTS - Are there dots, squares, or lines that track moves?\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED REASONING:\n- State changes are EVIDENCE. Use them to CONFIRM or REFUTE hypotheses.\n- No-effect actions are EVIDENCE of boundaries, walls, or constraints.\n- If you have NO EVIDENCE for a claim, mark it as \"UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS\"\n- Don't make uneducated guesses - only claim what you can support with evidence\n- If previous understanding was based on guessing and now contradicted by evidence, CORRECT IT\n\nUPDATING THE ENVIRONMENT MODEL:\n- Your objects_identified list REPLACES the previous one - include all objects you're confident about\n- If you now think an object has a different role, update the role_hypothesis\n- Add evidence_for_role explaining WHY you think an object has that role\n- If you realize a previous identification was WRONG, simply don't include it (or include corrected version)\n\nMake BREAKTHROUGHS! If you discover something new and significant, list it.\nIf previous understanding was WRONG, note the CORRECTION as a breakthrough.\n\nACTION DEFINITION UPDATES (BE VERY CONSERVATIVE):\nOnly suggest updates to action definitions if you have a DRASTIC new insight that fundamentally\nchanges the understanding of what the action does. Default to NOT suggesting updates.\n\nONLY suggest an update if:\n1. The current definition is completely WRONG or MISSING critical information\n2. You discovered something that CONTRADICTS the current definition\n3. You have HIGH CONFIDENCE based on EVIDENCE (not guessing)\n\nDefault: Leave suggested_action_updates as an EMPTY array unless truly necessary."
