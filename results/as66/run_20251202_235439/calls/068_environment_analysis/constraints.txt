- The movable block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).
- Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).
- The movable block can move left (as seen with ACTION3 and ACTION4).
- Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner static Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.
- The movable block can move right (as seen with ACTION4 and ACTION3 observation).
- The movable block is blocked from moving right by a dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48).
- The movable block can move upwards (as seen with ACTION1 in previous observations).
- The movable block's upward movement (ACTION1) can be blocked by an unknown element/constraint, causing other objects to move and different boundary changes to occur. This is evidenced by the current observation where the player block did not move.
- The movable block (Player) is currently at (24,24) and ACTION3 had no effect, indicating its movement to the left was blocked in this specific instance. This implies a new or temporary constraint at this position.
