The Color 13 rectangular block (4x4) that was at (12,28) moved two units to the left to (12,26).

This action causes an existing dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) to disappear and a new dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) to appear. Alternatively, if a dynamic left boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present, it will disappear, and a new dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) will appear. This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.",

The Green 'Landmass' (Color 4: 8x8 shape at (20,32)) was directly beside the movable block at (24,32), acting as an obstacle and preventing its rightward movement. In this specific situation, where the main block is blocked, the 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' still moved two units to the left, which contradicts previous observations where they moved right when the main block was blocked by an obstacle. The dynamic top border was present, leading to its disappearance and the appearance of the dynamic right border.",
