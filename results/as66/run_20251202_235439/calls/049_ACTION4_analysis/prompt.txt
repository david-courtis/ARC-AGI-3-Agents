Analyze the effect of action ACTION4.

YOUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF ACTION4:
"ACTION4 moves the movable block two units to the left. This action also causes the dynamic left-side Color 14 block to disappear and a new dynamic right-side Color 14 block to appear. New UI elements, a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40), appeared on the left side of the screen at the same time as the action. The movable block changes its appearance to a Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block if it was previously in another form (e.g., C-shaped)."

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS (3 total):
  [1] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game state contained a movable 4x4 black block at (28,24) and a dynamic Color 14 boundary on the left side of the play area at (8,4).
      Interpretation: The 4x4 black block at (28, 24) moved two units to the right, from column 24 to column 26. The dynamic color 14 block (4x48) that was at (8,4) disappeared, and a new dynamic color 14 block (4x48) appeared on the right side of the play area at (8,56).
  [2] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: The game state contained a movable 4x4 block at (28,44) and a dynamic Color 14 boundary on the left side of the play area (8,4). No obstacles blocked the block's movement to the left. The movable block was identified as Color 11 (light gray), not black (Color 8) as previously assumed, and also not a C-shape.
      Interpretation: The movable block at (28, 44) (previously described as black, now identified as Color 11) moved four units to the left, from column 44 to column 40. The dynamic Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) that was at (8,4) disappeared (it was on the left side of the screen), and a new Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) appeared on the right side of the play area at (8,56). Two new objects appeared in the UI area: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0,24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0,40).
  [3] HAD EFFECT (NEW INFO)
      Context: A movable 4x4 Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block was at (28,40). A dynamic Color 14 border (left) was present at (8,4). No obstacles were directly to the left of the movable block.
      Interpretation: The movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, currently at (28,40), moved two units to the left, from column 40 to column 38. The dynamic Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) that was at (8,4) disappeared (left border), and a new Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) appeared on the right side of the play area at (8,56).

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)

BORDER: Yes (Multiple (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink, magenta))
  Description: The outermost boundary is a single pixel thick: Color 3 (green) on top, left, and right, and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside the green top, left, and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with Color 10 (light blue) outermost and Color 14 (dark blue) inner. At the bottom, inside the green border, there's a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and below that a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). A 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar is at the very left edge (8,0). Dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) blocks appear and disappear on the left, right, and top sides, changing the horizontal and vertical confines of the play area. A magenta (Color 5) single pixel line is on the very top, acting as a UI element.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides. A dynamic top boundary can also appear. The outermost top-left border area changed color, indicating a potentially dynamic UI or border element within the outermost frame. New UI elements appear on the left outside the main play area.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.
  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.
  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).
  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.
  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.
  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).
  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).
  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.
  - Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.
  - Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.
  - Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.
  - Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.
  - ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.
  - Confirmed the movable black block can move upwards, as observed by ACTION1, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (26, 40).
  - Identified a new type of dynamic boundary: a Color 14 (dark blue) rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) as a dynamic top boundary when ACTION1 was executed. This shows not just side boundaries, but also top dynamic boundaries can appear.
  - Correction to previous understanding: The 'Changing Block' at (4,8) that was observed in ACTION2 as Color 14 changing to Color 12, was actually part of a dynamic boundary element itself. The appearance of a 48x4 Color 14 block at (4,8) in this action (ACTION1 EFFECT) suggests the role of this area is consistently related to dynamic boundary changes, rather than a standalone interactive block. Its previous change might have been an intermediate state or removal as part of a dynamic boundary shift, rather than an independent object changing color.
  - Confirmed the specific element blocking ACTION5: The absence of movement after ACTION5, combined with the presence of the 4x48 Color 14 dynamic right boundary block, strongly suggests this dynamic boundary is actively blocking the movable block's rightward movement. This refutes the 'green landmass' hypothesis for this specific action's blockage, though the green landmasses may be obstacles in other scenarios.
  - Refined understanding of ACTION5: It attempts to move the movable block right by two units but is currently blocked by the dynamic right boundary.
  - The movable block (player) changed shape from a 4x4 block to a C-shaped block (Color 8) and appeared at a new position (48,12) as a result of ACTION2.
  - ACTION2 caused the disappearance of a grey block (Color 12, 1x31) at (32,0), suggesting it was a consumable or temporary obstacle/element.
  - The outermost top-left border area, previously light pink (Color 13), changed to a different color (Color 11) with ACTION2. This indicates dynamic behavior even in the outermost border/UI elements, possibly a feedback mechanism.
  - The movable player block, previously identified as black, is now described as Color 11, and the current state shows a Color 8 black C-shaped block. This indicates the player block can change color and shape based on actions. This observation resolves a discrepancy from a previous analysis's description of ACTION4 (which stated Color 11 for the player block that moved left), and this current frame shows a black (Color 8) player block.
  - Explicit identification of new UI elements appearing: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40). These are outside the main play area, suggesting they are UI or game state indicators, possibly related to moves or progress.
  - The movable block moved left by four units as a result of ACTION4, providing more specific movement distance for this action.
  - The movable block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28,28) to (28,30).
  - Discrepancy resolved: The player block's previous description of 'Color 11' from ACTION4 analysis was likely a temporary state or error; its current observable state and previous ACTION2 state is Color 8 C-shaped, and this action's effect confirms a Color 11 rectangular block. This suggests the player block can change both shape and color depending on the action or state.
  - The movable player block's color changed from 'Color 8 (black)' to 'Color 11 (light gray)' and its shape changed from 'C-shaped' to 'rectangular block (4x4)' as a result of ACTION4. This strongly reinforces the idea that the player entity can dynamically change both its form and color.
  - ACTION4 caused the previous dynamic right boundary to disappear and a new dynamic left boundary to appear at (8,56). This provides further evidence that the dynamic side boundaries effectively shift the active horizontal play area by appearing and disappearing on opposite sides.
  - Confirmed the movable block can move two units downwards as demonstrated by ACTION2.
  - The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) was expected to move up with ACTION1, but instead, it did NOT move. This means its movement is blocked by an invisible element or new constraints. This contradicts the previous understanding that ACTION1 always moves the block up.
  - ACTION1 now has varied outcomes; it can either move the player block up (as in a previous observation) or, if blocked, it can cause other objects to move and trigger dynamic boundary changes. This indicates a conditional action or a more complex game state interaction for ACTION1.
  - A previously identified Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) DISAPPEARED in this action.
  - A Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) APPEARED in this action. This further solidifies the concept of dynamic boundaries controlling the available play space.
  - Two new movable objects were confirmed: a Color 12 irregular shape (12x12) and a Color 13 (light pink) rectangular block (4x4), both of which moved right in this action. These are distinct interactive elements within the game world.
  - Identified a new object: a Cyan block (Color 14) positioned to the upper left of the playing area, obscuring part of the Red background. This is a newly seen object or part of an existing dynamic structure.

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION2 can cause a dynamic right border to disappear and a dynamic bottom border (Color 14, 48x4, at (56,8)) to appear.
  - The movement distance for ACTION2 is not always 4 units; it can be 2 units.
  - Movable block (player) movement can be prevented by green 'landmass' objects directly above it.
  - If the movable block is obstructed from moving upwards by ACTION1, a different game effect is triggered: a Color 12 irregular shape and a Color 13 rectangular block both move two units to the right.
  - The dynamic border changes associated with ACTION1 (left to top border) can occur even if the movable block's primary movement is blocked.
