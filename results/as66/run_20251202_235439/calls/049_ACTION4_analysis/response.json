  "interpretation": "The movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, previously at (24,24), moved two units to the right, landing at (24,26). The Color 12 irregular shape (12x12) that was at (8,20) moved two units to the right to (8,22). The Color 13 rectangular block (4x4) that was at (12,28) moved two units to the right to (12,30). The dynamic top border (Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4,8)) disappeared, and a new dynamic right border (Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8,56)) appeared.",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION4, when the movable block is not fully obstructed, typically moves the movable block two units to the right. Additionally, this action consistently causes the existing dynamic top border (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) to disappear, and a new dynamic right border (Color 14, 4x48 at (8,56)) to appear. If the movable block's primary movement is successful, other objects (specifically Color 12 irregular shapes and Color 13 rectangular blocks) that are within a certain proximity to the movable block also move two units to the right. The movable block does not change color or shape during this action. The UI elements (Color 13 rectangular block at (0,24) and Color 12 irregular shape at (0,40)) observed in a previous instance seem to be a global state change, not directly tied to individual ACTION4 calls, or they appeared only once during the game's progression.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": false,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable Color 11 (light gray) block was at (24,24). There was no immediate obstruction to its right, allowing it to move two units. The presence of the dynamic top border enabled its disappearance and the corresponding appearance of the dynamic right border. The other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) were at (8,20) and (12,28) respectively, and moved along with the main block, indicating they are part of a 'group movement' triggered by this action. This contradicts previous observations of ACTION4 where it moved the block two or four units to the LEFT, and had different UI objects appearing. It also clarifies previous assumptions about the block's color/shape change being tied to ACTION4; it appears that the block does NOT change color or shape with ACTION4.",
