  "current_board_assessment": "The current board shows a character (black pixels) at the bottom-center. There are green irregularly shaped objects and an orange pixel in the top half. The borders are light blue, with a pink strip at the top and a yellow strip at the bottom. This looks like a simple 2D game environment."
