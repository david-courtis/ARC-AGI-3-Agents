  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has no observations yet, making it the highest priority for testing. The current state is dynamic regarding side boundaries, so testing rightward movement is important to understand its interaction with the new left dynamic boundary and to see if a new right boundary appears. We prioritize actions with zero observations before re-testing actions that have already been attempted, even if they were 'no effect'.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Discover the effect of ACTION4 (Move RIGHT) on the movable block and its interaction with the environment, especially any dynamic boundaries. We want to see if it moves the block, how many units, and if it triggers any environmental changes or block appearances.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable block is currently positioned to the left side of the playable area, which provides a good opportunity to test rightward movement. There is a dynamic left boundary present, which might interact with rightward movement. There's no immediately apparent right boundary (other than the static border layers), so we can observe if ACTION4 creates one or if the block approaches the static border."
