      "Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).",
      "Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic."

      "What triggers the color change of the block at (4,8) (now absent)? Was it specific to position or type of movement?",
      "What is the exact role of the appearing dynamic Color 14 side blocks? Are they always exclusionary boundaries or can the player interact with them?",
      "What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?",
      "What happens when the movable block interacts with the green 'landmasses' or the orange collectible?",
      "What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?",
      "Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?"
