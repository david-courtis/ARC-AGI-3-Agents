  "interpretation": "The movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block, currently at (24,24), moved two units down to (26,24). The Color 12 irregular shape (12x12) that was at (8,24) moved two units left to (8,22). The Color 13 rectangular block (4x4) that was at (12,24) moved two units left to (12,22). The dynamic top border (Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4,8)) disappeared, and a new dynamic bottom border (Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8)) appeared. Notably, the C-shaped block observed in previous ACTION2 analyses (Legacy Objects) is not present here; the movable block is a Color 11 rectangular block.",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION2 attempts to move the primary movable block two units down. If successful, it causes the dynamic top border (if present) to disappear and a new dynamic bottom border (Color 14, 48x4, at (56,8)) to appear. In some contexts, it can also cause other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) to move two units to the left. Previous observations suggest that the movable block might change shape and color (e.g., from a rectangular block to a C-shaped block) and disappear/reappear at a new location with this action, or cause other objects to disappear and appear, but this observation indicates a simpler downward movement and a shift in dynamic borders.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": false,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block was at (24,24) and had no immediate visible obstacles two units directly below it, allowing it to move downward. The presence of the dynamic top border (Color 14 rectangular block (48x4)) enabled its disappearance and the corresponding appearance of the dynamic bottom border. The other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) were at (8,24) and (12,24) respectively, and moved along with the main block, indicating they are part of a 'group movement' or are triggered to move by this action. The absence of the C-shaped block transformation suggests that this is a more 'standard' movement of the current player block (Color 11 rectangular).",
