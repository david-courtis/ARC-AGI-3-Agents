ACTION1: ACTION1 attempts to move the movable block two units upwards. If the movable block is obstructed, it does NOT move; instead, other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block move two units to the LEFT. This obstructed scenario also causes specific dynamic boundary changes, including the disappearance of a dynamic left boundary (Color 14) and the appearance of a dynamic top boundary (Color 14). If not obstructed, it moves the movable block two units upwards, causing a dynamic right boundary (Color 14) to disappear and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to appear. This action does not appear to change the movable block's color or shape.
  Reason: The current observation explicitly showed ACTION1 failing to move the player block, and instead caused other specified objects to move left and dynamic boundaries to shift in a distinct way. This refines the conditional behavior of ACTION1.
