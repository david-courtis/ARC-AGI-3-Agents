1. The movable player block, Color 11 (light gray) at (24,24) did NOT move up with ACTION1. This confirms that ACTION1's effect of moving the player block up is conditional and can be blocked.
2. ACTION1, when blocked for the main player, now explicitly triggers the movement of the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) AND the 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) to the left by two units. This confirms these other objects are interactable and their movement is tied to the main player's failed ACTION1.
3. This instance of ACTION1 also caused a Dynamic Side Boundary (Left, Color 14, 4x48 at (8,4)) to DISAPPEAR, and a Dynamic Top Boundary (Color 14, 48x4 at (4,8)) to APPEAR. This further reinforces the complex, conditional nature of ACTION1 and the dynamic environment elements.
4. The Color 14 Cyan block newly identified in the upper left (previously 'Cyan Block (Upper Left)' in object_identified) is now part of the Dynamic Top Boundary (48x4 at (4,8)) that appeared. It is not a separate object but rather part of the dynamic boundary system.
