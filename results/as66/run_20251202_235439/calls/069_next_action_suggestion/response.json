  "target_action": "ACTION4",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION4 has not been verified yet and has fewer attempts (5/8) than ACTION1 and ACTION2 (both 7/8 and 4/8 respectively). Also, recent observations suggest predictable behavior for ACTION4 (moves block right, shifts dynamic boundaries). The current position of the Movable block (Player) at (24,32) is not adjacent to any obvious green 'landmass' or static obstacle to its right that would block ACTION4, so it's a good state to test its effect. Additionally, since the 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' have shown varied responses to actions, testing ACTION4 could help clarify their movement patterns when the main block moves predictably.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe the Movable Block (Player) move two units to the right, the dynamic left boundary (if present) disappear, and a new dynamic right boundary to appear. We also expect to confirm the movement direction (right) and distance for the 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' in response to a successful ACTION4. This will contribute to verifying ACTION4 and understanding the interaction of these independent elements.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The Movable Block (Player) is a black (Color 8) C-shaped block currently at (24,32). There is a dynamic left boundary (Color 14, 4x48) at (8,4). There appears to be sufficient space to the right for the block to move. The 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' are present and in a state where their movement could be observed in response to ACTION4."
