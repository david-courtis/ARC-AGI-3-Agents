  "reasoning": "ACTION1 has had two recent no-effect attempts from a previous position. According to the rules, we must use a setup sequence to move to a different position before retrying a no-effect action. ACTION5 is verified for movement (rightward), but it is currently blocked by a dynamic right border. On the other hand, ACTION3 is partially understood to move the movable block to the right and also causes dynamic side boundaries to shift. This is ideal for a setup sequence since its movement is consistent (2 units right) and it can also clear the right boundary, potentially enabling ACTION5 in the future. By moving the block twice to the right using ACTION3, we ensure a significant change in position and might also observe more about the dynamic boundaries. After moving, we will re-test ACTION1 to try and gain consistent observations for its effects.",
  "expected_information_gain": "Testing ACTION1 from a new position will provide more observations to verify its definition and understand under what conditions it causes no effect. The setup sequence using ACTION3 will provide more observations for ACTION3 and its interaction with dynamic boundaries, potentially leading to its verification.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable block is currently (Color 11, 4x4) at (28,34). The current state includes a dynamic left boundary at (8,56) and a dynamic right boundary at (56,8). Multiple green 'landmass' obstacles and a light pink bottom border are present. ACTION5 is currently blocked on the right due to the dynamic boundary. ACTION1 has shown no effect recently."
