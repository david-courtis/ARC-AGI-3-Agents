ACTION3: ACTION3 moves the movable block two units to the right. It causes the dynamic Color 14 block on the right side to disappear and a new dynamic Color 14 block (4x48) to appear on the left side, shifting the horizontal play area. The movable block also changes its appearance to a Color 11 rectangular block if it was previously in another form (e.g., C-shaped).
  Reason: Previous observations confirm the two-unit right movement and the dynamic boundary shift from right to left. The change of the movable block to a Color 11 rectangular block is a consistent part of this action now.

ACTION4: ACTION4 moves the movable block two units to the left. This action also causes the dynamic left-side Color 14 block to disappear and a new dynamic right-side Color 14 block to appear. New UI elements, a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40), appeared on the left side of the screen at the same time as the action. The movable block changes its appearance to a Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block if it was previously in another form (e.g., C-shaped).
  Reason: The movable block's color and shape change to Color 11 rectangular block is consistently observed with ACTION4. Also, the dynamic boundary shift from left to right is now clearer based on the current action's evidence.
