  "reasoning": "ACTION5 has had three consecutive 'no effect' attempts, indicating the movable block is blocked. The observation suggests it's blocked by the dynamic right boundary (Color 14). To properly test ACTION5 further and potentially get a different result, we need to move the movable block away from the right boundary. ACTION3 (move LEFT) is a good candidate for this. Since we need to move 'twice' as ACTION3 moves the block by 2 units, and we want to move it significantly away to give ACTION5 a chance. By moving left twice, we remove the block from the right boundary, and also remove the right dynamic border, and create a left dynamic border. This gives ACTION5 a new context. Then, if ACTION5 still results in 'no effect', we can further investigate why. Moving left twice should give ACTION5 enough room. All actions are pending, so we are choosing one that has been continuously blocked to try and get it out of its blocked state.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to observe a non-'no effect' outcome for ACTION5 by moving the movable block to a new position. Specifically, we want to see if ACTION5 is now able to move the block to the right after the setup sequence has removed the right boundary and created an open space. This will validate or refute the hypothesis that the dynamic right boundary is the sole cause of ACTION5's previous 'no effect' attempts. We also expect to obtain more consistent observations for ACTION3.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable 4x4 black block is currently located at (32,40). There is a dynamic right boundary (Color 14) that appears to be blocking ACTION5. There are no other immediate obstacles to the left of the block. The current position is not ideal for testing ACTION5 without a setup sequence."
