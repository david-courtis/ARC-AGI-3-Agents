  "reasoning": "ACTION1 had no effect in the previous state. According to the critical rules, we must first use a setup sequence to move to a different position before re-testing an action that had no effect. ACTION4 is chosen for the setup sequence because we have recent observations of it moving the block to the right and influencing the dynamic side boundaries, which will create a different environment for observing the effects of ACTION1. This will move the block further away from the green 'landmass' and the orange object, giving ACTION1 a clearer path to potentially move upwards, or at least a new context for observation. Both ACTION1 and ACTION5 need further testing, and ACTION1 has had more failed attempts.",
  "expected_information_gain": "By testing ACTION1 from a new position, we aim to observe if its effect is context-dependent, specifically if it can move the player block upwards when not blocked by the green 'landmass', or if it has another subtle effect within a different boundary configuration. We are trying to find where ACTION1 is blocked, or if it is a null action unless specific conditions are met.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The movable black block is currently situated such that attempting ACTION1 would likely result in it being blocked by the green 'landmass' above it. ACTION5 also had no effect recently, and its blockage is hypothesised to be due to boundaries or obstacles. Moving the block to a new position using ACTION4 will provide a fresh context for testing ACTION1 and help determine if its 'no effect' status is due to environmental constraints or a properties of the action itself."
