Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 1/3 consistent, 2/8 attempts | Def: ACTION1 seems to be an action that does not always have a visible effect. Further observations are required to determine its specific function or target.
  ACTION2: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the 4x4 color 8 block four units down, causes a color change of the block at (4,8) from color 14 to color 12, and triggers the appearance of a dynamic Color 14 block (48x4) at (56,8) which appears to be a dynamic right border. The small 13x1 color 13 block at (0,25) was likely a misinterpretation of the appearance of the dynamic side boundary.
  ACTION3: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Moves the movable block 2 units to the left. Causes the dynamic Color 14 block previously on the right side to disappear and a new dynamic Color 14 block (4x48) to appear on the left side, shifting the horizontal play area. Also causes the disappearance of the 'changing block' at (4,8).
  ACTION4: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: ACTION4 moves the movable 4x4 black block two units to the right. This action also causes the dynamic left-side Color 14 block to disappear and a new dynamic right-side Color 14 block to appear.
  ACTION5: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Color 6 (dark red)

BORDER: Yes (Multiple colors (green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, light pink, magenta))
  Description: The outermost boundary is a single pixel thick: Color 3 (green) on top, left, and right, and Color 2 (yellow) at the very bottom. Inside the green top, left, and right, there's a two-pixel thick border, with Color 10 (light blue) outermost and Color 14 (dark blue) inner. At the bottom, inside the green border, there's a Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and below that a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1). A 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar is at the very left edge (8,0). Dynamic Color 14 (dark blue) blocks appear and disappear on the left and right sides, changing the horizontal confines of the play area. A magenta (Color 5) single pixel line is on the very top, acting as a UI element.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Grid-based play area enclosed by multi-layered borders. The primary play area is a large red rectangle, containing green 'landmasses'. There are distinct horizontal boundary lines at the bottom and dynamic vertical 'blocks' appearing on the sides.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed the 4x4 black block as a movable player/game piece due to observed movement by ACTION2.
  - Identified a 'Changing Block' (originally Color 14, now Color 12) at (4,8) which changes color as a result of ACTION2, suggesting an interactive element, switch, or counter.
  - Discovery of a complex, multi-layered border system including Color 10 (light blue), Color 14 (dark blue), Color 3 (green), Color 13 (light pink), Color 2 (yellow), and Color 5 (magenta).
  - Evidence that some border elements can 'appear' dynamically, specifically the Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) which strongly suggests the right border appeared as a consequence of ACTION2. This implies boundaries are not always static.
  - Refined understanding of the 'bottom' area, now identifying a distinct Color 13 (light pink) bar (48x1) and a Color 3 (green) bar (48x1) likely serving as a floor or critical boundary within the playable space.
  - Confirmed the movable block can move to the left, as observed by ACTION3, which moved the block from (28, 40) to (28, 38).
  - Observed the dynamic nature of side boundaries; ACTION3 caused the previously appeared Color 14 right boundary (48x4 at (56,8)) to disappear, and a new Color 14 left boundary (4x48 at (8,4)) to appear. This strongly suggests that these dynamic blocks define the current active play area limits horizontally and can shift with actions. This overturns the previous understanding that a Color 13 block was appearing at (0,25)  - it was actually this larger block. The (4,8) changing block is also no longer present, implying it was part of the dynamic structure or got consumed. (Correction to previous understanding: the 'changing block' at (4,8) that turned grey is no longer visible, potentially removed or part of the dynamic boundary that disappeared).
  - Identified a new persistent static element: a 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall Color 13 (light pink) bar located at the very left edge (8,0), inside the light blue border. This is a consistent static element of the environment, not dynamic.
  - Confirmed the movable black block can move two units to the right, as observed by ACTION4.
  - Further confirmation that the Color 14 side boundaries are truly dynamic; ACTION4 explicitly showed the left dynamic boundary disappearing and a new right dynamic boundary appearing, reinforcing the idea of a shifting horizontal play area.
  - Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.
  - Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.
  - ACTION1 not having a visible effect suggests it is either blocked, has a subtle effect not yet observed, or is simply a null action. The total number of pixels changed (397) and affected regions in both play area and UI suggest something did change, but perhaps not directly related to a 'move' of the main game piece, or it's a UI update.

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - The movable black block can move downwards (as seen with ACTION2).
  - Movement is constrained by outer borders (Color 3, 10, 14, 2, 13, 5).
  - The movable black block can move left (as seen with ACTION3).
  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.
  - Movement is confined within the bounds defined by the static inner Color 14 border and the dynamically appearing Color 14 side blocks.
  - The movable black block can move right (as seen with ACTION4).
  - Movement appears to be confined within the bounds defined by the inner static Color 14 border and dynamic side blocks.
  - The movable black block is blocked from moving in the direction intended by ACTION5. (UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS: could be blocked by the existing dynamic right boundary, or the green 'landmass' next to it.)

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role: Static obstacles or terrain elements)

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Playable Area Background: Color 6 (dark red) Large rectangular area (Role hypothesis: The main play area where game actions occur)
      Evidence: Covers the majority of the game screen and changes based on game actions.
  - Green 'Landmass' / Obstacle: Color 3 (green) Irregular clusters of squares (Role hypothesis: Static obstacles or terrain elements that block movement or define pathways.)
      Evidence: Present in multiple locations, does not move, and the player block has not been observed to move through it.
  - Movable Block: Color 8 (black) 4x4 rectangular block (Role hypothesis: Player-controlled block or interactive game piece)
      Evidence: Observed moving in response to ACTION2, ACTION3, and ACTION4.
  - Orange collectible/target: Color 4 (orange) Single square block (Role hypothesis: Collectible item or a target for the movable block)
      Evidence: Unique color and isolated placement suggests it might be a game objective.
  - UI element/Score indicator (magenta): Color 5 (magenta) Small rectangular bar (4x1) (Role hypothesis: UI Element, possibly a move counter or score)
      Evidence: Located at the very top, separate from the primary play area and shows changes in some frames.
  - Outer Top/Left/Right Border: Color 3 (green) Thin lines forming the outermost boundary (Role hypothesis: Outermost boundary of the game world, restricting movement beyond them.)
      Evidence: Forms the absolute edge of the observable game area.
  - Outer Bottom Border: Color 2 (yellow) Thin horizontal bar (64x1) (Role hypothesis: Outermost bottom boundary of the game world, definitively ending the play area downwards.)
      Evidence: Consistent static element at the very bottom, blocking downward movement beyond it.
  - Light Blue Border Layer: Color 10 (light blue) Thin lines, inner to the green border, outer to the dark blue border (Role hypothesis: Mid-layer of the play area border, further defining the playable space.)
      Evidence: Static visual element that encloses the dynamic play area.
  - Inner Dark Blue Border Layer (Static): Color 14 (dark blue) Thin lines, inner to the light blue border (Role hypothesis: Inner layer of the primary play area border, forming a static enclosure of the main gameplay within the dynamic boundaries.)
      Evidence: Consistent static boundary that encloses the main play space and dynamic side blocks.
  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (pink): Color 13 (light pink) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or critical boundary at the bottom of the play area, likely impassable.)
      Evidence: Static element at the bottom of the red play area, below which the player block has not moved.
  - Bottom Boundary/Floor (green): Color 3 (green) Rectangular bar (48x1) (Role hypothesis: Definite floor or boundary below the pink bar, likely impassable.)
      Evidence: Static element below the pink bar, acting as a further barrier.
  - Persistent Left Static Element: Color 13 (light pink) 1-pixel wide, 48-pixel tall bar (Role hypothesis: A static, fixed boundary or visual marker on the far left.)
      Evidence: Consistently present at (8,0), inside the light blue border, and does not move or change.
  - Dynamic Side Boundary: Color 14 (dark blue) Rectangular block (4x48) (Role hypothesis: A dynamic boundary that appears on either the left or right side, limiting the horizontal movement of the movable block.)
      Evidence: Observed appearing and disappearing on both left and right sides in response to player actions (ACTION3, ACTION4), defining the horizontal limits of the movable block's movement.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What specific element blocked ACTION5? Was it the dynamic right Color 14 boundary, the green 'landmass' adjacent to the black block, or something else?
  - What triggers the color change of the block at (4,8) (now absent)? Was it specific to position or type of movement?
  - What is the exact role of the appearing dynamic Color 14 side blocks beyond restricting movement? Are they interactable or triggers for other events?
  - What is the exact role of the Color 13 (light pink) bar and Color 3 (green) bar at the bottom? Are they an impassable floor, or can objects interact with them?
  - What happens when the movable block interacts with the orange collectible?
  - What is the function of the magenta (Color 5) bar at the top?
  - Is the Color 13 bar at (8,0) a permanent boundary, or can it be altered or moved later?
  - What caused the pixel changes in the UI and play area when ACTION1 had no visible effect on the primary game piece or overt borders?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 8 rectangular block (4x4): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (4, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 13 rectangular block (13x1): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) at (56, 8): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Movable Block (Color 8 rectangular block 4x4): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Appearing Right Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 48x4 at (56,8)): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Appearing Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION3 action
  - Dynamic Left Side Block (Color 14 rectangular block 4x48 at (8,4)): Involved in ACTION4 action
  - Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) at (8, 56): Involved in ACTION4 action

Recent Observations:
  - ACTION4 (Move Right) also controls the behavior of dynamic side border elements, similar to ACTION3 (Move Left). It causes the current dynamic side border to disappear and the opposite dynamic side border to appear.
  - The movement for horizontal actions (ACTION3 and ACTION4) appears to be consistently 2 units, contrary to the semantic hint of 'increase column/x'
  - The semantic hint 'Move RIGHT (increase column/x)' is confirmed in direction but not in magnitude (it is 2 units, not 1).
  - ACTION5, when applied in the current context, has no visible effect on the game state or any identified objects. This suggests it either modifies an unseen game state, requires a specific target or condition not met, or performs an action without a clear visual manifestation.
  - The green 'landmass' / obstacle (Color 3) blocks upward movement of the movable block.
