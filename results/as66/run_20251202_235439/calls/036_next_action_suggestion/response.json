  "reasoning": "ACTION5 is verified and ACTION1, ACTION2, and ACTION4 are still unverified and have shown highly contextual effects. ACTION3 needs more validation, and it was last observed to move the movable block two units to the left. The current state has the player block (C-shaped, black) near the left side but with space to move further left if the dynamic left border is removed. Testing ACTION3 now will help consolidate its definition and confirm if its effect of shifting the entire horizontal play area (dynamic side blocks) is consistent.",
  "expected_information_gain": "To get more consistent observations for ACTION3, specifically: 1. Confirm its movement distance to the left (2 units). 2. Confirm its effect on the dynamic side borders (left disappearing, right appearing). 3. Determine if the 'changing block' at (4,8) reappears or if its absence is permanent. 4. Observe if it has any other unexpected side effects in the current C-shaped state of the player.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The player-controlled block is currently a C-shaped black block at approximately (26,12). It is positioned such that there is space to move left, and a dynamic left border is present. This is a suitable state to test leftward movement with ACTION3."
