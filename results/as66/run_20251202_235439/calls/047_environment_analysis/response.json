    {
      "action_id": "ACTION1",

If the movable block is obstructed, it does NOT move; instead, other independent gameplay elements such as Color 12 irregular shapes and Color 13 rectangular blocks move two units to the right. This also causes specific dynamic boundary changes, including the disappearance of a dynamic left boundary (Color 14) and the appearance of a dynamic top boundary (Color 14).",
      "reasoning": "Previous understanding of ACTION1 was that it always moved the player block up. The current observation shows the player block did not move up and instead other objects moved and dynamic boundaries changed, indicating a conditional and more complex effect when the primary movement is blocked. The previous definition was incomplete."
