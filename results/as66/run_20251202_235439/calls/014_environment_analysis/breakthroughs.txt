1. Identified new movement constraint: ACTION5 had no visible effect, indicating the movable black block was blocked from moving. This is strong evidence of a boundary or internal obstacle preventing movement in the direction of ACTION5. The exact reason (dynamic border vs. internal obstacle) is still an open question.
2. Refined understanding of movement constraints to include explicit blockage by an unknown element/boundary for ACTION5.
