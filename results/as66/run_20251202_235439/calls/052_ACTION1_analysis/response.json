  "interpretation": "The movable 4x4 Color 11 (light gray) block at (24,24) did NOT move up. Instead, a Color 12 irregular shape (12x12) moved left from (8,28) to (8,26), and a Color 13 rectangular block (4x4) moved left from (12,28) to (12,26). The movable block (Color 11) remained at its original position of (24,24). The dynamic Color 14 rectangular block (4x48) that was at (8,4) (left side dynamic border) disappeared, and a new Color 14 rectangular block (48x4) appeared at (4,8) (top side dynamic border).",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION1 attempts to move the movable block two units upwards. If the movable block is obstructed, it does NOT move; instead, other independent gameplay elements such as Color 12 irregular shapes and Color 13 rectangular blocks move two units to the LEFT. This also causes specific dynamic boundary changes, including the disappearance of a dynamic left boundary (Color 14) and the appearance of a dynamic top boundary (Color 14). Otherwise, it moves the movable block two units upwards, causing a dynamic right boundary (Color 14) to disappear and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to appear. This action does not appear to change the movable block's color or shape.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block was at (24,24). Above it, partially overlapping at (20,20) and within a few units, was a green landmass object (Color 4: 8x12 shape at (20,20)). This green landmass appears to have obstructed its upward movement. This obstruction led to the secondary effect where other objects (the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) moved horizontally to the left, and the dynamic left border transformed into a dynamic top border. The movable block was at a position where other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape at (8,28) and Color 13 rectangular block at (12,28)) were present and could be affected to move left.",
