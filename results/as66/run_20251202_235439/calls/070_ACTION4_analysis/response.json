  "new_definition": "ACTION4 moves the movable Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block two units to the right, UNLESS its path is obstructed. If it is obstructed, the movable object does not move, but the 'Moving Irregular Block' (Color 12) and 'Moving Rectangular Block' (Color 13) still move two units to the right. Additionally, ACTION4 causes the existing dynamic top boundary (Color 14, 48x4) to disappear, and a new dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) to appear. Conversely, if a dynamic left boundary (Color 14, 4x48) is present, it will disappear, and a new dynamic right boundary (Color 14, 4x48) will appear. This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.",

There was a green 'landmass' (Color 4: 8x12 shape at (20,32)) directly to its right, which acted as an obstacle and blocked its movement. This obstruction prevented the main block from moving, but allowed the 'Moving Irregular Block' and 'Moving Rectangular Block' to move two units to the right. The dynamic top border was present, leading to its disappearance and the appearance of the dynamic right border.",
