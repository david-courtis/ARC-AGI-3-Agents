  "new_definition": "ACTION1 attempts to move the movable block two units upwards. If the movable block IS NOT obstructed, it moves two units upwards, causes a dynamic bottom boundary (Color 14) to DISAPPEAR, and a dynamic top boundary (Color 14) to APPEAR. This action also causes other independent gameplay elements such as the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block to move two units to the LEFT. If the movable block IS obstructed from moving upwards, it does NOT move; instead, other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape or Color 13 rectangular block) may move either two units to the RIGHT or two units to the LEFT, and dynamic side boundaries (left or right) may disappear while a dynamic top boundary appears. The specific direction of movement for the other objects (left or right) when the main block is blocked appears to depend on which side boundary is present (left or right). This action does not change the movable block's color or shape.",

  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable 4x4 Color 11 (light gray) rectangular block was at (24,32). Above it, partially overlapping by a few pixels at (20,32) was a green 'landmass' object (Color 4: 8x12 shape at (20,20) - this is the source of the obstruction in the path of the Movable Block at (24,32)). This green landmass obstructed the upward movement of the main movable block. This obstruction, in the presence of a dynamic right side border at (8,56), caused the secondary effect where the other movable objects (Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) moved horizontally to the right, and the dynamic right border transformed into a dynamic top border.",
