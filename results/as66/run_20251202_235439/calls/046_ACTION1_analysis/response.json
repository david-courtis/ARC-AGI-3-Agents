Instead, it triggers a different effect: a Color 12 irregular shape moves two units to the right, a Color 13 rectangular block moves two units to the right, and the dynamic left border (Color 14, 4x48) disappears while a dynamic top border (Color 14, 48x4) appears.",

This obstruction led to a different, secondary effect where other objects (the Color 12 irregular shape and Color 13 rectangular block) moved horizontally, and the dynamic left border transformed into a dynamic top border.",
