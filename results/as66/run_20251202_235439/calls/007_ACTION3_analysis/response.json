  "interpretation": "The 4x4 black rectangular block at (28, 40) moved two units to the left, from column 40 to column 38. A new color 14 block (4x48) appeared at (8, 4), which is on the left side of the play area as part of the border. Simultaneously, the previous appearing dark blue rectangular block (48x4) at (56,8) from ACTION2 has disappeared. A previous observation stated this 'Appearing Right Side Block' was created by a previous action and was a 'dynamic boundary or an effect of the action'.",
  "update_definition": true,
  "new_definition": "ACTION3 moves the movable block 2 units to the left. It also causes the previous dynamic right boundary to disappear and a new dynamic left boundary to appear.",
  "is_consistent_with_previous": false,
  "context_that_caused_this_outcome": "The movable block was at a position (28,40) where it could move left without encountering an obstacle within the two-unit movement radius. The appearance and disappearance of specific border elements might be a consequence of the action itself, or part of a larger 'level design' or 'stage progression' mechanism. The right border appeared due to ACTION2. Now it disappeared and a left border appeared. This suggests that the action triggered a specific 'world state' change where left movement causes a right border to disappear and a left border to appear.",

    "The 4x4 black block is confirmed as a movable object that can move horizontally, in this case, 2 units to the left.",
    "The border elements previously identified as 'dynamic' are indeed dynamic and can appear and disappear. This action caused the disappearance of the right-side dynamic border and the appearance of a similar new left-side dynamic border. This suggests these blocks function as temporary walls or barriers that change based on gameplay actions.",
    "The movement of the black block is 2 units left, not necessarily 'decrease column/x by 1' as originally hinted. This contradicts the semantic hint."
