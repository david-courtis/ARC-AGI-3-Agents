ACTION4: ACTION4 moves the movable block four units to the left. This action also causes the dynamic left-side Color 14 block to disappear and a new dynamic right-side Color 14 block to appear. Additionally, new UI elements appear: a Color 13 rectangular block (16x1) at (0, 24) and a Color 12 irregular shape (24x63) at (0, 40).
  Reason: The observed object-level changes clearly indicate the appearance of the two new UI elements and specifically state the movable block moved by four units to the left.
