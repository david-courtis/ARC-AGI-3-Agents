The appearance of new blocks and the color change could be side effects of the action or a mechanism to simulate 'level progression' or 'move consumption'. The environment boundary and other objects didn't obstruct the downward movement of the color 8 block. The movement itself was not stopped by anything, it was a fixed 4-unit shift.",
