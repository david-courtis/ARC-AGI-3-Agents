  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "We are at the start of exploration with no verified actions. The semantic hint suggests ACTION1 is 'Move UP'. Looking at the board, the black U-shaped object (likely the avatar) has clear open space above it, making this a safe and high-probability test to observe movement and confirm the avatar's identity.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm if ACTION1 causes vertical movement (UP) and definitively identify the player character (likely the black U-shape).",
  "current_board_assessment": "The game appears to be a 2D grid world. There is a black U-shaped entity near the bottom with open space above it. Green structures and an orange target/object are visible. No immediate obstacles block upward movement."
