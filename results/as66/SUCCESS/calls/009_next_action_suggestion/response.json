  "reasoning": "ACTION4 (Move RIGHT) has never been observed. The agent recently performed ACTION3 (Move LEFT) and collided with an obstacle, meaning it is currently resting against an obstruction to its left. Logic dictates that the path to the RIGHT (the direction it came from or parallel to it) must be clear. This is the perfect condition to test the 'Move RIGHT' mechanic to verify if it follows the same sliding physics as observed with ACTION2 and ACTION3.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm that ACTION4 moves the agent to the RIGHT. We will specifically observe if the movement is a 'slide' that continues until it hits the blue border wall on the right side, consistent with the behavior of ACTION2 and ACTION3. We also verify the semantic hint for ACTION4.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The agent (Orange Block) is positioned against a large Green obstacle structure on its left side. The path to the right appears to be clear red floor, extending to the blue border wall."
