Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)\n2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)\n3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to\ndiscover context-dependent behaviors."

    "reasoning": "The recent attempt to use ACTION1 (Move UP) resulted in no effect, which aligns with the visual evidence that the orange agent is blocked by green walls above it. Inspecting the board, the agent appears to be enclosed by green walls on the top, left, and right, but the path immediately below is clear (brown background). Therefore, ACTION2 (Move DOWN) is the action most likely to result in successful movement from the current position.",
    "expected_information_gain": "We expect to verify if ACTION2 behaves as 'Move DOWN'. A successful move will also confirm that the orange block is indeed the player-controlled avatar and establish the first verified movement capability.",
    "current_board_assessment": "The agent (orange block) is positioned in the upper portion of the map, seemingly trapped inside a green structure open only to the bottom. Movement is likely restricted to the downward direction."
