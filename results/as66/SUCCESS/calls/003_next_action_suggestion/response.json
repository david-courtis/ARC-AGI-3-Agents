  "target_action": "ACTION2",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "The recent attempt to use ACTION1 (Move UP) resulted in no effect, which aligns with the visual evidence that the orange agent is blocked by green walls above it. Inspecting the board, the agent appears to be enclosed by green walls on the top, left, and right, but the path immediately below is clear (brown background). Therefore, ACTION2 (Move DOWN) is the action most likely to result in successful movement from the current position.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to verify if ACTION2 behaves as 'Move DOWN'. A successful move will also confirm that the orange block is indeed the player-controlled avatar and establish the first verified movement capability.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The agent (orange block) is positioned in the upper portion of the map, seemingly trapped inside a green structure open only to the bottom. Movement is likely restricted to the downward direction."
