Decide what action to test next.

CURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:
  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move UP (Decrease Y). If the target position is occupied by a wall/obstacle, the move results in no position change.
  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move DOWN. The agent slides in the downward direction until it collides with an obstacle (e.g., green wall).
  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET
  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET

ENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:
⚠️ NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.

BACKGROUND: Dark Red (Color 9)

BORDER: Yes (Blue (Color 12) inner rim, Green (Color 3) outer rim)
  Description: A structured frame. Outer edge is green/cyan. Inner edge surrounding the play area is a blue rectangular border. There are specific colored markers (Magenta, Yellow) embedded in the top and bottom borders.

SPATIAL STRUCTURE:
  Grid-based arena (approx 64x64) surrounded by walls. The interior is open 'floor' populated by scattered rocky/forest obstacles.

DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
  A top-down sliding-block puzzle game. The goal is to maneuver the orange agent into a specific target (likely the black U-shaped socket) by sliding it across the red floor. The challenge comes from the sliding mechanics—once moving, the agent doesn't stop until it hits a green wall or the room border, requiring the player to use obstacles as backstops to navigate.

KEY BREAKTHROUGHS:
  - Confirmed 'Sliding' Mechanics: The game is not step-by-step; the agent slides until collision.
  - Identified UI Elements: The top and bottom borders contain dynamic elements (color changing bars) that likely track game state (moves/time).
  - Identified Goal Candidate: The Black U-shape is the most likely objective.

UNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):
  - The function of the Magenta block (Color 13) at the top center.
  - The exact coordinate mapping (the text log coords seemed partially inconsistent with the visual agent location, requiring verification).

MOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
  - Agent cannot move through Green obstacles.
  - Agent cannot move through Blue border walls.
  - Movement is 'sliding': The agent moves in a direction until it hits a wall/obstacle (based on Action 2 definition).

INTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:
  - Green (Color 3) irregular patches acting as terrain obstacles

IDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):
  - Agent: Orange (Color 8) Square (4x4 pixels) (Role hypothesis: Player Character)
      Evidence: This object moved in response to ACTION2 (Move DOWN). It is distinct and centrally located on the play field.
  - Wall / Terrain: Green (Color 3) Irregular blobs (Role hypothesis: Obstacle)
      Evidence: The agent movement is described as 'slides until it collides'. Examples show the agent resting adjacent to these green shapes. They obstruct the red background.
  - Goal: Black (Color 0) U-shape / Cup (Role hypothesis: Target / Goal)
      Evidence: Unique object in the room. Distinct shape resembling a receptacle or socket. In puzzle games, such objects are typically destinations.
  - Top UI Bar: Blue (Color 12) Horizontal line/bar (Role hypothesis: Timer / Move Counter)
      Evidence: Located in the top border area. Log indicates a color change (14 -> 12) happened here, suggesting a state update linked to the move.
  - Bottom UI Bar: Light Pink (Color 14/11) Horizontal block (Role hypothesis: Status Indicator)
      Evidence: Identified as 'Color 14 rectangular block... APPEARED' at the bottom of the screen. Its appearance correlates with the action.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  - What specific condition triggers the 'Color 14 -> 12' change in the top bar? Is it a moves counter limiting the player?
  - Does the Black U-shape verify victory upon contact or overlap?

Legacy Objects:
  - Color 8 (Orange 4x4 Block - Likely Agent): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 4 (Green Objects - Walls): Involved in ACTION1 action
  - Color 8 (Orange Agent): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 4 (Green Wall): Involved in ACTION2 action
  - Color 14 (Pink Bar UI): Involved in ACTION2 action

Recent Observations:
  - The objects Color 4 (green shapes) act as solid walls effectively blocking movement.
  - Action 'Move UP' is blocked by walls.
  - Green objects (Color 4) generally function as solid walls that stop movement.
  - Movement mechanics appear to be 'sliding' (continuous movement until collision) rather than discrete single steps.
  - A pink bar (Color 14) toggles between the top and bottom of the play area, likely serving as a turn indicator or state mechanism.
