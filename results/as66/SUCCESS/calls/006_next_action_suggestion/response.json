  "target_action": "ACTION3",
  "setup_sequence": [],
  "reasoning": "ACTION3 (likely Move LEFT) has never been tested. Visually, the path to the left of the agent (orange block) appears completely open, whereas the path to the right (ACTION4) and down (ACTION2) appear blocked by the green obstacle the agent is currently touching. Testing an action in a clear direction maximizes the chance of observing a positive result (movement) to verify the action's definition.",
  "expected_information_gain": "We expect to confirm that ACTION3 corresponds to moving LEFT (decreasing X coordinate). We also expect to see the 'sliding' behavior continue, validating that the agent moves until it hits the wall or the Black U-shaped object.",
  "current_board_assessment": "The agent (Orange) is nesting against a Green obstacle to its right and possibly bottom. The previous 'Move DOWN' action succeeded, placing it here. The Left and Up directions appear open."
