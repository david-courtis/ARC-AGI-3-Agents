Actions that have never been observed (highest priority)\n2. Actions that need more validation (not yet verified)\n3. Whether the current game state is good for testing the chosen action\n\nAn action is \"verified\" when you have 3 consistent observations of what it does.\n\nCRITICAL: If an action had NO EFFECT in the current state, DO NOT test it again\nin the same state! Instead:\n1. Use a SETUP SEQUENCE of verified movement actions to reach a DIFFERENT position\n2. Then test the action from the new position\n3. Actions may only work in specific contexts (e.g., interact only works when near an object)\n\nIf the current state is not good for testing an action (e.g., against a wall when\ntesting movement, or no nearby objects for interaction), you MUST suggest a\nSETUP SEQUENCE of verified actions to reach a better state first.\n\nBe strategic and efficient in your exploration. Vary positions frequently to\ndiscover context-dependent behaviors."

        "text": "Decide what action to test next.\n\nACTION SEMANTIC HINTS (these are hints, verify through observation):\n  ACTION1: Move UP (decrease row/y)\n  ACTION2: Move DOWN (increase row/y)\n  ACTION3: Move LEFT (decrease column/x)\n  ACTION4: Move RIGHT (increase column/x)\n  ACTION5: INTERACT/SELECT/ROTATE at current position\n\nCURRENT ACTION KNOWLEDGE STATUS:\n  ACTION1: 0/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move UP (Decrease Y). If the target position is occupied by a wall/obstacle, the move results in no position change.\n  ACTION2: 1/3 consistent, 1/8 attempts | Def: Move DOWN. The agent slides in the downward direction until it collides with an obstacle (e.g., green wall).\n  ACTION3: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION4: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n  ACTION5: NO OBSERVATIONS YET\n\nRECENT ACTION HISTORY (last 10 actions taken):\n  1. ACTION1: \u2717 NO EFFECT - The action ACTION1 (expected 'Move UP') resulted in no chang...\n  2. ACTION2: \u2713 EFFECT - The action caused the agent (orange block, Color 8) to move ...\n\nENVIRONMENT UNDERSTANDING:\n\u26a0\ufe0f NOTE: This understanding is TENTATIVE and may be WRONG. If observations contradict it, the model should be UPDATED.\n\nBACKGROUND: Dark Red (Color 9)\n\nBORDER: Yes (Blue (Color 12) inner rim, Green (Color 3) outer rim)\n  Description: A structured frame. Outer edge is green/cyan. Inner edge surrounding the play area is a blue rectangular border. There are specific colored markers (Magenta, Yellow) embedded in the top and bottom borders.\n\nSPATIAL STRUCTURE:\n  Grid-based arena (approx 64x64) surrounded by walls. The interior is open 'floor' populated by scattered rocky/forest obstacles.\n\nDOMAIN DESCRIPTION:\n  A top-down sliding-block puzzle game. The goal is to maneuver the orange agent into a specific target (likely the black U-shaped socket) by sliding it across the red floor. The challenge comes from the sliding mechanics\u2014once moving, the agent doesn't stop until it hits a green wall or the room border, requiring the player to use obstacles as backstops to navigate.\n\nKEY BREAKTHROUGHS:\n  - Confirmed 'Sliding' Mechanics: The game is not step-by-step; the agent slides until collision.\n  - Identified UI Elements: The top and bottom borders contain dynamic elements (color changing bars) that likely track game state (moves/time).\n  - Identified Goal Candidate: The Black U-shape is the most likely objective.\n\nUNEXPLORED ELEMENTS (need investigation):\n  - The function of the Magenta block (Color 13) at the top center.\n  - The exact coordinate mapping (the text log coords seemed partially inconsistent with the visual agent location, requiring verification).\n\nMOVEMENT CONSTRAINTS:\n  - Agent cannot move through Green obstacles.\n  - Agent cannot move through Blue border walls.\n  - Movement is 'sliding': The agent moves in a direction until it hits a wall/obstacle (based on Action 2 definition).\n\nINTERNAL WALLS/OBSTACLES:\n  - Green (Color 3) irregular patches acting as terrain obstacles\n\nIDENTIFIED OBJECTS (TENTATIVE - may be wrong!):\n  - Agent: Orange (Color 8) Square (4x4 pixels) (Role hypothesis: Player Character)\n      Evidence: This object moved in response to ACTION2 (Move DOWN). It is distinct and centrally located on the play field.\n  - Wall / Terrain: Green (Color 3) Irregular blobs (Role hypothesis: Obstacle)\n      Evidence: The agent movement is described as 'slides until it collides'. Examples show the agent resting adjacent to these green shapes. They obstruct the red background.\n  - Goal: Black (Color 0) U-shape / Cup (Role hypothesis: Target / Goal)\n      Evidence: Unique object in the room. Distinct shape resembling a receptacle or socket. In puzzle games, such objects are typically destinations.\n  - Top UI Bar: Blue (Color 12) Horizontal line/bar (Role hypothesis: Timer / Move Counter)\n      Evidence: Located in the top border area. Log indicates a color change (14 -> 12) happened here, suggesting a state update linked to the move.\n  - Bottom UI Bar: Light Pink (Color 14/11) Horizontal block (Role hypothesis: Status Indicator)\n      Evidence: Identified as 'Color 14 rectangular block... APPEARED' at the bottom of the screen. Its appearance correlates with the action.\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS:\n  - What specific condition triggers the 'Color 14 -> 12' change in the top bar? Is it a moves counter limiting the player?\n  - Does the Black U-shape verify victory upon contact or overlap?\n\nLegacy Objects:\n  - Color 8 (Orange 4x4 Block - Likely Agent): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 4 (Green Objects - Walls): Involved in ACTION1 action\n  - Color 8 (Orange Agent): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 4 (Green Wall): Involved in ACTION2 action\n  - Color 14 (Pink Bar UI): Involved in ACTION2 action\n\nRecent Observations:\n  - The objects Color 4 (green shapes) act as solid walls effectively blocking movement.\n  - Action 'Move UP' is blocked by walls.\n  - Green objects (Color 4) generally function as solid walls that stop movement.\n  - Movement mechanics appear to be 'sliding' (continuous movement until collision) rather than discrete single steps.\n  - A pink bar (Color 14) toggles between the top and bottom of the play area, likely serving as a turn indicator or state mechanism.\n\nVERIFIED ACTIONS (can use for setup): None\nPENDING ACTIONS (need testing): ACTION1, ACTION2, ACTION3, ACTION4, ACTION5\n\nRECENT NO-EFFECT ATTEMPTS: ACTION1: 1 recent no-effect attempts\n\nLooking at the current game state (image shown), decide:\n1. Which action should we test next?\n2. Do we need a setup sequence first to reach a better position?\n3. Why this choice?\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If an action had NO EFFECT recently, you MUST use a setup sequence to MOVE first\n- Do NOT repeat the same action in the same state - it will have no effect again\n- Use verified movement actions (ACTION1-4) in setup_sequence to change position\n- Only after moving to a NEW position should you retry a no-effect action\n\nProvide your structured suggestion."
