# ARC-AGI-3 Scoring Methodology

> How ARC-AGI-3 scoring works

ARC-AGI-3 uses **Relative Human Action Efficiency** (RHAE, pronounced "ray") to score AI systems.

RHAE measures per-level action efficiency compared to a human baseline, normalized per game, across all games.

## What Gets Measured

AI is scored on two criteria:

1. **Completion** — How many levels did the AI complete in each game?
2. **Efficiency** — How many actions did the AI take compared to humans?

## What Counts as an Action

An *action* is a discrete interaction with the environment. Each turn where the agent submits a command, move, or input that affects the game state counts as an action.

Internal operations that do not alter the environment (tool calls, reasoning steps, retries) are **not counted** as actions.

## Human Baseline

Human baselines are established through controlled testing where participants play each ARC-AGI-3 game for the first time (having never seen the game before). For each game, multiple first-time players are observed, and the **2nd best human** (fewest actions) per game is recorded as the baseline.

Using the 2nd best human:

* Removes outlier winners while still representing proficient human performance
* Avoids penalizing for early misclicks
* Keeps the baseline grounded in real play, not theoretical speed-runs

## How Scoring Works

### Per-Level Scoring

For each level the AI completes, calculate:

```
level_score = (human_baseline_actions / ai_actions) ^ 2
```

* If human baseline is 10 actions and AI takes 10 → level score is 1.0 (100%)
* If human baseline is 10 actions and AI takes 20 → level score is 0.25 (50%)
* If human baseline is 10 actions and AI takes 1,00 → level score is 0.01 (1%)

### Per-Level Score Cap

The maximum score per level is capped at **1.0x** human baseline. If an AI discovers a shortcut and completes a level faster than humans, it still only receives 1.0.

This encourages building AI that **generalizes across games** rather than exploiting individual levels.

### Per-Game Aggregation

The game score is the **weighted average** of all per-level scores, using a 1 index of the level as the weight, for that game.

**Example:** A game has 7 levels. The AI scores:

* Levels 1-3: 0.25 each (took twice as many actions as human)
* Levels 4-7: 0 each (did not complete the level)

Game score = (0.25x1 + 0.25x2 + 0.5x3 + 0x4 + 0x5 + 0x6 + 0x7) / (1+2+3+4+5+6+7) = **0.01289 (1.29%)**

Per-level weighted average underweights the starting levels which are tutorial/easy levels and overweights the more difficult levels where mastery must be demonstrated.

### Total Score

Total score is the **average of all game scores**, resulting in a final score between 0% and 100%.

## Score Interpretation

| Score | Interpretation                                                                |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100%  | AI completes all games/levels while matching or surpassing human efficiency   |
| 1-99% | A mixture of level completion rates and efficiency relative to human baseline |
| 0%    | AI never completes a level across any game                                    |
